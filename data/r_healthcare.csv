healthcare,"&gt;So, if USA raised their taxes, and you got less in your paycheck, then healthcare could be ""FREE"" here also.

No one is claiming Canada has ""free"" Healthcare. The US just allocates taxes in a different way. You possibly cannot raise the taxes here anymore without driving people to be homeless. The US already has programs like Medicare and medicaid that need more money allocated to them without even getting to the issue of universal coverage.

&gt; Hospitals here will also take you same day if you have an emergency

Reason why so many people end up in the ER for minor issues, therefor, crowding the ER and affecting wait times because they cannot afford insurance.

&gt;the price you paid in Canada for services is the same price that services cost in the USA

Ummmmm no.

&gt; two people at a minimum have to handle your insurance, one at the doc and one at the insurance company. That's two salaries that have to be paid

Unnecessary costs that keep private insurance companies in business and the American people poor

&gt; In Canada you also have health boards that decide what you can and can't have done.

What place doesn't have health boards? Also, less malpractice cases. 

&gt;Think about it, if someone doesn't have to see or handle the money to get healthcare services, how likely are they to not abuse it? If they don't pay, why not get everything under the sun checked out? 

Abusing Healthcare services is a common myth thats helps keep the health care costs in the US high. Studies have shown that people really just don't turn up at the doctors office just for kicks."

healthcare,"Part of the reason why ER bills are high are because the people who can pay are subsidizing the people who do not/can not pay, and also subsidizing the super sick people who require a lot of resources.

Another reason why ER/hospital bills are high are because these bills are an artificially high 'MSRP' that insurance companies/medicare demand us to show that you are getting a 'discount'.  Hospitals are not allowed, by contract, to show you a 'rack rate' if you are uninsured (if a hospital published a realistic number, medicare/insurance would request a % off of whatever rate that is.. which would be a road to bankruptcy). If you ARE uninsured, an can prove you cannot afford to pay the bill, a hospital will always lower the bill to a reasonable amount. 

No one pays the MSRP except for the uninsured/underinsured, or those with small insurance network who do not have the leverage to negotiate a good rate).  People that are part of a bigger insurance network/medicare/medicaid will have that larger institution negotiating on their behalf.

For someone who comes into the ER to get treated and evaluated for abdominal pain, as a physician, I may bill out anywhere from 300-400$, but can expect to collect around $30-40 from medicaid patients, to rarely the full amount from some generous insurance companies.  On average, I would collect about 30% of my billings (many people will pay 0, that has gone up with the advent of high deducible plans).  The expected collections of $100 for that bill for evaluating your abdominal pain (which can be as benign as a stomach virus to appendicitis to a lie threatening ruptured aneurysm) is less than what your PCP gets for seeing a sore throat after copay. It is also 4x less than what i paid my plumber to clean my sewer clog.  

The hospital bill is another story,.. think about the costs that are required to staff an ED - you are paying for the ER doctor, many nurses, techs, transporters, xray techs, lab techs, pharmacists.. 24 hrs/day. Many people will pay nothing (due to a federal mandate to evaluate everyone who comes to the ED regardless of the severity of their illness or ability to pay). Much of our resources will go towards people who have and continue to make poor decisions in their life, and are super sick. We do what we need to and treat/admit them for the 14th time that year.. and they are likely on medicaid, which will reimburse approx 10% of the billings.  There is a small subset who will have good private insurance who if we are lucky might pay 75% of our billings... but these people are rare because they rarely get sick, but are good because when they come in, they help keep the lights on to take care of everyone else.

healthcare,"I live in East Tennessee and work in healthcare. Private hospitals are way more common than not-for-profit and I cannot imagine how any other system is worse. People say that we’ll start to see long lines for care but here, there is no line because very few can afford care. Our ERs are ALWAYS full for very basic conditions because no one can afford insurance or to go to a doctor. It’s so sad to see someone who can’t work because they have cancer not qualify for any insurance coverage because they don’t have a type of cancer that is covered under Tennessee Medicaid. "
healthcare,"Well, I just don't see evidence of that. Wealthy people will still buy private insurance. Isn't this what happens elsewhere in the world?"
healthcare,"I don't find much to disagree with.

But on why prices are as they are, here is what I have written before:

Why do we pay more for less?  Is it because the government isn’t controlling prices?  In fact it does so in our giant Medicare and Medicaid programs.  But our healthcare providers respond to this with even higher prices outside those programs’ price controls to make up for lost revenue.  So perhaps all healthcare prices should be controlled?  But Japan’s lesson says that will produce shortages,  since healthcare providers who can’t recoup costs will have to drop out of the market.  Perhaps to prevent this, the government should employ its own healthcare providers and outlaw private healthcare (to prevent flight to that more lucrative market).  But a Soviet plan—or, say a whole-population version of the travesty that is the Veteran’s Health Administration—might not be a world we want to live in!

A more thoughtful line of reasoning begins by recognizing that relatively free trade is the only mechanism known to produce functioning economies, and that abandoning its principles is perilous at the scale represented by the United States healthcare economy.   Those who look to Europe for a working example of government control in healthcare should look not at the tiny, homogenous cultures of Europe’s individual nations, but at the European Union as a whole, at whose scale they will of course find no answer at all.   We seem not to have noticed that the USA, ever the frontier, with a Medicare population alone far exceeding the whole populations of either Canada or all of Scandinavia combined, has had no choice but to be a pioneer in the design of a world-class healthcare system. 

It is perhaps understandable, then, that what has grown up in the US wilderness to address the Rubik’s Cube of a working free market healthcare system is a haphazard mix of rapacious private interest, blundering government  and romanticized medicine, all in the service of heroic ideas about mortality.   

We pay more for less in this free but severely distorted market because 

1)	the demand for survival is completely inelastic in any market, with prices rapidly approaching infinity as the threat to physical survival is increased.  

2)	The entire healthcare market has been captured by a high priesthood built around the idea of medical expertise and seemingly limitless profit.  This monopolistic control over healthcare constrains its supply, driving up already sensitive prices.

3)	Finally, government has forced the healthcare demand curve to the right by using price controls to make it seem almost free to our vast Medicare/Medicaid population (not to mention for a brief period forcing all Americans to purchase healthcare insurance), driving up prices for everyone else.

Insurance companies, sitting between healthcare providers and consumers, are often demonized either as the cause of high prices or, when they try to lower prices, as the cause of poor quality healthcare.   But this is largely an unfair displacement of blame from the true cause of the problem, which is our major, long term shortage of healthcare services.

The only responsible way to reduce prices in any environment is through market competition wherever possible.  Again, this is the only mechanism known to be viable at scale and over the long term.  Healthy competition in this context means

1)	Healthcare providers compete with each other to produce better healthcare for a lower price;

2)	Insurers compete with each other to produce better population health for lower premiums; 

3)	Consumers act as powerful bargain hunters in the effective management of their own health, thereby finding ways to demand less healthcare and igniting price competition.

But this competition is not happening right now.

healthcare,"We do not provide official answers or provide professional judgement. As always, speak to your healthcare professional for answers specific to your condition.

You have been warned about it before."
healthcare,"First off: you're talking about hospital bills. This is not the same as a clinic. Hospitals HAVE to charge that much because of the amount of people who do not pay.  Those bills are ASSUMING insurance! The hospitals in Canada have to get just as much money to operate. There may be more block grant funding, but SOMEONE is paying for it. 

If you go in to a clinic in the US and explain you have no insurance, the price will be relative to Canada. They HAVE to charge a fortune, because insurance pays so little. Insurance is like a union. They're gonna rip everyone else off as much as possible. To think healthcare offices WANT to charge that much is simply not true.

An X-ray's actual cost is probably 25 bucks. Once the machine is paid off, you simply pay for electricity and film.
MRI's can be done for maybe a couple hundred bucks. A cast cost maybe 5 dollars.  

The entire problem revolves around insurance. 2/3 of the cost of healthcare, the doc never sees. While other countries may appear better, healthcare sucks everywhere. As an enlightened animal, the human, we want to live forever. We want everything checked out that concerns us. That costs money. 

The average student loan waiting for a med school graduate is 250k. Think about that. They spend at least 11 years in school. While everyone else is buying homes, they are still in school. They HAVE to charge a lot. The ONLY revenue that comes in to a clinic is from the docs seeing patients. Front office, managers, nurses, ma's, billing people, utilities, maintenance, ......all come from the doc making money. When you pay a doc, you are paying all of those services. Now think about the staff and overhead at a hospital. It's the same story. Docs generate the revenue. MASSIVE!

You are definitely paying for your healthcare in Canada. If not directly from your income, then indirectly from other taxes...property, food, sales, etc.

healthcare,"5% of profit on 1 billion dollars is far less than 5% profit on 1 trillion dollars. 

As to your later statement ""at some point wont people walk away from the market?"" 

You just touched on what skyrocketed profits for health insurance. Buy it or be taxed by the individual mandate (much like auto insurance). Look at the price to earnings ratios of major medical insurance companies since Obamacare...it was written by lobbyists for big insurance. 

Also, do you really need full protection on a 5k cash car (20 year old in good health)? Will that bankrupt you? What about a total loss on a 120k Escalade (75 year old smoker)? What if I made u buy full protection on your $5k cash car to make Escalade car insurace cheaper for people who drive Escalades? You could refuse but ill add it to your federal tax bill and give you nothing in return. Furthermore, every car insurance policy must include engine and transmition repairs. 

I will give you a choice of 2-3 car insurance providers, but the rate you will pay will be based off of my average costs to pay out and cover 100 cars + a 5% administrative cost I get to keep for myself and financers. 

As an insurance company, i have a vested interest in skyrocketing costs of car repairs and all car mechanical work. I also want the average car cost/value  to be much as possible. Car insurers win, mechanics win, car dealers  win. part suppliers win, body shops win... Everyone but you! 

If another car insurance company that is smaller starts competing and becoming a strong 4th player I buy it to protect or raise my rates  and capture market share... I am financed by wallstreet. Wallstreet loves my profits and wants them to grow, which makes me want to drive costs up even higher and become more aggressive buying out upstart competition. 


I hope the metaphore helps. Non profit single payer wont fix everything but it fixes a ton and thats why lobbyists will never allow a pure manifestation of it. 

And not just insurance lobbyists, add big pharma, providers, health networks, doctors and primary providers, healthcare associations, medical equipment manufacturers (a cartel in its own right)...its too much to fight post ""People's United"" supreme court decision that gave lobbyists tremendous power... Short of a revolution of sorts. "

And going to hospital/clinic without  copay will at the end destroy the health care system (e.g. Germany). The most fair and realistic system, in my opinion, is Swiss model.

The US healthcare system is STATIC? Really? Honestly? You believe that? Have your rates gone up in the last 5 years? Mine surely did when I was there. My parents even complained that their insurance doubled in price the last few years. Static? Honestly?

You're arguing that I'm creating more middlemen by wanting to get rid of insurance? I'm quite confused by that strawman you've created. 

Another strawman. Where did I say that 10k for a procedure equals 10k for the doctor? I'm making the assumption that the doctor will get the largest billet of that 10k. Even using that math, paying off X amount of student dept would be easy when a doctor can do 3-4-5 of these procedures every day. Putting words into my mouth to argue against is pretty much the definition of a strawman, and that is just silly nonsense. 

And you're right, the government doesn't typically spend money wisely. Hence why the US has a military budget that's 1000x too expensive. Did you know that the US military has something like 10-11 aircraft carriers. Want to take a guess at how many the rest of the world has? Something like 10-11. I'm arguing that the flawed system that is the government would handle insurance and healthcare better than the private companies we currently have who are gouging the american people over something that SHOULD be a basic human right. Healthcare. Get rid of the middlemen. Get rid of the insurance companies. It's in the insurance companies best interest to make procedures and doctor visits as expensive as possible. The opposite is true for a government system. 

Thinking that the US healthcare ""system"" is even close to the level of any other country's is... hilarious. It's not even in the same league. It's awful. It truly is. You said your daughter was in a Germany hospital. Did she get treated without any problems? Did she have a huge bill? I'm guessing no. I'm guessing the whole process was simple and easy and no-stress (other than the injury/illness.)

Also doctors are reporting lower and lower job satisfaction as their frustrated too by their options for treatment their patients being tied up by insurers vetoing what they will or will not pay for that patient to have and their ability to treat patients being based on what the insurance companies deem to be the reasonably appropriate drug/procedure for treating the condition the patient is needing treatment for- and the insurance company makes that call not on what's actually the best or most appropriate choice medically for the patient or in treating the condition but based on whatever is cheapest for the insurer that network contract cycle.

healthcare,"&gt; But the for profit health insurance companies are, without a doubt, the worst of the worst

Eh, not really. The big ones run at around 5% profit margin. Lets say you waved a wand and turned them into nonprofits, and reduced executive compensation to $0. You might save 6%. And there would still be provider networks, because its their best tool for incentivizing people to go to lower cost providers and facilities. 

If you did get rid of provider networks, the higher costs wouldnt come from their operating income. It would come from higher premiums. There are some plans that make this tradeoff, but most people dont want that."
healthcare,"Yes should be fine. "
healthcare,"You would have to get your hands on the provider contract with the insurance company (good luck with that). Payment bonuses and reductions would be included in that. 

Really you should start with the bill and the billing codes, contracted rate for each code, and root cause of any denied payment. If insurance denies a billing claim that had a root cause of lack of provider info/documentation for the code, instead of eating the cost they bill the patient. 

In summary. Insurance denies payment due to lack of provider documentation/need. Provider bills patient instead of admitting fault or providing insurance company a corrected billing code or required supporting documentation. 

I had an RN coworker who had premature twins in NICU. We have excellent health insurance, her dad is a retired lawyer and she knows all about insurance. It took her 3 months, over 10 certified letters and countless hours of research to get to the bottom of shitty hospital billing coders and terrible hospital documentation, including lack of an in network specialist to get our empoyers health insurance and hospital to pay the over $200k of 1.2million overall bill they attempted to collect and threatened collection agency action ect ect...

healthcare,"Sure!

Germany has a socialized healthcare system by which the very large majority of the healthcare cost is paid for by the government by which the funds come from taxes. Supplemental healthcare and insurance exists, but is rarely used due to it's expense. 

Germany's healthcare system is just Canada's healthcare system with different clothing. In Germany you still ""have"" insurance, but that insurance is mostly paid for by the government. In Canada they skip that step and say ""yeah you all have insurance and don't worry about the paperwork.""

I'm confused as to how you don't see the similarities? Two of the three countries have healthcare systems heavily funded by the government with only minor contributions from the citizens, while one is just the opposite. How can you not see that the German system is completely different than the US system? Insofar that the US system provides NOTHING toward the majority of the populations' insurance? Are you hung up on the fact that they still have employer ""provided"" insurance? Despite that insurance being part of the social care network of the country? That would be the equivalent of saying ""Everyone in the US has Obamacare through their job, and everyone has to pay 7% of their wages for it."" Since that's obviously not true, I'm confused as to how you're relating Germany's system with the US's. 

Where are you getting 10% from? The only 10% in either of the articles I listed stated that 10% of German citizens have private healthcare over the social healthcare. Or are you rounding from the 7% paid by German citizens? 

Let me lay something on you...

Ahem... You do know that the 2nd most expensive thing that taxes pay for in the US is healthcare? So you're paying way more than 10% of your taxes in healthcare, just not for you... unless you're on Obamacare...  So, unlike other countries, you get nothing from the taxes collected from you that go toward healthcare. 

Wouldn't you rather be the beneficiary from your own taxes? I find it hilarious that you argue so strongly against socialized healthcare, yet in reality the US system is just socialized healthcare that EVERYONE pays for, but only poor people benefit from. So it's stacked against people like you! The social programs NEED to be there, as indicated by the declaration of independence (and well... common decency), so why not benefit yourself? "

My question is what do we change it to. Single payer is not a uniform system and each country has its share of problems, funding shortfalls and administration hurdles. 

Give your example of what the best single payer is for the US. Also, please include referenced studies and cost analysis to support your argument. Vox articles are not credible so please refrain from news outlets.

The problem with your comments is lacking content. You criticize opinion of editorial journal without rebutting counter argument and sources. This article is merely journalistic opinion pieced together by back of the napkin research. You recommend change but change to what exactly? When the Rand foundation studies show that the US would need a average tax increase of 17% to pay for comprehensive single payer, how do we best raise these funds? Even if progressive tax models, this still hurts the poor. Even if flat rate, this still effects poor and middle class households. Change to what? How will the economic impact effect ancillary markets and what is the collateral industry damage by creating a single payer fixed price model ? Is there something better than single payer or is this a political ideology without relevance to factual critical review. Or is it just a bumper sticker you stick on everything to espouse your opinion without knowing any relevant data.

healthcare,"Someone please help me understand this situation better. Either this scenario is insane or I'm deeply ignorant on certain aspects of healthcare in the US.

I'm a stage 3 kidney cancer survivor diagnosed during my time attending university. Memorial Sloan Kettering performed my surgery, my lone insignificant insurance policy through the university was exhausted very quickly, and I was fortunate enough to receive charity care for the ~$150k in medical costs subsequent to the procedure. Whether or not I could physically proceed with the surgery was never in question and I wasn't preapproved by my half-assed university health insurance. I was even an out-of-state patient as a NJ resident going to a hospital in NYC.

I'm a liberal and support universal healthcare, as I believe healthcare should be a right for all US citizens. I'm entirely opposed to a for-profit healthcare system.

However, with that said, why was this woman unable to get potentially life-saving surgery without her insurance company's approval? In other words, why was this entirely pegged on the insurance company's approval?

Why couldn't she have the surgery, and attempt to get charity care/donations after the procedure? If the hospital said screw that, couldn't they sign an agreement for a long-term payment plan?

Worst case scenario, they ultimately breach the payment plan contract and/or declare bankruptcy. Yes, this is despicable that you'd have to potentially declare bankruptcy, but surely having two parents declaring bankruptcy is more favorable to a child losing a parent.

Are some hospitals allowed to actually block a life-saving procedure without insurance approval? If that's the case, I find it hard to believe every doctor involved with her care was also subsequently affiliated with a hospital refusing to authorize the procedure."
healthcare,"&gt; I had a preventative visit with my doctor in July of 2017. The doctor ordered basic metabolic panel (BMP), thyroid and cholesterol labs as part of this visit.

And since it was a preventive service, as far as I'm aware it should have no copay, coinsurance, deductible or any other cost-sharing as part of the ACA.  "

If you take all of it and qualify for more, you will get the rest when you file your taxes. If you take all of it and end up making more money than you estimated, you may have to pay back some or all of it. If you end up making little enough to qualify for Medicaid expansion or put you in the Medicaid gap, you will not have to payback the tax credit.

Where were you going for an appointment where people presumably without an appointment were also hanging out? 

If it was a hospital I can definitely see an appointment getting pushed back. People who are currently dying have precedence over people who are dying more... slowly. The two times I was in the ER everyone there was... well... normal? No one I would have said was homeless or smelly or rude in any way.

Do you think it would have been different if you had gone to a similar ""insert place you went here"" in a similar city in the US at a similar time for a similar purpose?

healthcare,"Those are ways of us contributing for healthcare. It all depends on your plan. The UK does have these types of insurance plans you just have to buy them. (Private plans) Copays are a lump sum fee pre determined by the insurance company. You would typically add these to help lower your monthly premium. Co insurance is the similar to copays but instead of a paying a lump sum fee you would pay a percentage of the car provided. So you pays 15% of the totalcare while the insurance company would pay the remaining 85%. This type of plan further reduces your monthly premium because you are tacking on more risk. High deductible health plans mean that the you pay up to 2,000-5,000 dollars worth of these types of costs before you’re rates lower and insurance covers more. There are more intricacies with health insurance depending on your company, plan and the network such as PPOs, ACOs and HMOs and stuff like that but that just complicates things. 

But to answer your question, not really. The main difference between us and other countries is the types of services we are willing to provide vs other countries and the time it takes to see a provider. Typically in universal healthcare countries it could take up to 14 months to see a specialist, whereas you could see one here today. We will pay for expensive procedures that are super rare and have a lower chance of working than they would, but that’s because we choose the individuals right to care over cost. Unfortunately that means the people who can’t afford care do not have coverage. There’s a balance to both the good and the bad of us vs them. Neither system is perfect and both have their flaws. But i do agree with everyone else in that the prices are inflating way to quickly and need to be contained."

Also, there are polls that show that the large majority want universal health care. Numerous examples around the world show that it is cheaper and better. The corporate lobbyists want it to stay the way it is, nobody else does."

healthcare,"First thing:

Canadian healthcare is not ""FREE"".
You are paying for that service. Canada has a nanny government that takes your money and decides how it will be spent. Think about what your proposing. Who would pay all of the healthcare in Canada? Governments cannot be for profit, revenue machines. The revenue that runs government services are all of us!

So, if USA raised their taxes, and you got less in your paycheck, then healthcare could be ""FREE"" here also.

Second, you hit the head when you mentioned that you  were seeking services for an urgent matter and not primary care. Hospitals here will also take you same day if you have an emergency.

Third, the price you paid in Canada for services is the same price that services cost in the USA. When you pay insurance premiums, you are not paying for free care. You are hedging your health against the risks. There are limits to care and insurance companies must annually revise limits in order to stay viable. Just like if you paid for a lot of services out of pocket in Canada, the price would add up; insurance in USA pre-configures what they think you will use and sets a baseline floor to not fall beneath.

Fourth, if you pay for healthcare in USA, out of pocket, with no insurance, you will probably pay around those same prices, if not cheaper. Insurance administration eats up 2/3 of healthcare. This is why we pay so much in insurances for every visit you make to the doc, two people at a minimum have to handle your insurance, one at the doc and one at the insurance company. That's two salaries that have to be paid.

I know it seems like awesome healthcare in Canada, and I by no means want to call it inferior. Canadian healthcare costs are invisible to you, unless you look, but trust me, you ARE paying those costs. In Canada you also have health boards that decide what you can and can't have done.

In time, costs will catch up in Canada and as moral hazard is increased do to trends, they will have problems providing quality medicine.

There is not one country in the world that has perfect healthcare. Ever since the free market was eliminated in healthcare, costs keep going up. Think about it, if someone doesn't have to see or handle the money to get healthcare services, how likely are they to not abuse it? If they don't pay, why not get everything under the sun checked out? Some older people in USA go to the doc to get their toe nails trimmed. Sound reasonable? 170 dollar visit to trim their nails?"

healthcare,"Thanks everyone. It seems like from a few of these responses people assumed something negative like I'm somehow gaming the system and looking for ways to manuever it against the medical system and not pay people somehow. I am sorry you relate to the world in such a way off the bat like that. The rest of you, thanks. I didn't provide a lot of info I guess I should have but not really. Most of you looked way further than or into areas that did not matter pertaining my question and made assumptions and guesses instead of just answering the question, and in such have provided not only false information, but complete nonsense and wasted everyone's time. 
I asked why a doctor would require me to make them my primary care physician to be seen, and people instead went on to guess I had some type of plan or that the doctors weren't getting paid or I didn't have a PCP at all.

I have a PCP I enjoy very much, which is a reason I am hesitant to just switch like that. I have a family Medicaid plan given to me for free because I am not wealthy, so there's not much I've been turned down for at all, and I get referrals for every specialist I see directly from my primary care physician. I work in data research in the medical field and understand the insurance and payments and why these things cost so much more than most people, and likely yourself do. I'm not just some guy trying to get over and scam doctors out of the money they are owed for their time, valuable knowledge, and opinions in the practice of health and life. To even entertain such a thought disgusts me in you to my very core, which has prompted the tone of this response.

The correct answer here was given by /U/optical_mommy and they simply want to make it easier to go through the process by not requiring I have referrals.

There is no reason an infectious disease specialist would need to be made my primary care on a first visit, as I doubt I would be going to him for primary care reasons unless I already had a condition and was already going to him for it, in which case it would be primary care and would make more sense in you people's bizarro world scenarios. 

Stop getting so defensive, nobody is trying to con you or hurt you, and life is beautiful. I appreciate all of your time and efforts, and urge you to seek the point in yourself that sees things as negatives or possibilities for hurting you, and makes you react defensively like that. It's not pretty and is destructive in your life choices and relationships. Namaste."

It’s not perfect else where but single payer would, not initially but over time, greatly stifle innovation and basic and translational research. It puts the control in the hands of government employees who know nothing about what it’s actually like to deliver healthcare (not that it’s wonderful as it currently stands with MBAs managing large hospitals and the insurance companies, but this would be worse).

healthcare,"""improving things"" is too general.

Lowering costs and increasing coverage we can talk about of course, although the latter is a bit of a potemkin village. Coverage is not care.

There are several realistic actions we could take to put downward pressure on costs. Easing immigration standards for foreign physicians/medical staff would be a great place to start; increasing the supply of qualified labor will decrease the cost required to attract and retain said labor. Decreasing the regulatory burden and cost of FDA approval for new pharmaceuticals would be another good move - along with some changes to patent law to allow earlier competition among manufacturers. Implementing a national insurance market, rather than state-based markets, would be a great way to expand the coverage options available to anyone purchasing privately and likely result in cost/value competition within insurance plans as well. 

There's some overlap on that last item with increasing coverage. The two are related in some situations - association plans would be a good insurance option that would allow for extremely large patient pools. Creating care co-ops/diagnosis pools funded with block grants for pre-existing conditions would be a good way to simultaneously reduce insurance costs (by removing pre-existing condition care costs from insurer's balance sheets), reduce total care costs (directly funding care of pre-existing conditions could likely be done much more efficiently than repeated ER visits/hospital admissions for crises), and solve coverage challenges (by providing a resource for care independent of insurance to people with pre-existing conditions).

There are a lot of options out there. The *real* challenge is probably making them politically palatable."

healthcare,"Well, you sound quite confident that they haven't been paid by the car insurance or been billed to your health insurance. You could possibly be billed for them as ultimately, the patient is always responsible for their bills UNLESS....if you gave the physical therapy your private health insurance and they were contracted with your insurance company and they failed to submit the claims  in a timely manner, then they would have to adjust those claims off, they would not be able to bill you due to an error on their part. Since the accident was still less than a year away, there's a possibility that your health insurance company has a timely filing period that would fit into their billing. I, personally, would go looking for them by simply asking the physical therapist's biller...what do you show as my balance on my account, either due by insurance or due by me? If they state $0, then consider yourself cleared, they've either been paid without you knowing or they've simply written them off. (For example, if your insurance company has a typical 90 days timely filing, and the filed after that timelimit and were told the claims were denied, they may have just written them off on their own accord.). If they state that there is a balance, then start questioning them, why? Why didn't you bill the auto insurance? Why didn't you bill the health insurance I provided to you? Etc, etc. Get to the bottom of it. 

There is no statute of limitations in billing a patient, I've personally billed patients from visits as far as 6 years ago (extenuating circumstances, but still, the money was owed and due.).

healthcare,"It may be Switzerland. Its not a single government payor system, but rather is similar to the ACA in the US. There is universal coverage due to very harsh penalties that make not buying insurance more expensive than buying it, so virtually everyone is covered. Switzerland also offers cutting edge care on par with what is available in the US, incredible access to all socioeconomic groups (including very low wait times), and excellent outcomes. Costs are pricey, but value proposition is good because outcomes and quality of care is so good. And it's still wayyyy cheaper than the US system at about 12% of GDP vs. 18+%. The biggest difference is that employers do not sponsor health insurance in switzerland, rather everybody buys a plan on the open market. Salaries are higher to compensate. Thus competition among insurers is strong and drives down costs. Additionally, all health insurance must be offered as non-profit for companies (unless you choose to buy-up and get supplemental policies). 

Healthcare in Switzerland is ideologically on par with the US, as far as not compromising on access and quality and being ok with higher costs. Additionally, as a relatively conservative European country, freedom of choice on insurance policies is greatly valued. That being said, while Switzerland does not have a fully socialized system and instead a managed competition system (similar to the ACA), it is subsidized by the government to ensure everybody has access and doesn't spend more than 8% of their annual income on healthcare.

healthcare,"You have had an income change when you go above the income limit in received income within a calendar month. So if it takes two paychecks to go over the limit, then you wait until after that second paycheck. Then you technically have 10 business days to report the change after that second pay check.  
And either way if you report it in June, you'll be covered to the end of June. If you can drag it out a little, usually until the 20th, you could likely get covered for all of July as well.  
So don't report it now, and see if it's possible to wait a bit if you're worried about the extra month in coverage.  
Also, if it will be a few months before your private insurance kicks in and you have kids, you can usually get gap coverage. But that's only for families. "
healthcare,"A single payer system is going to have utilization controls much more draconian than existing private payers.

The “Right to Try” debate is a good representation of the tensions on both sides. "
healthcare,"Medical providers become in-network providers due to an agreement between the provider and the ~~government~~ insurance company. Generally this means that the provider meets the standards the insurance company sets, is willing to follow the insurance company’s policy, and accepts the reimbursement rates the insurance company offers. Insurance companies want extensive networks (more providers), because this makes their coverage more competitive. If a provider cannot get in to a particular network, it means they did not come to an acceptable agreement with the insurance company, usually over policy or reimbursement disagreements. For example, the compensation might be below what the doctor feels is acceptable.

healthcare,"Please show me a reference for these major non-profit health insurers. Here's a random article via quick Google search displaying the ticker symbols for the most popular health insurers: https://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/top-5-largest-health-insurance-payers-in-the-united-states

Insurance companies of all sorts generally collect premiums and aim to break even or make relatively minor profits through their underwriting activities in order to compete for customers within their respective industries. They invest the revenues collected to make a bulk of their profit. Cigna as an example, reported $2.3b in net income for 2017. So, yes, they ultimately profited off of the illness of others, as they could have used the $2.3b in net income to offset premiums collected via their underwriting business or to expand coverage by increasing both the number of people they insure and the number of procedures they approve.

Big pharma and for-profit healthcare facilities are equally as guilty, inflating prices and putting unhealthy people into debt all while inflating the profits for the exclusive benefit of their shareholders.

Doctors, nurses, and even for-profit healthcare company executives deserve significant salaries in exchange for their expertise and skills, and again, a non-profits are able to provide high salaries commensurate with the value each individual brings to the entity.

The unnecessary part of the equation is taking the net income generated via healthcare related business operations and distributing it to shareholders, which is largely comprised of the top few percent of the already-wealthy and institutional investors (investment firms, banks, hedge funds).

Like I said, there are hundreds of industries where they can seek a return on investment, so why the hell do they feel the need to do so off of illness and death?

Car insurance companies use the same general insurance model of generating a majority of their profits by investing premiums to generate investment income. However, their premiums are being collected in order to cover the expenses of liability, collision, theft, and medical bills resulting from unpredictable auto accidents with hundreds of potential variables. It isn't the same as medical insurance, because their decisions don't directly determine life and death (transplant approval), and they're charging premiums so their customers avoid financial ruin due to an unpredictable event. If their insured is at fault, the opposing insurance company will receive payment from them; if the third party is at fault, they will pay their insured and then go after the at-fault person's insurance, with both insurance companies utilizing lawyers on retainer. It's all dictated by established civil and criminal law, along with police reports and witness statements. Someone being denied a life-saving transplant doesn't have much recourse against a giant corporation with hundreds of lawyers on retainer.

Finally, the CEO's of Amazon, FB, and the companies I've personally worked for aren't in the business of generating profits on life and death decisions. Therefore, rah-rah capitalism. But, as soon as Mark Zuckerburg has the capability to deny someone chemotherapy treatments, I'll be as equally as outraged about the evils of FB.

The rest of your text dedicated to going over various government services is irrelevant. Your argument is simply indefensible at a moral level. You can claim I don’t have the proper solution to fix our current situation and I’ll agree, as I’m not claiming to have a perfect solution. My point is the current profit motivation within our healthcare industry is simply wrong. I don't see a valid argument in favor of people making profits off of healthcare without significant aspects of greed and a lack of empathy.

I'm sure if every other highly industrialized nation out there can make socialized medicine work, we can eventually figure it out. Some countries experience extended wait times and doctors who are compensated less than US doctors, but since we have the highest national GDP in the world, we should be able to use that to offset less than ideal aspects compared to social healthcare found in other countries.

Again, it comes down to greed. If I were fortunate enough to be a billionaire (which is largely based on benefiting from the right circumstances and time, as stated by Bezos, Gates, and Musk), I wouldn't give a shit about higher taxes as long as it helped my fellow citizens live longer healthier lives. Oh no, I might have to get rid of my third helicopter and sixth vacation home; it's the end of the world."

And we're almost there, that post was 90&amp;#37; attacking me! One could probably argue for 100&amp;#37;!

You argued that the German system was ""just like"" the US system. Then, when I brought up that the German system was funded 85&amp;#37; by the government and that it's very much more similar to the Canadian system, you started poking holes in the German system? Am I right so far? Then you implied that the German system was going to fail by saying ""the money will run out soon"".

So which is it? Is the German system like the US system, or is it like the Canadian system? Is the German system good or not? You said that the ER was filled with smokers, but then said it's just like the US system? Pretend I'm dumb and lay out your argument, in a very clear, concise manner for me. At least then I can shoot it down with relative ease. It's hard trying to put your wishy\-washy perspective into a coherent argument, but I'm doing my best. "
healthcare,"The fact that so many companies need to make separate agreements with hospitals, doctors, prescription drug companies leads to high overhead... overhead for Private insurance companies is 10-15%, Medicare is 2% overhead.  Then factor in that these companies need profit vs medicare.  Then add on that we can’t negotiate as a monopoly for better drug prices.  Then also more is profit driven, so makes sense to run more tests to be sure and make the extra money.  Also so many people still don’t have insurance so they get no preventative care and get worked on at hospital where it costs the most to get treated.

Flying with a damaged ear (due to a gnarly infection) is, for me, agonising. Definitely check with a doctor.

Worth a shot), doing the ear popping thing every few seconds.

It is going to take time. 

If you are going to a large institution with name recognition you could seek administrative fellowships at your hospital, that will shorten your timeline. They are 2-3 years, pay poorly, but  get you in with the c-suite early. Regardless you still will have to grind it  out and build a reputation for doing great work. The work is first importance, the degree is secondary.  Don't get stuck in one role or area of exposure either, you would be surprised how valuable having a breadth of experience can be. 

Ultimately, when you are done you have to choose what you care about, identify your goals, and start to take action to make them a reality before your loans come  on out of deferment.

The medical insurance provider makes the prescription coverage provider seem nice and enjoyable to work with. I've never been told that I don't have a right to question their payment practices (after they paid $70 on a $7,800 covered procedure with an in network doctor, rather than the 80% they're supposed to pay). I've even provided proof that the hospital system is double dipping, and was told ""that sounds like a personal problem"". Wat.

healthcare,"Healthcare in America is very complicated because it has so many ties to political parties and big pharmaceutical companies who are making billions off of this broken system.

We just cannot do it because the solution involves all these companies making bank to go into a big loss. Its the sad truth but because of their political influence, big companies are literally capitalizing on the misery of Americans.

Moreover, Medicare and medicaid beneficiaries are not 100% covered most of the times. Even they are paying out of pocket despite the government picking up tge bill. Worse yet, the medicare and medicaid money is running out for the future generations because the population is increasing and things are getting more and more expensive but salaries are the same.

Kaiser will have to return most of the February payment, if they got it \(which for some reason, I can't confirm through anybody\) once HHS sends the letter that I requested. 

The answer about what to do with insurance companies being obtuse over ACA issues is go straight to the feds because if you keep making your case, they'll just terminate your website access.

If the insurance company says you don't exist then you need to be asking them why. If this is the first time you've ever used your insurance then it's possible you're coverage was denied and you missed the letter.

There is no single ""solution"" because that is not how the world works. It is psychologically satisfying to talk about single problems and single solutions (""costs are too high and the government could price control them"") because these sound bites are easy to understand for people who are too overwhelmed by the actual complexity of the problem. Unfortunately, this type of action gets you into trouble (""We're going to adapt the MA Romneycare model to every state!"") because the US is truly diverse and people interact with Federal rules in different ways, producing vastly different outcomes by region.

The real-world approach is to keep chipping away at identifiable problem areas, usually by smaller moves, and look for improvement over the course of a few decades."

healthcare,"your true colors are now flying.  just to clarify, are they just blue or black and red? "
healthcare,"1. I understand how denied claims occur. My question is in reference to WHY they occur. Why do insurance providers deny claims? If it’s in their interest to pay as many bills as possible or as this article states pay as much as possible for a bill, then why do they employ armies of employees for utilization management and customer service to explain to members why they are denying claims? 

2. So your suggesting that analytics is growing but is implicitly being handicapped to not be to helpful. They are attempting to find ways to help make a profit but don’t want to drive down costs? 

3. Question isn’t about difficulty with scale. If profit margins drive insurance companies, shouldn’t non-profits be incentivized to maintain the lowest medical costs possible, which would lower their premiums and provide a competitive advantage?

4. So the worse performing insurers buy better performing insurers so that they can further increase rates?

5. How do auditors that find improper billing and detect fraud drive up costs? A lot of vendors are paid a % of savings....which means they have zero cost if the alternative is not going after those claims. 

6.  Not sure what you are saying here. 

You’ll have to try harder then that. The article has a very clear hypothesis, which you completely ignored when responding to my questions. 

My question is this: if insurers are so concerned with “growing their pie”, which is done by spending more money to justify higher premiums, then why do they put so much effort into reducing spend in other ways then overpaying for claims?"
healthcare,"The way it is currently, it is entirely up to the you, the patient, to keep track of personal health information. Typically, the ""keeper"" of health information in a family unit is the mother figure. (Of course, this isn't always true.)

To see a provider -- whether it be primary care or dental care -- you do NOT need to bring your medical history. He/She will ask you questions to get them up to speed. If you don't know your health history, be honest and tell them so.

One thing that may be important for you to locate, however, is your immunizations card. This is often helpful if you ever want to travel abroad (to a country that requires additional vaccinations) or work in a clinical setting. Some employers, like universities, may ask for this too. Don't fret if it's gone. There are ways to do blood tests called titers to see if you have indicators of vaccination or exposure."

healthcare,"Hospitals aren't some dastardly evil entity out to screw people over.  Balancing margin and mission is infinitely difficult in a heath care environment and has been characterized in hyperbolic fashion for political gain.

Fees for service are no longer the revenue model for hospitals.  We can no longer have well-insured patients eat the costs of the uninsured with unnecessary tests, scans and procedures that will automatically be re-imbursed with pre-authorization.  Value based care is the new model and that means normalizing fee schedules (RVU's) across payors/provifers, which is more complicated than any one knows (who knew healthcare was so complicated). Ask any hospital chargemaster how they determine costs and I doubt you'll find an industry standard that isn't largely based upon medicare reimbursement rates.

Most hospitals don't even know how to define their costs... How can they know if they're offering great care at the lowest price?  Thankfully, EMR's are making it possible to measure costs vs outcomes (EBM evidence based medicine) to truly determine ""value"" to the customer/patient.  The Harvard business journal has some great articles to this point.

Healthcare professionals have rejected the commercialization of their industry.  Biz professionals can't apply biz ethics (or the lack there of) to patient care because it's not making widgets.  But this was an industry-wide, lazy-out to placate provider egos vs addressing patient centered care at cost.  Wouldn't you pay the most for the ones you love?  But paying more doesn't mean getting the best care and we shouldn't be guilting patients into paying more without due diligence of researching actual EBM outcomes.

A good physician provides the best possible care but a great physician provides care the patient can afford and we're slowly building the resources throughout the healthcare industry to build the infrastructure needed to achieve that end.  "

I think you're having a hard time utilizing critical thinking skills. 

1. Physicians went to school 12 years to make their salary. Their money is their money...period. Stop assuming to know how much they get, how often they work, or what interest rates they have in their finances.

2. Sharpen your skill and realize that the system is static because, it is not changing fundamentally. Insurance prices are an externality of static markets.

3. Were not discussing the military or the fact that the US protects a majority of the world. Canada only gets to live so freely BECAUSE of the US military.

4. You can call anything a basic human right. Medicine is a business everywhere in the world. The law of supply and demand is not excluded because of sympathy. If it were easy to become a doctor, then the cost of healthcare would be pennies. I am going to go on a limb and assume you are NOT a physician. Why not? Why not be a physician and make these big bucks you're ranting about? Oh.....that's right.....because it's a grueling arduous process. This is possibly the reason

If they are in network, call your insurance and ask them if you are responsible for the bill if you provided your insurance to an in network doctor and they refuse to send a claim. Generally the answer is no. The doctor will end up dealing with timely filing deadlines. That isn’t your problem.

This isn't leading to the breakdown of anything. It's keeping it static. Insurance is the demise of healthcare. 
All you have to do is think about grocery shopping. What if.....you couldn't just buy your vegetables from the market. What if you had to pay money every month to a broker, who then allowed you to vegetables from that same market, but you had to at least pay a 20 dollar copay each time. You had to send money to the broker. They had to negotiate prices with the market. The grocer had to submit claims for what you bought. And then the broker had to analyze the claims and submit payment. Do you see how many extra salaries are involved? The price would go up because all those extra salaries have to be paid.

You are being stubborn thinking that creating more middlemen lowers the price of healthcare.

Yes. You CAN get a discount paying out of pocket. 2/3 of the cost of healthcare is administration!!!  If a doc doesn't have to pay for a billet and wait months for payments and spend thousands on software and IT, the price is lower!

It does not cost 5k to go to your physician. There is not one single physician who charges 5k for a visit. You're thinking of PROCEDURES! And I don't think it will take 10 years to pay off 5k. That's ludicrous. 

I'm sorry you're not good with numbers, but 10k for a hospital procedure does not equal 10k for a physician. 

Stop.....just stop......THINK about this....

Who gets paid from that 10k? Renting the operating room. The nurses. The anesthesia. The anesthesiologist. The check in staff. The nurse anesthesiologist. The nurse in triage. The janitor. The electricity. The elevator repair. All of the cleaning supplies. The billing people. The checkout people. THEN at the physicians private office, the billers, the overhead. The list is monumental! Think!!!!!!!!

So the physician gets a tiny slice of the pie. Then, the physician has to buy health insurance, mortgage, malpractice insurance, licensing, dea licensing, CME, utilities and after a long long list of expenses that EVERYONE has, the student loan. It's called cost allocation.

To think that a physician just gets 100% of 10k and has no expenses is just silly nonsense.

I have talked with people in other countries. My daughter was just in the hospital in Germany a week ago. No, not everyone loves their healthcare system.

Hmmmmm......they love their healthcare, yet.....they......went......to.....another......country......
Anecdotal confirmation bias much?

And finally......YES! That was my point! Insurance has destroyed healthcare. Thank you for agreeing! But.....you know.:....universal healthcare is still insurance. Yes.....it's true.....Canada spends too much on healthcare. Instead of private party insurance you have the government taking that role. I don't know about you,  but the thought of the government wisely spending money...????....ah....no.

Double check with your therapist and ask his/her billing person to help you in determining what the notes are stating that is not showing the insurance company improvement.

If you don’t like the Milliman Group or believe them to be a corporate partisan stooge, then you do not know healthcare. Milliman is a independent actuary analysis company that does most healthcare analysis for any large legislative reform or proposal. Most states that used a state based exchange for the ACA used Milliman studies to research cost performance and actuarial data. 

Would you accept the same Milliman report issued by the Society of Actuaries that puts the number at 5.1%

To say that tax enforcement and collection should not be counted as direct cost because they are already collecting the tax is like saying McDonald’s already has fryer’s, they should just give the French fries away for free. No their is a substantive cost when you have to both enforce business payroll tax withholding, collect funds monthly or quarterly, balance reported business and personal tax filings, audit business with misreported or questionable statements, issue guidance for regulatory changes and prosecute in coordination with the DOJ unlawful behavior.

I’m glad you read the study. I don’t disagree that Medicare Drug negotiating would help control future medical cost inflation but it would also hurt the domestic bio pharmaceutical industry, of which the US is responsible for 70% of the world innovation. There are no easy answers.

healthcare,"Honestly - I don't think it's ALL political. I think it's society. The market is responding to what Americans say that they want. IMO even if we got single payer - as soon as people realized that they had the same thing as people that they looked down on they'd look to the private market for top tier insurance or replacement plans. Play this out over time and we're pretty damn near the ACA - the poor covered by medicaid, private insurance for middle and upper classes, medicare for the elderly, disabled, and people with kidney disease, and military based coverage for vets and their families. The huge cost is uncompensated care. The way in which it's political I suppose is that republicans wrecked the ACA - just like they'd dismantle single payer if given the chance. But the fact remains that Americans don't want what their neighbor has. They want better. "

healthcare,"Switch to vaping. I know you've heard that line before, but I have some additional info for you that you might not have heard before (and which might convince you to switch).

A lot of smokers have tried vaping and just couldn't make the switch because (a) it doesn't give a good throat hit usually, but when it does it's *Too* harsh on the throat, and/or (b) it just doesn't feel the same. Vaping is different from smoking because of the type of nicotine used. Freebase nicotine is in vaping, while organic nicotine salts are in tobacco. Freebase nicotine is very harsh and it stings your mouth (which you'll know if you ever tried the gum), and more importantly it doesn't hit you instantly the way smoking does. That's because freebase nicotine can take 30 to 60 seconds to be absorbed into your bloodstream, while cigarette smoke is absorbed almost instantly. **that instant ""hit"" is where the best stress relief comes from, and it's why a lot of smokers won't switch**. Vaping doesn't provide the same level of stress reduction as quickly.

Well about a year ago a new e-cig juice came into town that uses the same organic salts (organic in the chemical sense, not the farming sense) that are found in tobacco.

These e-cigs give a good throat hit like a cigarette, don't burn your throat, and hit instantly like a cigarette, without the cancerous smoke. If you've tried switching before but couldn't do it, give vaping another try and pick up some nicotine salt liquid this time.

Search for JUUL, or pick up any regular vape pen/ecig/mod and buy ""nic salt"" e-liquid instead of the regular stuff.

Honestly the fruits and vegetables stuff isn't going to do a damn thing to cover up the fact that you're smoking. You need to quit.

EDIT: I've been saying for a while that nic salts are the thing that will finally convince smokers to switch. I switched 4 years ago and never looked back but I personally know people who still smoke because vaping wasn't right for them. Please prove me right."

4) But for the system to work, 2 needs enough power to pull against 1 and 2 only has that power when there are multiple 1 in a given market to choose from. 

5) (other than plastic surgery) healthcare is a system devoid of choices. Most Americans get the choice dictated by their employer (unless a spouse gives a second), and most of the rest get whichever government program they qualify for. 

6) when it’s time to use that insurance, 911 brings a single ambulance and even self drive leads to a single hospital. Being more proactive, most plans have a limited GP list that will give referrals to single (approved) specialists. Few of the choices 2 needs to make a functioning market. 

7) private healthcare leaves customers with little power so the rope is slack (inefficient). Its also focused on healthy people between 20 and 60, so it leaves huge swathes of the country (including people who spent 40-50 years paying into the private system) uncovered. So we end spending as much public money covering people as if we’d just had a single public system in the first place. "

Despite decades of scans showing irreparable spinal damage, she has spent months getting nowhere on obtaining the original dosage her doctor agreed upon through years trial and error. As a result, she's been unable to leave the house for ANY leisurely activity since the insurance company began playing doctor. How this is legal, I have no idea. An insurance company doctor, who has literally never seen my mother as a patient, has more authority than the doctor treating her and seeing her on a monthly basis for the past two decades.

healthcare,"Your instincts are good, your friend’s statement is inaccurate.

Premiums are not based on any measure of wealth.  Premium subsidies on the exchanges are based on income alone - the value of other assets like a house has 0 effect on them. If your friend’s parents had no income, they would have large subsidies.

The Kaiser family foundation (a non-partisan healthcare research organization) has a calculator you can use to determine estimated premiums and subsidies, as well as see what factors go into them: https://www.kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/

A few other notes:
- it is very unlikely your friends parents have premiums that high, but if they do it means they have too high an income to qualify for subsidies (or they did not give the exchange accurate information on their income). Unfortunately these people are currently the collateral damage of some political gamesmanship - President Trump cut cost sharing subsidy payments (to cover copays, etc - different from premium subsidies) to insurance companies, and in response they increased premiums. Those who get premiums subsidies saw those subsidies increase by the same amount, but middle class folks who do not qualify for subsidies are paying the full amount of the increase. The president did this as a negotiating tactic, but when the gambit failed he chose to stick with it rather than returning the subsidies and lowering premiums, I assume in hopes of getting something from Democrats in exchange for returning the subsidies. Until that happens or the President backs down, middle class people on the exchanges suffer.
- Your friend’s parents also sound older, which means they are charged higher premiums than younger people (this is called age rating). The ACA limited this practice but it is still legal within some confines
- The $6,500 annual limit is on out of pocket cost sharing (copay, deductible, etc), it does not include premiums. 
- You can go on Texas’s exchange yourself and look at the available plans and premiums (you could even ask your friend which plan her parents have and check it out)

Good on your for being skeptical and using your own judgement when someone tried to tell you something that smelled wrong. A lot of people would have just taken it at face value."
healthcare,"Isn’t this the crux of the argument. It is not a apples to apples comparison when trying to compare Medicare admin rates to private insurance admin rates. In order to make a fair analysis, you have to compare all cost variable and fixed to private insurance admin rates. You have to compare total “public” resources  to its “private” competitor. The argument that somehow Medicare admin is so vastly more efficient than private insurance is again, not making a apples to apples comparison. Again, when you do, you will see that the total comparable cost 5.1% Medicare to 5.6% United Health Care (private insurance), the huge (billions) of purported savings no longer exist. 

So the next whale to discuss is how much of savings will we see with the Medicare reimbursement rates (fee schedule). 

I am a advocate of universal healthcare but I am not someone who advocates throwing the proverbial “baby out with the bath water.” The easy and often political argument is to blame one sector with the solution relying on a easy answer. Get rid of greedy insurers or get rid of private drug companies. These answers reek of political solutions that rarely/never rely on a sustainable comprehensive economic models or analysis. 

We have to be critical of spending models that do not effectively look at total cost variables when trying new approaches to healthcare. Does Medicare for all sound like a great plan, YES! What would it take both in economic GDP loss, economic hardship and public savings to have comprehensive universal coverage? There are no easy solutions.

We can, in my professional opinion have the best of both. Using legacy systems like private insurance, private business and private practice while providing universal healthcare and more efficient markets.

I think the root of your problem here is not ""our healthcare system"" or your insurance... I think your doctor's office doesn't know how to bill properly.  I've worked in the billing field for a while, when someone doesn't know what they are doing they usually fling a bunch of charges against the wall to see what sticks, they take what gets denied and try changing it (usually don't know what they're doing so they mess it up further) then they bill the patient when the insurance doesn't pay.

healthcare,"Option 2 could be better. Over the course of the year you are saving $1,200 in premium costs, but depending on how often you seek psych services,  the plans contracted amount, and your copay amount you could save. Say their average rate is $200 per service/visit and you have a monthly appointment. Assuming no copays.

Option 1: premium ~$2,400 (12x200) per year. Services = lessor of $2,400 (200x12) or $1000. $3,400 per year expense.

Option 2: premium = $1,200 (12×100) per year. Services = lessor of $2,400 (200x12) or $3,500. $3,600 per year expense.

Play with the numbers to fit it to your life circumstances. But bottom line is If you use services frequently, go with a plan with less out of pocket.  Otherwise high deductible is fine. Also... call United and ask what the average cost is for a psych visit of the type you need.

My guess is that you are looking at a more comprehensive ""Medicare"" for all where the tax payor pays a portion of taxable earnings and will never see a medical bill. We can base it on recent studies or my favorite is the Judy Liu and non partisan Rand studies that show we are looking at anywhere from a 17% tax increase for comprehensive coverage.

In any case, I unfortunately don't have a lot of good advice to offer. Obviously, the ""easiest"" thing to do would be to shop around for a new therapist (I do recognize how unhelpful that advice is). You might get UHC to make an exemption in your case if you can demonstrate that you should stay with your current therapist. This could be done by getting a specifically written referral by your primary care doctor who is in network. It's a long shot, and would require extra work by you and your doctor (and possibly your therapist) but it *can* happen. Barring that, the only other thing I can recommend is working with your therapist to come up with an alternate compensation arrangement. For example, maybe you can do shorter or less frequent sessions, which would bring the overall cost down to where you can afford it. It's not ideal, but it may be your only option."
healthcare,"Medicare numbers are not standard when issued by the MAB and even the consensus with healthcare economist will say that the medicare admin rates are a Myth as published.

Also you are using faulty rates of valuation as not understanding cost denominator. Medicare members admin median cost is far higher than that of private insurance even with the Medicare Rate Structure.  If you have 1,000,000 members with a net admin rate of 5% and a total cost of $10,000 P/M is not the same as 300,000 members with a 10% admin rate and a total cost of $7,000 P/M (9.1% is the national average for private insurance 2016).

So other useful documents would be anything stating when your employment begins/ends and pay stubs.

Are there any retina specialists in your plan network at all?  If not then you could appeal the insurance company's denial to cover services.

My parents were purchasing a plan off the exchange for ~$1,200 per month with a $12K deductible for 5 people.  When my mom started working for the city last year, they were able to get a plan for ~$200 per month with a $1K deductible.   

My personal plan is $70 per month through my employer.  Working for a very small company will not land you benefits like this as they won't have as large of a risk-pool."

healthcare,"You would think, but you can't visualize a physicians job as a normal one. Physicians already work 80 hours a week, but only get paid for 40. On average, when you visit your doctor, they are getting paid for 7.5 of talking with you. Then they get paid 7.5 minutes to write your visit in the chart. This last part is extremely time consuming as there is form after form that needs to be checked. So, imagine having 45 minutes of work, if you wanted to do ""quality"" and only getting paid for 15 minutes. Every time you use a healthcare ""portal"" the doctor is required by law to check it and they do not get paid for it. Every time you call to ask for a prescription refill, the doctor does not get paid, yet is required to handle it. When you get land done, the doctor is required to check them and get back to you if they are important.....not paid for. Every time you email the doc.........not paid for.

The system is destroying healthcare. The government want to make everyone healthy. The insurance companies want everyone to go to the doc as few times as possible. The patients want to be seen for everything possible, yet not have to pay for it. 

Everyone has expectations of the doctor, but they DONT WANT TO PAY FOR IT!

Think about your auto. If you take you car in for an oil change, should you be able to say, ""Oh....since I'm here....can I get a transmission flush, and new tires, and new spark plugs......but I'd don't want to pay for it.""?

Remember that next time you visit the physician. They are only getting paid for 7.5 minutes with you. Keep your appointment limited to ONE thing. Show up early. And don't talk more than 7.5 minutes. Anything else and the doc is spending money on you.

Right now a majority of doctors are burned out. Ready to quit. Hate their job. Suicide for female family medicine physicians is higher than any other industry. As many as an entire medical school of physicians commit suicide EACH year! We are approaching a 100k physician shortage in 2 years. The only answer they have come up with is to let nurses take care of patients instead. Nurses have no where near the hours of training that physicians have.

This is all because of insurance. For every patient it takes about 3 administrative people. 2/3 of the money in healthcare is because of administration. Billets, coders, claims review,etc....... All of this is to handle insurance. It will be the same with a ONE PAYER SYSTEM, the only difference will be that the government will be doing all the paperwork. I don't k ow if you enjoy the government workers at the DMV, but this is what medicine will be under a single payer healthcare system.

I'm not sure what you mean by self-funded. That would mean you pay for everything. Possibly you mean a high deductible health savings account?


If insurance were eliminated, the price would go waaaaaayyyyyyyy down. An MRI at a hospital is a couple grand. Without insurance it would be a couple hundred. The average doc appointment would be like 50 dollars. But Americans have a hard time saving money when there's iPhones and Netflix to buy, so they would rather pay 100 dollars a month + 5000 dollar deductibles, rather than save money for a 50 dollar doc visit."

healthcare,"Unless the hospital/provider is specifically serving a low income or elderly population (medicare/medicaid), the majority of patients are going to be through the group/individual market with negotiated fee schedules from insurers.

healthcare,"That's just it, there should be no break in healthcare coverage for anyone to worry about.  Losing a job and trying to find another one is stressful enough w/o having to navigate healthcare too, especially when managing a health issue.

If we can get to single payer you get healthcare when you need it just because you're a human being, not because you have a certain job, are rich enough or other reasons why some have it and some don't.  Keeping it tied to certain jobs keeps many people under control of their employer and afraid to speak up for better pay, change jobs, reduce hours, start a business, etc.  Fewer jobs offer insurance, the plans they do offer are getting worse and no job or benefit is guaranteed.  We would all be more secure and have more potential for work/life balance with a single payer system.

Most people who have insurance now will pay less per year compared to their current premiums and out of pocket costs and no more medical bankruptcies.  I know we can do it at least as well as any other country if we get past the obstruction, sabotage and lies coming from the opposition.  Seems like the opposition boils down to profits for big business, people who fear others having the same access to healthcare they do and fear of unemployed people getting healthcare.  The truth is more people than ever will be contributing to the fund since all the jobs that currently don't have insurance will be included and pay a tax just like they do for medicare and social security.  Also, more people will be able to work when they get the healthcare they need and break the cycle some are stuck in, health problem/lose job/poverty."

healthcare,"Of course we must pay higher taxes for more services. We already do pay more to private insurers in the form of co-pays, co-insurance, premiums, and other out-of-pocket expenses not deemed usual, customary, and reasonable — we just don’t call them taxes.

Now, how is it that other developed countries with single-payer systems cost less per person on average than the United States? Medicare is expensive because it covers an already sick group of people no private insurer would cover without heavy subsidies, and it’s been handicapped with an inability to negotiate drug prices, but it’s still the most efficient program we have in America outside the V.A. Administrative costs are in the single-digit percentage points and have a greater percentage of revenues going towards actual healthcare without added costs, like marketing and shareholder returns.

Taxes should no longer be a four-letter word in the U.S. We have to come to terms with the proven fact that government-run services like Medicare and Social Security can do better than private programs and cost much less too. It’s no wonder these programs sometimes underperform when we starve them of funding."
healthcare,"Ok. First off. Germany's funds are not just paid for by the government. They are put in to non-profit orgs to manage insurance.

Second, 10% of your income is approximately how much you are paying for your healthcare in Canada. You are not getting ""free"" healthcare. Stop spewing garbage.

There's nothing wrong with private insurance, besides the fact that they are evil greedy bastards. The US chooses to have evil greedy corporations pay for a bulk of private insurance so that taxpayers don't have to. What's wrong with that? You'd rather make citizens pay and let corporations expend human capital with no consequence? The indigent and disabled are still cared for, and our number one flaw is those that make too much for Medicaid, but don't have employers that subsidize. You're going off the handle talking gibberish about me choosing one over the other.

Canada has universal insurance that you PAY for. It's not free!

At very least the chart title is misleading and all it says is we spend more keeping people over 74 alive, and for each year they get older we spend more money than other countries.  This chart doesn't show that our life expectancy is lagging behind while our healthcare prices go up, it's showing that we're less efficient at increasing our life expectancy to how much it costs.

healthcare,"
I'm not sure why you assume single payor would be like the VA model which has a fixed budget set every 3-5 yrs.  Medicare (governed by physicians/technologists) is a more appropriate example of what single payor would look like.  Medicare reimbursement rates are based on the patient outcomes/satisfaction, which incentivizes providers to utilize evidence based medicine and technology improvements that result in better patient care.  Medicare benchmarks costs and outcomes, which provides measures that will allow us to effectively gauge performance and identify legitimate innovation.  

It's much more likely that Medicare will be expanded to cover all patients.  Hospitals will no longer have to negotiate extreme costs of meds as individual buyers in a market and can finally acheive massive economies of scale savings with single payor purchases.  Insurance Payors will be co-opted to assist in handling the increase in patient coverage to Medicare in order to minimize the disruption to the economy (thousands of insurance company employees suddenly unemployed).

The US does not have the greatest healthcare in the world if you measure by outcomes of all Americans and not just the rich alone, but does have the most expensive system.  We're much bigger, spread out  and demographically diverse than when compared to other countries with socialized medicine.  We don't help ourselves with the redundancies and self inflicted inefficiencies with a network of quasi connected islands.  

MBA's may be clueless about healthcare but there is an amazing vacuum in physician leadership that is effectively capable of managing the Mission with the Margin.  People with medical know how and executive leadership skills are a rare resource.  In the end it will take both, physicians and administrators, working together to provide the best possible care for all Americans."

healthcare,"You've talked yourself into a circular argument. Hospitals charge a lot because people can't afford to pay \-\&gt;  insurance is super expensive because hospitals charge a lot \-\&gt; people can't afford insurance \-\&gt; people don't pay hospital bills because hospitals charge a lot and they don't have insurance\-\&gt; hospitals charge more because of the people who can't pay

Do you not see how this is leading to a breakdown of healthcare in general? The more expensive healthcare gets, the fewer people that can afford it, the more expensive healthcare has to get to be able to cover the people who can't afford it....

So by being stubborn and saying ""I don't want to pay for poor people's healthcare"" people who CAN afford to pay taxes and their own healthcare are actually more and more paying for poor people's healthcare.

So whether you like it or not, you're paying for poor people's healthcare. \(Assuming you can afford you own.\)

I think you're wrong by saying ""if you have no insurance and walk into a clinic."" Sure, you may EVENTUALLY get it down to that price \(and even that I still doubt\), but only after being given a bill for $5000, calling 4 different people and saying ""hey look, I make no money and there's no way I can afford this."" and then subsequently failing the payments they set up for you for the next 10 years. \(Prove me wrong.\)

You say healthcare sucks everywhere, but most other country's people love their healthcare. Ask anybody in canada. Ask people in germany, the whole of europe. It's actually funny if you ask someone here in canada, they look at you as if you're crazy. Like ""why is this person asking about healthcare"" as if they've never given it a thought in their life. It's just there, no one worries about it, no one stresses about it. No one is afraid to go into debt if they go to the hospital. You say that ""healthcare sucks everywhere"" but I highly doubt you've actually experienced the healthcare system anywhere else than your own country.

And then you're justifying high prices in the US by saying ""Med school students have 250k in debt."" Ha. Welcome to the club. And when charging $10000 an hour to be in the ER \(extrapolating from my $5000 bill after 80&amp;#37; coinsurance when I spent 4\-5 hours in the ER\), I'd guess that debt goes away pretty quickly.

You say the cost is mainly due to insurance, so why not get rid of the insurance and get rid of that cost? Then we'd save 2/3 of the price every time. And then insurance would be an option, not a requirement.

Get rid of insurance and insurance companies \-\&gt; prices come down \-\&gt; normal people can afford to pay for healthcare \-\&gt; rich people pay less for normal people \-\&gt; everyone wins?

It honestly sounds like you're an American using any excuse to say ""Canada's healthcare system sucks"" when people with Canada's healthcare system are really saying ""Actually no it doesn't."" Either that or you're a rich Canadian sick of paying ""higher"" taxes. "

6. Why are insurers experimenting with alternative payment models?


Additionally:
Yes, the more expensive healthcare is the more people will “need” health insurance but there are diminishing returns associated with “self-insuring” through no obtaining insurance.

You've started attacking me, ignoring any actual arguments I've made, and have come up with multiple strawmen so that you can ""win"" your own arguments.

It's really funny to watch this happen. Let me do the honorable thing and respond, directly, to your ""arguments."" I only ask you to show me the same courtesy.

1. This is a non argument. Were you trying to make a point? Are you trying to get me to feel sympathy for some of the best paid people in the country? Physicans make a crap ton of money and they can easily pay off their student loans. I can guarantee you that.
2. An attack on me, how original. Even though insurance is the currency of the market of healthcare, it is somehow... external to that market? Can you better explain this? Yes, the healthcare market IS changing fundamentally. Ask your local doctor about their insurance premiums over the last decade, ask them if their practices have changed because of healthcare. Personally, I think it's extraordinarily naive to assume the healthcare market is EVER static. 
3. The US military protects the world from.... what exactly? When's the last time an external threat has hurt the US? Go ahead and ask the people of the occupied countries if they want the US to be there. Isn't the UN the actual ""world police?"" Is that not what it was made for? 
4. Let's take a quote from the declaration of independence. ""We hold these truths to be sacred &amp; undeniable; that all men are created equal &amp; independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent &amp; inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, &amp; liberty, &amp; the pursuit of happiness"" Does healthcare not fall under the ""preservation of life"" and/or ""the pursuit of happiness"" clause of that statement? The US is one of an ever shrinking list of countries that does not have socialized healthcare. Most of AFRICA has socialized healthcare. Just pointing that out. Funnily enough, I know exactly of this ""grueling"" process of schooling. For, you see, I am a doctor. Not a medical doctor, but a PhD. 
5. So you want to get rid of insurance companies. Great! What's your solution for providing healthcare to those who can't afford it then? What of those who are extraordinarily sick? Those with cancer? What of those who only get insurance through their job and otherwise wouldn't be able to afford it? That's great, we agree on getting rid of insurance companies. I, however, have thought past that and moved onto a better solution. Have you? What, exactly, IS your solution? Pay cash for everything? Because you haven't actually stated it, and have left me to make assumptions, which you are likely going to attack me for next. 
6. I never said it would be cheaper for the US to adopt a similar system. I'm not sure why this is an argument. But I suppose I should respond in kind. The number of people living in the US who do not have health insurance is around 10%, down from 16% since Obamacare was in acted. That's ~30 million people. And that doesn't even include elderly people.

So please. If you're done attacking me, please pay me a courtesy and actually respond to my arguments. I'll ask this again....

You said your daughter went to the ER in Germany. Did she get treated well? Did she have any issues? Did she end up with a large bill? Was the process stressful for her other than the actual injury/illness? Now, if you could, for 10 seconds, put yourself in someone else's shoes. The parent of a German girl who is visiting the US. Imagine the same thing happened to her, how do you think it would have been different? How would you have felt then about the US healthcare system? Funnily enough, I know how this story ends. I'm friends with a foreign girl in the US who needed surgery and found it cheaper to fly home across the Atlantic, get the procedure done, then fly back a month later after she had recovered. "
healthcare,"Wow.

Falling further and further into the hole you dug yourself. Ignoring everything that directly contradicts everything you've said, and even doubling down on the ""attacking me"" quota.

Luckily, my skin is thicker than yours and I have no need to resort to personal attacks to win the argument, as my arguments are rooted in reason and logic, made clear by the complete lack of retort on your part. 

Let me point out a DIRECT example of you ignoring any argument that you can't defend against. I brought up the quote from the declaration of independence. ""We hold these truths to be sacred &amp; undeniable; that all men are created equal &amp; independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent &amp; inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, &amp; liberty, &amp; the pursuit of happiness""

Which CLEARLY states that the RIGHT to the ""preservation of life"" is given to all people. Yet you chose to ignore that and create a strawman saying ""The government should give away free cars because it makes me happy."" Let me help you understand what that means.

http://www.softschools.com/examples/fallacies/straw_man_examples/496/

Here is an explanation aimed at elementary and middle school students. I implore you to read it and realize the error of your ways. 

But please, continue. I find it interesting to collect textual examples of people who are so devout in their belief that they refuse to see evidence to the contrary, and even further refuse to perhaps amend their views when confronted with a reasonable argument against their echo chambered ideas. 

I'm going to ask this a third time, before we get too off topic.

How was your daughter's ER visit in Germany? Was it good? Did she end up with a large bill when she was done? Was it stressful other than the illness/injury itself? Did she worry about going into debt because of it? Is she ok now? Was the care adequate?

healthcare,"You obviously don't know how German insurance works.

It's an employee/employer match.

Their ""social insurance"" is the employment based insurance. 

The rest is self bought private insurance. 

Once you choose, your stuck.


Edit: and future trends are following the models of the rest of the world. Costs keep going up up up. It will be unsustainable in the future, JUST LIKE US and CANADA!!!!!!!


Ok. I can see your googling all you can in a hurry to make a snarky comment. This is the data I work with daily. I can argue off the top of my head for days need be. It's my field to solve the worlds healthcare crisis, and just like is said in my first post.....I in no way mean to suggest that Canada's healthcare is inferior. Healthcare in EVERY country is on a path to doom. There is no answer. Anyone who suggests there is or claims countries have ""free""care is just prolonging the public be confused. Economies of scale are in place and the law of diminishing returns are far traversed."
healthcare,"FINALLY! You stopped attacking me for a second to write something comprehensible! Yet still wrong unfortunately.

The healthcare IS free. As in I don't pay for it out of pocket when I need it. It is collected in general taxes and paid for by the government. Sorta like saying that the roads outside your house are free, or the massive aircraft carriers the US has are free. Of course, nothing is free. The difference here is that I have to pay regardless. The money is not mine, it is the government's from taxes. It never was mine. The really funny thing is that you're paying just as much, yet also paying healthcare on top of that, while not getting any benefit. Don't believe me? Let's look at the spending of the US for 2016.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_States\_federal\_budget#/media/File:CBO\_Infographic\_2016.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget#/media/File:CBO_Infographic_2016.png)

Number 1 is military. Number 2 is stuff including ""health"", number 3 is assistance programs, and number 4 and 5 are medicare and Medicaid. Without looking at the numbers, I'd say that \~35&amp;#37; of that chart is medical related stuff. So 35&amp;#37; of your taxes are going to healthcare, even though you're not benefiting from it. So sure, Canada's healthcare isn't ""free"" but at least it's not as bad as paying for healthcare you're not getting. At least I can ""dip into"" the pool I've paid into via taxes. You have to pay insurance premiums ON TOP OF that 35&amp;#37;. Let's do a very quick calculation. Assuming you make 50,000. I don't feel like looking it up, but I think it's probably around a 33&amp;#37;\(EDIT 22&amp;#37; with new 2018 tax law\) tax bracket. \(EDIT Because I did look it up\) So you pay 16500 \(11000\) in taxes. $5775 \(3850\) of that is into ""health"" related programs the US government provides. Then, on TOP of that, if you were to have insurance as good as it is up in canada, and you're single, you're probably paying $450 a month in insurance. That's brings the total you've paid for ""healthcare"" in the US up to $11175 \($9250\) \(, or \~20&amp;#37; of your gross income. How do you feel now about paying 10&amp;#37; up here?

About the German healthcare system. This is fun. Here's a paper published by the a univeristy in the US comparing the german, canadian, and US healthcare systems. I suggest you read it.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3633404/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3633404/)

\(Funnily enough, the German chapter is called ""SOCIALIZED MEDICINE–OVERVIEW, ORIGINS AND HISTORY""\). And while yes, the German healthcare IS partially independent from the government, the government STILL has a ton of control over it, from passing laws, to collecting the funds that fund the socialized healthcare via taxes. So I apologize for generalizing the ""government"" to ""the overall body of legislature that control the healthcare system."" Yes, the German and canadian systems are different, but it is still FAR closer to the Canadian system than to the US system.

Regardless, you're still creating strawmen. Let's find ONE thing wrong with his argument and attack it, without actually answering the questions.

Here's what you argued at the beginning of this thread.

It's the same as US. If you are indigent or disabled, you automatically get insurance here and all of the other social entitlements. Costs in Germany are rising sharply. It's only a matter of time

That's a direct quote from you.

So is the German system ""the same as the US"" or not? What did you mean by ""Costs in Germany are rising sharply."" ""It's only a matter of time"" until what?

You say that there is nothing wrong with private insurance, then IMMEDIATELY contradict yourself. The whole ""evil greedy bastards"" are the REASON healthcare is failing. They're the reason the procedures are so expensive. Take that out of the equation and you get a system much more similar to germany or canada in which healthcare is AFFORDABLE, for everybody, regardless of social stature.

You say all countries are suffering yet almost every other country in the world is healthier than the US. If all countries are suffering, the US is clearly suffering the most. You would think that it'd be easy enough to equate ""percentage of healthy citizens"" with ""how well the healthcare system works"" but I suppose not.

You say that corporations pay more taxes than citizens... Well... you're wrong again. Corporation tax in the US is 21&amp;#37;. That's slightly less than EVERY SINGLE person who makes between $37,000 and $80,000. So, the large majority of american citizens. \(US median income is about $55,000\) So corporations actually pay LESS than the average citizen. So, let me turn your argument back around on you. ""You'd rather make corporations pay and let citizens expend human capital with no consequence?"" If I were you, I'd try to argue that corporations have higher gross so they pay more in total. Again you'd be wrong. Assuming 55&amp;#37; \(the majority\) of the us makes $50,000, comes out to be about 9000 BILLION dollars total. Total corporation income in the US in 2017? About 8000 BILLION dollars total. And we're not even talking about the other 45&amp;#37; of the citizens.\) So no, it is the CITIZENS who shoulder the burden of taxes in the US, not corporations.

And lastly.

The US has healthcare that YOU pay for by taxes, then again out of your pocket, you just don't get to use it unless you pay for it... a third time? \(In terms of deductibles, coinsurance, copays, etc.\)

\(Or I suppose you'll argue that employer provided healthcare is ""free"" to you, which would actually be really funny.\)"
healthcare,"Coverage is not care.  So are you asking about coverage? If so I would tell you the future is about lower cost catastrophic plans with service bundles filling out your personalized coverage based on your utilization and social needs. 

The insured aspect of the plan will be a very narrow and high performing network tied to your employers workforce demographics.

healthcare,"As an American also currently living in Canada (although still have Obamacare as citizenship hasn't gone through yet) I can attest to your post and have had my own experience with emergency medical care where I had to go to the ER, only waited about 15 mins, but was there for about 6 hours. I got a full work up, abdomen ultrasound, a shit ton of lab work, IV fluids and medications (enough to stabilize me to get to the US) ALL for a flat fee of $1,000.00. I. was. Stunned. I expected $1,000 to be just the walking in the door fee.

The point that I was initially making was that the supply of healthcare services will not change regardless when insurance rates paid by insurance companies (private in this case) is lowered.  

The unintended consequence that should be looked at is if (private) insurance companies can afford the risk of having their insurance rates lowered (risk meaning the overall payments are less than the healthcare costs either by few highly intensive treatments or a greater volume of treatments required). I expect most of the smaller companies to fold in this case within the next 10 years leaving the bigger insurance companies left. There will be a point in time where state will need to revisit the decision to go back to increasing insurance rates to reduce the risk for private insurance companies OR make mandatory public health insurance coverage (this is my hope).

Use of Alternative Medicine for Cancer and Its Impact on Survival

Skyler B. Johnson; Henry S. Park; Cary P. Gross; James B. Yu
J Natl Cancer Inst. 2018;110(1):121-124. 

We identified 281 patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer who chose AM, administered as sole anticancer treatment among patients who did not receive conventional cancer treatment (CCT), defined as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and/or hormone therapy. Independent covariates on multivariable logistic regression associated with increased likelihood of AM use included breast or lung cancer, higher socioeconomic status, Intermountain West or Pacific location, stage II or III disease, and low comorbidity score. Following 2:1 matching (CCT = 560 patients and AM = 280 patients) on Cox proportional hazards regression, AM use was independently associated with greater risk of death compared with CCT overall (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.88 to 3.27) and in subgroups with breast (HR = 5.68, 95% CI = 3.22 to 10.04), lung (HR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.42 to 3.32), and colorectal cancer (HR = 4.57, 95% CI = 1.66 to 12.61). Although rare, AM utilization for curable cancer without any CCT is associated with greater risk of death.

Delay or refusal of conventional cancer treatment (CCT), when done in favor of alternative medicine (AM), may have serious survival implications for cancer patients.[1–7] However, there is limited research evaluating the use and effectiveness of AM, partly due to data scarcity or patient hesitance to disclose nonmedical therapy to their providers.[8,9] To address this knowledge gap, we used the four most prevalent cancers (breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal) in the United States[10] from the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2013 to identify the factors associated with AM selection and compared survival outcomes between AM and CCT.

Patients who underwent AM were identified as those coded as ""other-unproven: cancer treatments administered by nonmedical personnel"" and who also did not receive CCT, defined as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and/or hormone therapy. Patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis, stage IV disease based on the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) staging system,[11] receipt of upfront treatment with palliative intent, and unknown treatment status or clinical or demographic characteristics were excluded.

Demographic and clinical factors were evaluated using the chi-square test and the t test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Independent associations with AM use (vs CCT alone) were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Two-to-one nearest-neighbor propensity score matching without replacement was performed to compare overall survival (OS). Univariate survival analyses were completed using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression. Variables with P value of .10 or less on univariate analyses were entered into a multivariable Cox proportional hazards survival model using forced entry for the 2:1 matched sample. The assumption of proportionality was verified graphically using log-log survival plots. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.

We identified 281 cancer patients who chose AM in lieu of CCT. Patient characteristics between AM and CCT are shown in Supplementary Table 1 (available online). Notably, patients in the AM group were more likely to be younger, to be female, to have a lower Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Score (CDCS), and to have higher cancer stage, income, and education. In multivariable analysis, when controlling for clinical and demographic factors, patients undergoing AM were more likely to have breast (odds ratio [OR] = 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.40 to 4.68) or lung (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.85 to 5.40) cancer (vs prostate), higher education (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.08), Intermountain West (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.81 to 5.29) or Pacific (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 2.10 to 4.74) regions of residence, stage II (OR = 3.31, 95% CI = 2.21 to 4.95) or III (OR = 3.87, 95% CI = 2.47 to 6.07) disease, and a lower CDCS (Supplementary Table 2, available online).

Following 2:1 matching, 560 patients who received CCT were matched to 280 patients who received AM based on cancer type, age, clinical group stage, CDCS, insurance type, race, and year of diagnosis; a total of 840 patients were analyzed. There were no statistically significant differences in matched characteristics (chi-square or t test, all P &gt; .10). The median follow-up was 66 months. On matched univariate survival analysis, AM was associated with worse five-year survival (54.7%, 95% CI = 47.5% to 61.3%, vs 78.3%, 95% CI = 74.2% to 81.8%, log-rank P &lt; .001; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.72 to 2.83) (Figure 1A) and remained an independent predictor of greater risk of death (HR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.88 to 3.27) when controlling for clinical and sociodemographic factors (Table 1). When stratified by cancer type, receipt of AM was associated with statistically significantly worse five-year survival for breast 58.1%, 95% CI = 46.0% to 68.5%, vs 86.6%, 95% CI = 80.7% to 90.7%, P &lt; .001; HR = 5.68, 95% CI = 3.22 to 10.04), lung (19.9%, 95% CI = 9.9% to 32.4%, vs 41.3%, 95% CI = 31.1% to 51.2%, P &lt; .001; HR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.42 to 3.32), and colorectal cancer (32.7%, 95% CI = 15.8% to 50.8%, vs 79.4%, 95% = CI 66.3% to 87.8%, P &lt; .001; HR = 4.57, 95% CI = 1.66 to 12.61), but not for prostate cancer (86.2%, 95% CI = 73.9% to 92.9%, vs 91.5%, 95% CI = 84.7% to 95.4%, P = .36; HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 0.68 to 4.17) (Figure 1B, Figure 1C, Figure 1D and Figure 1E) on univariate and multivariable analyses.

Figure 1.

Overall survival of patients receiving alternative medicine (solid lines) vs conventional cancer treatment (dashed lines). Overall survival of alternative medicine vs conventional cancer treatment for (A) all patients, (B) breast, (C) prostate, (D) lung, and (E) colorectal cancers. P values were calculated by a two-sided log-rank test.

Patients who initially chose AM for treatment of curable cancer in lieu of CCT were rare and had statistically significantly worse survival. After controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors, the magnitude of difference was largest for breast cancer because women who used AM as initial treatment without CCT had more than a fivefold increased risk of death. Patients with colorectal and lung cancer had a more than fourfold and twofold increase in risk of death, respectively. Notably, there was no statistically significant association between AM use and survival for patients with prostate cancer. This is not unexpected, given the long natural history of prostate cancer and the short median follow-up in this study. Among our study population, approximately 74.6% of prostate cancer patients had low- to intermediate-risk disease, a subgroup with level 1 evidence showing no difference in risk of death when comparing observation with surgery or radiotherapy and hormone therapy at 10 years.[12]

It is important to note that complementary and integrative medicine are not the same as AM as defined in our study.[13] Whereas complementary and integrative medicine incorporate a wide range of therapies that complement conventional medicine, AM is an unproven therapy that was given in place of conventional treatment. As there is limited evidence of patients who chose AM as the primary treatment for their cancer, accurate comparisons between our cohort and other studies remain difficult. However, there are several important similarities between AM use characteristics and those who seek complementary cancer therapies, including younger age, breast cancer, higher education and income, Pacific region, and more advanced stage.[9,14–16]

One important limitation of our analysis is its observational nature, which may have underascertained the use of CCT for patients who received treatment at another facility or patients who initially received AM prior to presenting to a data-collecting facility. However, these underreported or late presentations would have likely biased our study toward the null (ie, lack of survival difference), making our findings potentially more clinically meaningful. Other limitations of the data include unmeasured confounders or selection bias that could impact survival. However, because patients receiving alternative medicine were more likely to be younger, more affluent, more well-educated, and less burdened with comorbidities, this would not likely account for the observed survival differences. Last, we lack information regarding the type of alternative therapies delivered, though there is limited to no available evidence that specific AM therapies have been shown to improve cancer survival.

In conclusion, we found that cancer patients who initially chose treatment with AM without CCT were more likely to die. Improved communication between patients and caregivers and greater scrutiny of the use of AM for the initial treatment of cancer is needed.

That comparison uses a single private company that isn’t relying on a second entity for doing part of its work and stating because they have a physical asset, they can give away commodities which take resources to reproduce away for free.  When what is really going on its information collection and processing... which copying information is essentially free, and the enforcement would already be occurring due to other taxes.  It is more like saying... oh that firm is using information provided by the Fed! They should include those costs in their administrative cost, because when we compare their costs to this other firm that collected data on their own they had higher costs.  This example is better because one firm is having to perform all the work, and the other firm is using an existing government entity that would already be doing the work provide the information and therefore lowering costs associated with their work."

This is incorrect and the spouse should NOT be bonafide as only stated in the “ plan adoption agreement” you create as a self employed entity for fringe benefits. Also you do not need a employee contract to “hire.” The one clause is this is only good for a single person self employed Non S-Corp. Once you have bonifide employees than you fall into ERISA guidance and then I agree the 105 would make too much of a headache to be practical as you would need to hire a third party to administer. 

Happy to send over more information about self employed 105 plan setup but please do not take this as legal advise.

healthcare,"Patient satisfaction gives next to zero information on how well technology is improving healthcare. Patients are uneducated on how healthcare works as a business. 

Example: physicians are paid for at most 7.5 minutes of face time with a patient. At most, a patient can expect one issue to talk about, yet patient has a laundry list of problems they want to discuss. Patient feels that if they have to pay a 20 dollar copay, then then want their monies worth. Physician keeps appointment short and then sits room after 7.5 minutes. Patient now gives bad review. Patient so angry they give all poor marks across the board on survey. How did this help?

Example: patient has substance abuse problem. Only goal is to get prescription. Physician refuses to provide narcotics and suggests withdrawal treatment clinic. Patient furious, gives horrible reviews.

Example: physicians keep entering all the data ehr registries demand. Physicians continue to increasingly become data entry clerks. Physicians continue to get burned out. Physicians continue to retire early, drop out of medicine, commit suicide. Quality drops as physicians continue to be overworked. The looming physician shortage leaves more and mores patients without access.

If you are a lone provider for let’s call X appendectomies (surgical removal of appendix) in a rural town, you can negotiate a higher rate for them to pay you since you have more bargaining power. Every price that a provider and hospital that is paid by insurance companies is negotiated every year.

healthcare,"Japan and France have excellent health care. Both have a healthy (ha ha!) mix of public and private services. Services are, for the most part, delivered rapidly when needed.

I provide services in Canada. While it’s alright, it does have its faults. For one, each province controls their own health care system and there is little cross over between the provinces. 

The federal government sets the regulations for pharmaceuticals, but there is not national pharmacare program.

There’s also the issue of rationing services. I can only bill government for a maximum amount of procedures and services. When this runs out, that’s pretty much it except for certain third parties (military, provincial auto insurance monopoly). Individuals cannot really pay outs of their own pocket. There are a few exceptions to this such as substance abuse rehab and some psychiatric services.   

Japan also places emphasis on preventive medicine. They have a far better diet and philosophy on general health that most western counties. It’s mostly lip service in Canada. 

I do admire the US system for its pursuit of innovation and patient choice, but its primary care leaves a lot to be desired.

Unlike Medicaid, premium subsidies do not have an asset test, but are affected by revenue from assets (e.g. stock dividends). However, if the parents are living off assets, they might be under 100% FPL ($16,240) and ineligible for premium subsidies because they don’t make enough money. "

However, if you can just wrap your mind around the fact that you had a bad doctor. They are not ALL bad. Call around, go for consults before the actual procedure (that's another thing, don't call it a surgery, call it a procedure, that's actually what it is. It's done in the office, you're not being put under anesthesia, it's simply a ""procedure"") and let the new doctor know exactly what happened, how you felt about it and how you feel about it now. Consult with different doctor's until you find one that you feel comfortable with and one that will take your fears into consideration and then go forth. 

This is really such a simple, easy procedure that can be taken care of properly with the right doctor, you just need to find one that you feel can do the proper job that the first doctor didn't. 

You can DO this! Just take your time, get out there, consult with physician's until you find ""the one"" and know that you can finally get this taken care of and the mental relief will be well worth the effort of tracking down a doctor that will take care of this for you.

She is not on UHC, they are not accepting new providers, it's not going to happen. 

You can either continue seeing her and ask her for a cash rate visit amount, or you can find a provider that is in network for UHC. 

Nothing you say to your PCP or your husband's HR department or to UHC is going to get them to allow you to see this provider when there are plenty of others that are in network. 

I'm sorry, but I don't want you spinning your wheels. It would take months and months of you trying to do appeals or what not that would just end up with a negative response. 

I would love for other professionals to (politely) disagree with me, if you think I'm way out of line, but I used to do billing for mental health and there WERE a few companies that would not let us contract due to their ""number of spots"" being filled up.

We do not need this coverage. We have fantastic health insurance. (Anyone qualifies as long as they have chronic conditions). The only reason we would need to have this extra coverage is to pay for this random $900 surprise bill that was only incurred because the special coverage needed the diagnosis.

healthcare,"Great questions.

1-Just to make sure you are aware, the individual mandate is still in place until the end of 2018. 

2- highly advise you to talk to a local broker, discuss your health needs and have them review benefits and network.

3- as a self employed individual, it does not make any sense ( financially ) to move to the group market unless the group market offers better coverage and plans for a dramatically lower premium. Most insurer group markets do not do “micro groups” unless you go with an association and you also need to account for the fees to join and annual dues. I would also highly encourage you to review your options without going into a group market plan because as a self employed individual you receive two big tax breaks. A) self employed health insurance premium is tax deductible without group benefits. B) section 105 you can “hire” you spouse as a non compensated employee and pay his/her medical expenses tax free. My wife and I are also both self employed and we do the same. We have a HSA high deductible plan. She “hired” me, I “hired” her, both non compensated only 105 benefits. All health costs are then tax free. Highly advise you talk to a local CPA to set this up, there are a few forms that you need to sign to enact a 105 benefit. Then talk to a local broker to review all group and individual plan options.

4- sadly, healthcare at this point has nowhere to go but increase in cost. 

Hope that helps."

Typically hospitals/clinics outsource this.  The date of service confusion is probably just the difference in the date the lab put on their claim as there would have been a lag between when the test was performed and when the lab received the sample/tested the sample vs when they billed it.  One easy way of confirming this is to ask the hospital if they outsource their labwork and who they use.  You could then easily call the lab and ask for Medical Records or just ask them for details regarding their claim.   

As for the Children's Special Healthcare thing, it looks like someone sent your information to them to try and help you get some of your bills covered.  This is a state program specifically to assist with children's medical bills.  They probably want the Diagnosis as they are only authorized to cover certain ones based upon how they are funded.

Healthcare insurance and reimbursements from insurance companies are very complex and vary depending on the insurance company, the services provided by the organization and many other factors. In graduate school insurance is typically a semester long course and sometimes even more than one.

Per member payments are becoming more popular due to the Affordable Care Act changes and a shift in the industry towards managed care models of healthcare delivery. With per member per month insurance contracts, a healthcare provider is paid a lump sum of cash by an insurance agency to “manage” the health of that member for the entire month. If that member over utilized healthcare services the organization can lose a ton of money due to the costs that are provided. However, if the organization manages the care well and the member does not utilize the care as much then you can make substantial profits. It is a high risk type of health plan for the organization but due to incentives created by government it will become more popular with providers.

healthcare,"I'm sorry, these are factually terrible points and I am certain my comment will get downvoted to hell but you are giving advice with so little knowledge of circumstances or actual healthcare delivery that you have no idea what you are talking about. There is a famous expression in Medicine, ""Treatment without Diagnosis is Malpractice."" You have no idea what medically is going on with the spouse in question and the advice you render is absolutely incorrect. On top of that, the advice you lend could cost the OP far more than paying the $650 per month on the employer plan. (which I noticed you did not recommend). 

1) The actual number 2016 is $9,887. But that is including federal healthcare programs that are far higher in cost compared to private company insurance cost. I agree high, but the average cost for private employer and employee on a group plan is $513 per month (Kaiser Foundation). Why the price difference? The employer/healthcare provider does not want to cover the spouse when there are several other comprehensive options for spouse that are less per month (Individual Healthcare Market, healthcare.gov). Insurance is based on a class of risk pool and any employee that elects to enroll the spouse on a high cost plan, the insurer is calculating as high risk. They would rather the spouse find other coverage options through the individual market that is community rated and avoid higher risk claims. 

2) Less than 5% of all companies provide a employer contribution for spouse healthcare coverage of 50% or more. Again, even if they did cover 50% of premium, that would still be $325 per month or more. Telling someone to quit and find a job that provides a comprehensive spousal benefit is ridiculous. 

3) Telling someone that cash may be cheaper is like telling them that gold coins are a great investment. Sure, the OP spouse might have a very minor issue that will have a low cost but that is probably not very likely. The only case where cash may be cheaper is if they are healthy with no current health concerns (what the OP spouse is currently doing). 

4) MEDICARE....  do you know what Medicare is. Is she 65, no... is she disabled for 24 consecutive months and on SSDI... probably not. MEDICARE... is NOT a option at this point. Medicaid is not a option either as Georgia did not expand medicaid. Medicare Divorce, what?? 

5) You know enough about healthcare to be dangerous. 

What should the OP do?

1)He needs to enroll his wife on his employer provided plan ASAP. Yes, it is a lot of money but the potential risk cost with a patient that knows they have health issues is a no brainer. The spouse physican can run the test and find/setup a treatment plan for her condition/s. At this point the OP will have a better understanding of potential cost outlay and if the cost risk is decreased, they can cancel that spousal plan at anytime. 

2) After they have enrolled the spouse on the employer plan, they should go to healthcare.gov and review plan rates and potential tax credits based on income in Georgia. They may be eligible under a spousal loophole if the plan cost exceeds 9.87% of income. They did miss the open enrollment window for 2018 and in most cases are not eligible for this year but, this is their only other option to find comprehensive coverage with no preexisting conditions.

healthcare,"&gt;Completely ignores the fact that the private spending subsidizes the public spending, Medicare and Medicaid typically reimbursing at a loss.

Because it's actually not that simple at all.

Cost-shifting is only possible in markets where providers have more market concentration than payers. [In 2006, Zwanziger and Bamezai looked at California hospitals and found cost-shifting over the period of 1991 to 2003](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.25.1.197) but we can also attribute the increased rates of private reimbursement to the fact that HMOs collapsed over this period. [In 1997, half of all HMOs were unprofitable,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11368736) when for most of the 90's they kept growth rates significantly below their pace the decade before.

The HMO system fell apart not because of changes in public payments but because physicians consolidated and the public revolted against the utilization controls, which wasn't something Zwanziger's paper really addressed.

The reason people should doubt the existence of cost-shifting and be skeptical when it's often only providers making a reform argument is that it implies that hospitals negotiate with private payers on the basis of maximizing access through services, not maximizing operational profit. And who actually believes that hospitals aren't walking into insurance company board rooms trying to maximize their bottom line? 

Cost-shifting is largely over-represented as a theory because it ignores the truism that if hospitals had the capacity to increase revenue by higher prices, they would be doing so already.

And then there's all the literature that says the exact opposite-- that reducing public reimbursements forces providers (in this case hospitals for inpatient care) to invest in more efficient care delivery, [and that 10% reductions in Medicare rates could be associated with 3-8% drops in private reimbursements even after holding for case mix and everything else.] (https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0332) 

Dr. Chapin White offer four explanations:

1.) Many payers base their reimbursements off a percent of Medicare, and so a good chunk of reimbursements are directly correlated to public rates

2.) [Cuts in Medicare are associated drops in treatment intensity both for Medicare patients *and* for privately-insured patients.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20111912?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) This isn't particularly controversial, as anyone would guess that a 1:1 cost-shift wouldn't actually exist, but this does offer the greatest argument for how OVERALL health care spending does decrease when Medicare lowers its rates, and how non-public patients receive more efficient care.

3.) Piggybacking on 2, short-term downward pressures on prices private payers also enjoy comes from the amount of provider contracts that are dependent on service-intensity. This ties in with #2 to ensure these lower costs do get passed on to private insurers.

4.) Shrinking public reimbursements also gives private payers more leverage to reduce more favorable contracts long-term as hospitals wish to increase their proportion in their private/public insurance-mix (I don't like this argument for a couple of reasons, but White's intuition isn't entirely wrong).

I'm going to skim your other points:

&gt;Completely ignores the logistical challenges present in the US of distributing care, supplies, and facilities across 4 million square miles combined with a 320+ million population.

Frickin' Hawaii has one of, if not the most efficient health care systems in the developed world. This is for multiple reasons and I probably can't back the statement up within the character limit of the post, BUT I will just say that they manage to provide some of the lowest premiums in the country despite having the highest cost of living, and this is achieved by being both an early adopter of an employer mandate (and by early, I mean 1970's), granting payers significant power, and a corporate benefit model for hospital management that allows medical resources like MRI machines to be shared instead of hoarded and duplicative. 

&gt;Completely ignores the fact that Americans have much more unhealthy lifestyles than people in other countries. 

Because of the United State's approach to end-of-life care, the levels of obesity and cigarette smoking [actually contribute to less stress on our health system.](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/health/05iht-obese.1.9748884.html) 1 in 3 obese Americans [die before 70.](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736\(16\)30175-1.pdf)

It ain't the costs, it ain't the utilization. To quote the most famous piece of recent health system literature, [""It's the Prices, Stupid.""](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.89)

When I turned 26 I had a high deductible plan, which might be the best option for you if you don’t see the doctor for anything other than vaccinations.  Getting a high deductible plan means you can set up a Health Savings Account.  Money you put into the account is tax deductible and can be used for acupuncture and any unexpected doctors visits.  You can also use HSA funds for dental expenses and to buy contacts.  It also covers LASIK and Invisalign.  The money you put into the account rolls over every year.

That said, a high deductible plan is only a good idea if you have no chronic medical conditions and don’t take any prescription medications.  I don’t have this plan anymore, but it worked well for me.   Now that I have a more robust medical plan through work, I only use it twice a year for an eye exam and a checkup to get my flu shot.

I recommend you get dental insurance.  It is cheap $30 ish a month for the most expensive plans.  It will cover your cleanings and X-rays, and will significantly lower the price of cavities or anything else that might come up."

healthcare,"Yes, but he didn't do anything.

He did take a sample of what he cut out to see what it was, just an ordinary lymph node that started growing, and he allegedly did remove the entire thing. The problem is most likely that bit of thread that was accidentally dropped inside by him, but like I was saying that happened nearly 2 years ago.

The pus\-like thing is white, a tiny bit yellowish. It doesn't smell at all. Right now it's inflamed and growing slowly as like every other time, pus and blood keeps coming there. It's just a small hump right now but it already hurts pretty bad, can't move my head or move my jaw or touch my ear without getting the skin over it stretched, making it hurt. If I don't do anything to it, it keeps flooding until it gets relatively big, stretching skin and it looks very bad. I could leave it as it is just once to see if that does anything, but that pus has to leave my body somehow, doesn't it? Plus what if it just keeps on growing and ending up tearing my skin?

EDIT: also I'd like to mention that I don't think that this happens because we poke it out, because like I said, it happens again every few weeks, the last time this happened was a month ago and it's happening again. Between these the skin gets fully healed"

Try to work with your school, they are your best resource. My college had a psychiatrist on staff who was helpful. Their health clinic may be able to also help you get health insurance. "
healthcare,"Ahh, you're right, it is!

However, EVERYONE gets insurance, regardless of job. (Aka... socialized healthcare.) That insurance covers EVERYTHING, with healthcare being funded 85% by the government. Your insurance does not depend on your job, and you will always have it regardless of which job you take. And if you make less money you pay less into the system. (7.1% max, regardless of salary.)

So basically the German system is the Canadian system but slightly less transparent. 

Private insurance (aka what the US has) exists, but only 9-10% of the country uses it because (surprise surprise) it's expensive!

Nothing you've said differentiates the German system from the Canadian system. I also get insurance through my job, they also pay for part of it and I assume I pay for part of it as well, the rest comes from the government. I really have no idea how you're equating the German, SOCIALIZED healthcare system with the american system. YOU obviously have no idea how it works either stating that ""It's a fifty fifty system meaning that people pay for it so it's not free therefore it's not like the Canadian system.""

Some of that is improved attitudes about health (probably from outside sources), which doesn't cost very much, and some of that is probably improved facilities (shared cost with USA and other helping hand countries).

The USA, on the far end, is also spending a lot on healthcare research and helping other countries.

healthcare,"I used to think the same as you. I thought my taxes up here would be astronomical.

They aren't.

They're only a few &amp;#37; more than they would be in the US. \(Probably\) less than I would be paying if I were to pay for insurance that covers the same amount as the healthcare here. I would imagine an equivalent insurance plan for me in the US would be somewhere around $400\-$500 a month.

I highly, highly doubt you can walk into a diagnostic center in the US and get an x\-ray for $30. I've seen bills for ER visits in the US. I went to the ER for 4 hours once and ended up with a $5000 bill. \(AFTER insurance\) It doesn't make sense. It disadvantages poor and young people. Sure, if you are established and have a job that provides you insurance then why do you care? You don't. But if you're in graduate school? Just got off your parent's insurance? Trying to get yourself a degree to do good work? Why does it make sense that you can't afford insurance? Why does it make sense that the people most likely to get sick \(poor\) are the people least covered? Insurance costs in the US are STILL rising. What will you say when the costs of insurance there costs more than the ""costs"" here? The really funny thing is that your taxes ALSO pay for insurance. Just not yours unless you're on obamacare. You may as well benefit from it... right?

Now look, I'm not saying that Canada's healthcare system would work in the US. The US has a crap ton more people and the costs would be astronomical, but the healthcare system down there right now is in shambles, and if you honestly think otherwise, maybe you should take a look at your medical receipts and try to prove me wrong.

People in other countries think it’s ridiculous how our healthcare system can get away with this because of the loose regulations. After all, you can’t do surgery without an operating room.

The idea that Americans are just unhealthier is just plain wrong. Instead of tackling the root of the problem, politicians and others with interests in our currently expensive way of doing things blame the victim by pointing out our eating habits or inactivity. The British have one of the cheapest and most efficient healthcare systems in the developed world, which is run similarly like our V.A., but is known as “the fat man of Europe”. McDonald’s and doughnuts are available almost everywhere, but only in the U.S. do we pay thousands of dollars more per patient on average for healthcare.

It’s a highway robbery."
healthcare,"You do not think that for example:

If the California Approved Rate for a wellness exam is $100 (Medicare rate of $89), the insurance company can only ""charge"" this amount minus administration fee, the end line reimbursement will be to reset with a negotiated fee schedule of $90 (less the 10% administration fee) to providers. 

I see the potential legislation the complete opposite. If insurers are the delivery vehicle, they get the opportunity to set the negotiated rates (feee schedule) with their contracted network of providers.

Ultimately, providers will be the one taking the price hit. Insurers will be able to pass through the rate cut to doctors/providers while maintaining the administration cost.

healthcare,"A lot of those costs were already in the system. Because of EMTALA, anyone can present at emergency rooms and hospitals must treat them regardless of insurance status. That means, before ACA, poor people without insurance would present at the ER more often because they had fewer options (even for simple things like colds because they couldn’t see a GP without insurance). Meanwhile, the hospital bears that cost without payment (they typically write it off, but some hospitals receive a small payment from Medicare/Medicaid if they see a lot of indigent). Those costs are them spread between all paying patients. So everyone with insurance always paid more because of the uninsured. ACA made it so fewer people were uninsured, so people cold go to see physicians instead of going to the ER (because ER visits are much, much more expensive). Also, the hospitals take fewer 100% loses on the uninsured. "

Healthcare costs escalated at an annual average of just over 7% from 1980 to 2009, nearly 3 Times inflation.

We spend literally twice per capita for healthcare than do Canada, the UK, Japan, South Korea, Germany and France, yet their life spans are longer than ours and no one goes broke because they were diagnosed with cancer, or in a car accident without insurance. 

At some point we have to do one of two things.

1. Quit pretending we are all “free market” capitalist letting the market solve our healthcare problems while simulataneosly guaranteeing treatment to anyone who walks into a hospital;
 
Or

2. Follow the lead of every single other westernized (and even most non Western nations) and stop treating suffering and death as a profit center and provide healthcare to every American, saving us nearly a trillion a year and helping Americans lead longer, healthier more productive lives. "

Nurses also are disposable. We cost money to hire but if a nurse complains about anything you can feel free to see your way out the door there will be a naive new grad ready to take your place.

Nurses are used and abused. If you perform a miracle shift where nobody dies and you were super short staffed then the hospital thinks ""oh you were able to do it...cool...then you can do it again""

Ofcourse if something bad does happen do you think the hospital will really defend the nurse? No, cause they're disposable. Say youre sorry to the family, fire the nurse, hire somebody else who can handle the abuse for a little while until they quit too.

I know very few nurses who work on an inpatient floor because they like it. Most nurses are trying to get whatever experience they can to get transferred somewhere better or to advance to a NP or CRNA.

If course you can search for articles you want and choose headlines that support your desired idea. This isn't 2nd year composition.

The data is accurate, but it doesn't paint an entire picture. The first problem is by considering the us as equitable to compare with the other countries. We have many different economic structures in place which are not congruent with the others. Different governments, global expectations, diversity.

Would it be better to become more xenophobic like some of those countries to pay for more healthcare? Would the us put up with so many rules placed by their government like the others. America is accustomed to freedom and many would have a hard time being so controlled. It's a grass being greener situation. Look up articles on how the NHS is going broke or how Norway is trying to limit immigration. Look up defence spending proportionately to the others. It's easy to spend more money on services when you're not protecting the world. Maybe we should eliminate foreign aid? We spend almost 50 billion a year on helping other countries. Maybe that would help.  What you CANNOT do is simply look over the fence and say, ""I want that too!"". A lot of our healthcare spending is on high technology and new treatments. Should we abandon the latest cancer treatments? Are you willing to tell your mom she can't have the best treatment so that a homeless guy can get better care?

Who is supposed to pay for the healthcare? The government? That means you and I. You are FREE to sacrifice your salary. Maybe you should get rid of your cell phone to help someone. That'll pay the primary care bills for sure. There is no winning in this dilemma. No matter what choice you make, someone suffers.

I also have patients with my advocacy company that only see OON providers, pay in cash - in full, and I submit their bills to get them partially reimbursed. 

For the right doctor, patients will pay cash. "
healthcare,"Actually, there are multiple reasons as to why a doctor’s office would require you to make them your pcp prior to your first visit. If your insurance requires you to select a pcp and the physician you are going to see acts as a pcp but is not the provider listed on your card, they don’t get paid for their visit unless they can get a referral from the provider who is listed on your card (and sometimes the provider listed on the card will refuse to issue a referral to the provider who is going to see you). And yes, an infectious disease doctor can act as a pcp in certain circumstances and they do coordinate all of a patient’s care. 

Another reason is that sometimes if you see a physician who acts as a pcp but don’t see any other pcp-acting physicians, you become attributed to that physician (part of their patient panel), and in the eyes of the insurance company, the physician is legally responsible for your medical care. 

In your particular situation, have you explained to the physician’s office that you’re only seeking them for specialty care and do not plan to change your pcp? The infectious disease practices that our office deals with take both patients, ones that establish to coordinate all their care and others just for specialty. If this office won’t budge, is there another specialist you can see?

healthcare,"Well I'm pretty sure you are aware on how it works. Simply because those ""out of network"" providers doesn't have a contract with those particular health insurance. Those in\-network providers have signed these contracts and agreed to be paid lesser than what patients usually pay them and that insurance will cover up for the less. And I believe this kind of concept will not be legally working if the government has not approved it. That's just how it goes man."
healthcare,"If you add health insurance payment to the government spend, then either we are being fleeced or the healthcare industry in the US is colossally inefficient.
"
healthcare,"So what they are saying is they don't submit claims directly to your insurance provider, in this situation you would need to submit a reimbursement claim yourself for the billed amount to your insurance and your insurance after processing the claim will mail you a check for the amount that is covered under your healthcare plan. This is for you to use to pay the doctor/reimburse you for the covered payout amount of the bill. 
Just because a provider doesn't submit a claim to your insurance for payment directly doesn't mean that your insurance doesn't contract with them or that they won't approve payment on the claim. It just means you have to manually submit the claim to your insurance yourself in order to receive payment from the insurer for the services rendered. This is just a more round about method of claim submission and insurance payouts than what you're used to usually happening where the provider or facility themselves submit the insurance claim to bill your insurer directly and having the insurance policy payment sent back directly to the provider and then if there's any remaining cost share left over that you owe then the provider bills you the remaining much smaller amount (usually a cost share percentage or a set copay) that you yourself are responsible for. 

You can probably find a claims submission form on your insurance providers website, the information you need to fill it out should all be listed within the billing statement the provider sent you, and if there's any missing information from them you need to fill out the form then you can call their billing office and get the needed information from them.

healthcare,"Yep, what threw me off is basic metabolic panel was always covered previously. I'm in healthcare and cannot imagine diagnosing a patient without at least BMP, CBC and TSH.  

My problem is how the insurance providers dictate what's necessary. I included studies that shows the importance of yearly BMP and CBC in my appeals. Seriously, it's exhausting but I'm determined."

healthcare,"nursing math isn't that difficult. It is pretty much basic algebra ""find x"" but even then nowadays the medication dispensers and the computers do the math for you. There is also a pharmacist willing to double check dosages with you.

nursing is great because you can find a job anywhere and the scope of practice is so broad you can do all sorts of stuff from interacting with patients to not interacting with patients. The pay is also pretty live-off-able.

but yeah, if you don't want to do nursing then don't. Nursing school is hell and sometimes you have to trudge through some shitty nursing jobs before you find a nice cushy jobs. Nursing can be shitty. "
healthcare,"To go in a completely different direction, the costs won’t go down until hospital’s/clinic’s administrative costs go down. Less than 10% of what people pay actually goes to the doctor or “provider” (which is another BS thing to deal with - you aren’t a doctor, an NP, a PA, an optometrist/podiatrist/dentist - you’re all just “providers”). All it does is confuse the patient(s).
We have more directors/managers who have business degrees than we do people who actually care for patients and generate income for the hospital.
So on top of the issues with Big Pharm and insurance costs, we have to deal with the bloated levels of administration we have."

healthcare,"HMOs and Blue plans are usually local. There are national options like PPO plans they just cost more and dont cover as much. 

Its also important to understand that going to see random doctors all over the country is not going to provide you very good care. The doctors wont know much about you and you'll likely see the least experienced doctor at the office. 

you should consider finding a doctor who can do remote visits via telemedicine and have them coordinate care with local doctors anywhere in the world. "

healthcare,"If I offered you a Bugatti for 80% off would you buy it?  I'd assume your counter question would be that it would depend on what the cost is.  There in lies a big piece of the problem.  It's not a good deal unless we know the STARTING PRICE.  We dont understand what the actual cost of care is.  

Then we have Medicare.  The number 1 purchaser of healthcare in the country.  Medicare costs raise anywhere from 1-3% year over year.  Why so consistent?  Because the cost is based on the ACTUAL cost of care (plus a little bit more).  

So what about your PPO discount?  The way I see it, network discounts are kind of a made up thing.  The negotiation is between the insurance companies and providers.  How often do we get to view those contracts?  Whats that 80% discount based off of?  Now you may want to ask yourself,  what incentive does and insurance company have to lower premiums?  

Who's setting the price here?  I suspect a markup.  

Also keep in mind that CLAIMS drive PREMIUMS.  Why is it that our care is so expensive but the quality of outcomes is unimaginably low compared to the rest of the industrialized world?  In order for an insurance company to please shareholders etc.  they need claims to increase.  The lack of transparency in this system enables those claims to rise.  Think about it - do you research quality outcomes? Do you decide whether or not a visit to the local specialist is WORTH THE MONEY? Maybe the specialist in the next town over is, but they're outside of your network.  Maybe that results in more claims and additional dr. visits... 

So there is an endless amount of variables to answer your question OP.  Until we're able to follow the money, are able understand what the actual cost of care is and have the tools at our disposal to negotiate those cost, we are gong to be stuck in this cycle.

healthcare,"I'm interested to hear what other people have to say about this one, but here is my take.

Healthcare data in the US is captured in a variety of ways. Many healthcare systems are capturing this information electronically, though some are still using paper charting. Of those that are electrionic, some leverage one of the major HIT vendors out there, some use a collection of niche systems for the various areas of the organization, and some are using ""home-grown."" systems. So even though we have a large number of procedures being captured electronically, the data are stored in different ways, by different systems, on different servers across the world. Although there are incentives and requirements to report certain metrics to governmental agencies, there is no central repository to which you can connect and retrieve comprehensive information for the country at large. Interoperatbility, data warehousing, and cloud-based storage are hot topics which continue to gain priority across the board, so people are interested in gaining the visibility you're asking about.

Note: This is not to say that different systems do not have access to procedure information from other systems (i.e., chart-sharing is something that is very much underway). Reporting on this global scale is something else.

healthcare,"You are trying to utilize healthcare in a way that it is not designed. Most retirees (snowbirds, ex-pats) typically go to their home state once per year for the exact reason of seeing their primary doctors and taking care of any persistent healthcare needs. 

Healthcare and Insurance has been transitioning over the last 20 years to community based/focused healthcare. That means that your insurance plan/doctor network will only be focused on your community (zip code/county). There are several good reasons for this, better health outcomes are certainly one of them as you want to see physicians that are familiar with your health needs and have comprehensive records for baseline analysis. 

That being said, if you are traveling across the country any emergency room will be in network and every state will have in-network Urgent Care facilities for you to visit. Some words of advice, Emergency room only if you feel you are in severe health jeopardy, Urgent care for everything else. 

If you do go and see a primary care physician in other states for primary/specialty care, it may end up costing you more as they will probably re-order new test and treatment protocols that you may have already done with a previous doctor in a different state.  

Once you turn 65 and are medicare eligible, you can utilize a nationwide network of doctors through what is typically known as ""Traditional Medicare"" with a Supplemental (Gap) plan. 

Hope that helps!"
healthcare,"I certainly trust nurses to know their own business better than I do! I tried to figure out exactly what it is that the American Nurses Association objects to about but couldn't figure out what they disagree about.

Thanks for linking to the Aiken et al paper. The correlation between more nurses and patient mortality/FTR seems like compelling evidence that something should be done to increase the number of nurses on staff. While I am definitely an advocate for cutting health care costs wherever possible, I wouldn't want to do it at the expense of human life.

Since you sound like you know a fair bit about nursing &amp; nursing politics, I was wondering if you could answer a question for me. When nurses go on strike, where do the back-up carers come from? [About 5 years ago some nurses on California went on strike](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/26/california-nurses-strike-patient-death), and were then locked out after the strike. During the lock out, a patient died at one of the hospitals after she was administered medication incorrectly by a temporary nurse stand-in. The article refers to the administrator as a ""temporary replacement carer,"" so probably not a nurse. But what kind of training/background would this person have had?"

healthcare,"I am working on my MHA right now, and am about to enter the ""administrative residency"" portion for my last 6 months. I believe that he may be overstating the importance of the specific school selected. If you go to a CAHME accredited program, there will be plenty of opportunity to network at ACHE events, and there should be opportunities for internships, residencies, and fellowships which will give you the opportunity to network in healthcare organizations.

My residency is unpaid, but members of my program who have taken this residency ended up getting a a paid position afterwards with around 70k salary starting. The residency is in a city where cost of living is high, so if you go to a lower cost area the salary may be lower. 

If you end up going for an MHA, get involved in ACHE to increase your ability to network with people. Attend ACHE congress, I waited until my second year to do this and it was very easy to meet a lot of people, and I know some people who were offered jobs or residencies coming out of it. "

healthcare,It just shows that the average plan doesn’t actually cover a substantial portion of the average beneficiary’s health expenditures. Look around the $4k spending mark. The graph shows that the ~20% of beneficiaries who have between $3k and $5k worth of medical expenses only get a very small portion of those expenses covered by their insurer (that proportion is represented by the lines). The vast majority of that cost gets paid out of pocket by the patient.
healthcare,"Yes, people are amazed by this (as I am). Why they do it? I assume to encourage sign ups. However, a penalty beyond a token amount doesn't make sense."
healthcare,"Well, maybe we have different definitions of ""quality"" and ""experience"". 

All of your examples are spot on though, especially the one about patients giving bad reviews because of doctors controlling medications. 

I should of prefaced that I was referring to health plan cahps surveys. From your examples I assume you are close to the provider side of things, and probably have experience with cg cahps or hcahps. Again though, I'm not disagreeing with your examples.

However, patient experience is absolutely a factor in health care quality. What they ""dig"" is important. Some examples:

Did your doctor explain things in a way you could understand? Did your doctor spend enough time with you? Did your insurance customer service treat you with courtesy and respect? Were they able to give you an answer? Were you able to get an appointment with a specialist in a timely manner? Were you able to have access to a language translator when receiving health Care?

I'd argue that these all factor into the ""hollistic"" quality of healthcare. You probably know this, but all health care quality governing bodies agree. NCQA, CMS, AHRQ, DOH (at least in my home state of NY) etc all incentivize and score insurance companies based in part on how their membership answers experience and satisfaction related measures. Hell, the New York state QUALITY incentive ($ payout to Medicaid insurers) is 20% based on the cahps scores. 

So, we probably come from different environments, but in my realm, patient experience and satisfaction are absolutely a part of health Care quality. "

healthcare,"Another factor that drives healthcare costs up more rapidly in the U.S., as mentioned by others in this thread, is the cost of medications.  Effectively, U.S. consumers subsidize medication costs in the developing world.  This is essentially because Big Pharma wants to recoup their investment in R&amp;D through high prices, and no one in the U.S. system sets limits on this: Americans are free market fundamentalists.  

An example: sofosbuvir, which is used to treat hepatitis C, is list price in the U.S. $94,000 for complete treatment.  Now, no one really pays that, but the actual price can be close to $50,000/complete treatment for, as an example, prison systems in various states.  But you can get sofosbuvir for $900 in some developing countries.  And really, patients in developing countries are not helping to defray the cost of developing the meds.  If you amortized the cost of sofosbuvir's development (Gilead bought it for $11 billion), and you add in delivery costs, and you provided the developer/owner, say, $30 billion of profit, the cost per the 71 million hep C patients worldwide would be: $777.  That's a far cry from $94,000, right?  And much closer to $900.  

In a sense, American patients shoulder an unfair share of the cost of developing medications, which should really be shared more by other countries, where the pricing usually takes into account only manufacturing and distribution costs, and does not take into account R&amp;D costs at all.  Granted, citizens in developed countries are more able to shoulder additional costs, but in my experience Medicaid patients in the U.S. have increasingly much in common with patients in less developed countries.  The ""first world"" is becoming more spotty in supposedly ""first world"" countries, particularly the U.S. ..."

healthcare,"Colombia (i live here) because doesn't matter if you have an income or not, all person have the right to access to any treatment or drug prescribed by its medical doctor. Teorically the system works because the persons who have an income pays a fee that not only cover its disease, but it contributes to finance the founds for the health of the persons that live in poverty. Also, the “high” salaries pays an extra fee to that fund. Each person has the liberty to choose the entity that manage their contributions (mainly for profit corporations, but also with non profit entities) who are strictly vigilated by the goverment. So each health provider entity (HPE) must implement programs of preventive health in order to have an operative utility. The only problem consist in the sistematic rejection of some of the HPE to provide the treatment or medicine prescribed. In that case the pacient or its family have in hand a “constitutional” action against the HPE demanding the judge to order to the HPE the beggining of the treatment or the delivery of the medicine. So, the system is good  because at the end the treatment or medicine is delivered, but the real problem is that for some persons the help arrives to late. If you have any questions maybe i could answer to it later."

The tax burden in places like Canada, UK, Austrailia, South Korea, Israel, New Zealand etc is LOWER than it is on your average American worker, yet they get top flight national healthcare for half the per capita price that we do. 

The best of everything? Medical technology in the UK, or Germany, or Canada is exactly the same as it is here. 

Drug and pharmaceuticals are exactly the same. We simply pay more because we don't bother negotiating as a nation. 

Why the US pays 3 times more for the same drugs:

I would suggest a perusal of this non-profit, non-partisan orgs dash board.

https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/?sfid=4356&amp;_sft_category=access-affordability,health-well-being,spending,quality-of-care

The US spent over 3 trillion last year on healthcare, more than 30% of it was spent on ""administrative costs"", i.e. the middle men and their profit margins, insurance and pharma company advertising etc. 1 trillion dollars on administrative costs. Medicare, which by all metrics works like a German built machine and is highly popular with older Americans spent 2% on administrative costs. 

Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Austrailia? All less than 13% of their total healthcare spending went to ""administrative costs"" 

So in summary, Americans tax burden is the same, or ""slightly"" lower than most other western nations, but they all get national healthcare as part of it. 

We pay astronomically more, don't cover everyone, end up with shorter lives and worse outcomes and use the same technology that every other western nation does. 

Sounds like a screaming bad deal.

Based on your comments of roughly 30K per year income, plus wife at 5K forecast plus first 4 months of year, I would assume you MAGI is somewhere close to 45K-50K for the year. Your wife is not eligible for Medicaid due to household income. It would need to be less than 32K for the year. Your child is eligible for CHIP if you make less than 81K for the year AND if your state expanded medicaid eligibility. 

A local navigator will help you enroll on a plan, a local broker will help review your options and recommend the most appropriate plan. Navigators are designed to help low income and non english speaking population enroll on plans through the health exchange systems. 

I am not sure what site you are using that has the redirects and contrary to other comments, this has nothing to do with Trump. There are a lot if spammy sites pushing ""healthcare exchange"" options that are NOT affiliated with healthcare.gov. Healthcare.gov is the sight you should enroll on. If your state has its own exchange system, healthcare.gov will let you know where to go. 

AGAIN, talk to a local broker. They can review her current doctors and medications and make a ""recommendations."" Navigators are prohibited by state and federal law unless they are licensed ""producer/broker.""  "

healthcare,"We have a medical residency bottleneck in the United States. Every year, more than 7000 U.S. citizens fail to match into medical residency position each year.  There are probably more than 7,000 to 30,000 total who are not accounted for that have not matched
No one will hire MDs/DO without a residency. This creates a surplus of US citizen physicians with defaulted student loans, over $300,000+ of student loan debt and an inability to work clinically or non-clinically in any capacity. 
Please stop allowing non-U.S. citizens to take the already scarce residency positions. The U.S. is unique in that it accepts foreign students before their own citizens. For example, The EU has the Schengen treaty and it works with their health and safety organization the HSE. These organizations put forth laws to ensure that EU students are selected first. This means that a direct-entry medical student who has barely passed, or failed a year in the EU, will be offered an internship before an international graduate-entry student who has come top of his/her class. Other countries such as Australia and Canada also choose their students first and then select from the foreign graduates once their positions are filled.  In the U.S., however, there is no legislation for this to occur.

Non-U.S. citizens immigrate to the U.S., become head of their departments, then proceed to favor and support foreign-born medical school graduates. The foreign-born medical students have an advantage over U.S. citizens because the USMLE allows them to take OUR medical boards in their home county where the standards are questionable. One-third of the U.S. medical residency positions are taken by non-U.S. citizens. 

Many foreign doctors take the USMLE in their home country and score 99 percent. This is a nine-hour exam administered only in English.  One of the hardest exams in the world and they are getting the highest scores. Testing outside of the U.S. allows cheating and score inflation. Please stop this practice. All residency candidates should take the USMLE in the USA to ensure that all the standards are the same.

Sure, but it doesn't make sense that the *net premium paid* is lower in these states with more expensive insurance. 

The article does take into account CSR, and it does analyse more than just the 3 states mentioned:

""...for individuals age 40 with income between 200-400% FPL,  every $100 decrease in SLCSP official premiums is correlated with paying $45 more for a bronze plan on average (assuming they use their APTC to buy the cheapest bronze plan). For people between 100-200% FPL, every $100 decrease costs them $17.50 (assuming they decide to use their APTC to buy the cheapest silver plan, which they need to to qualify for a special reduction in cost-sharing).""

Ultimately, I think the point stands that the ACA's incentive structure was so wonkily designed that efforts to lower costs ended up hurting poorer consumers, which is a completely perverse incentive. "

When I compare insurance plans, I know it sounds like a pain, but if there isn’t a comparison chart provided by HR or the insurance company (it’s always worth asking), I bust out excel and start crunching numbers. How much are deductibles, what is the monthly cost, what are the co-pays, compare the in and out of network expenses, etc. Also consider future medical expenses, are children anywhere in the future, is there existing conditions that need to be covered, is there a specific doc you like (if so called to see which ones they are in network), etc etc.

Regardless, I'm really sorry to hear that. Is your insurance through the government or is it a private plan? It can sometime be that the hospital doesn't want to deal with the lower reimbursement rate of programs like medicaid. So they'll be dicks and only offer appointments further out, at really shitty times, or with PAs/nurses instead of MDs/DOs. You might have better luck if you show up in person to schedule. 

Even with private plans you can sometimes just get better service out of network.

healthcare,"That's.....not quite true.  Besides the fact that Medicare is BY FAR the largest payor (and largest customer base) the volume of Medicare beneficiaries and the services they require means they actually pay out the most.  This fact does allow them greater negotiating strength and as a result they do tend to pay out less per-service or per-item.  But again, as any hospital or office manager who deals with Medicare patients will tell you, they are the largest payor.

I don't necessarily know how to respond to OP.  I have a lot of respect for doctors.  I know they are under a lot of stress and they often have to deal with people who seems to have unreasonably high expectations (""Look all I want you to do is give me pills that will cure my hypertension, COPD, diabetes, and obesity -No don't tell me to lose weight and exercise, just give me a pill or something!"") which can cause them to feel hopeless or frustrated.  I don't know your mother nor do I know the doctor, so I don't know if she gave a genuine account of the interaction and the doctor was rude, or if she maybe didn't understand what he said, and took offense at the doctor's recommendation to lose weight.  Typically however you can see another doctor either within the practice or in another practice.  There are also websites that rate the providers, and she should give her feedback.

healthcare,"Well, I don't have Aetna, but it is most assuredly the deductible amount.

Not sure how much you know about insurance. 
The deductible is how much YOU have to pay BEFORE the insurance will pay for anything. So if you have (just playing make believe here) a doc that charges 50 bux per visit, then you will have to pay for 6 doc visits before insurance pays anything.

There will most likely still be a copay that you pay EVERY time you see a doc.

You really can't just pick a plan and know you're getting your money's worth. You need to sit down and write the numbers down. 

How many visits do you THINK you'll need? Primary care of course,  it what about any procedures you need done? Mole removed? Sleep apnea? Joints that have been bothering you? Anything you can think of.

Add up the associated copays. Add up the premiums. Cost balance all the numbers.
 
Then decide what type of a risk taker you are. Do you want to face a hefty bill should you end up in the hospital? Check how much they pay for occurrences like that. Is your desired hospital in-network?

Make sure all the docs you visit are in-network, otherwise you always have to pay more.

If you know you will NEVER use the insurance, get the cheapest, but with those numbers so close, you can pretty much get any of them...IF you WONT use it.

I normally pay more for a lower deductible, as long as it averages out. 

One thing I would suggest is to see if they have a High Deductible Health Savings Account. Mine rocks. I load my card with money I may use in healthcare. Tax-free! That saves me 35% I would have used post tax.
Plus my employer pays half of my deductible.

Nursing is complex and we need great minds to enter the profession. We have plenty of qualified candidates with current standards.

healthcare,"I think the problem with this article is it misses a few key points. Tennessee and Louisiana have historically had higher premiums on the individual market compared to California. If all states, excluding Alaska and Hawaii use the same 400% FPL (Federal Poverty Level) Calculator, and tax credits are issued per second lowest silver cost plan, it only makes perfect arithmetic that subsidies would be higher in Tennessee and Louisiana. If used for a bronze/silver level coverage option, would see the most significant savings through tax credit. Also, it does not account for CSR (Cost Sharing Reduction) for low income when funding was cut off by the Trump Administration. We can argue semantics but yes it was reckless for the Trump administration to cut, it was also reckless that the Obama Administration and Dems did not account for funding in the original ACA bill. The CSR cost distribution when canceled was defined per state. For example, California placed a cost on subsidized plans and not on unsubsidized plans. Often called the ""silver switcharoo."" Trust me, not my words but a good Charles Gaba write up. http://acasignups.net/tags/silver-switcharoo
Tennessee and Louisianan did a full silver load, this again, adding to the total cost of all silver plan and increasing the already different price disparity between California and Louisiana, Tennessee. 

Its is not a apples to apples comparison. 

I agree only on funding principle that individual state marketplaces, and the marketplace itself, is a huge annual cost that individual market policy holders cover through carrier fees and taxes and should have never been part of the ACA if its initial goal was to create lower cost healthcare. 
"
healthcare,"I was traveling for work for a few days and did not have a chance to respond. 

&gt;Of course we must pay higher taxes for more services. We already do pay more to private insurers in the form of co-pays, co-insurance, premiums, and other out-of-pocket expenses not deemed usual, customary, and reasonable

I don't understand what you mean by this. If your point is that we pay more per point of service than anywhere else in the world, you are correct. Also, by creating universal healthcare and making it single payer only, we would still have the highest cost healthcare in the world. Taxes and single payer do not somehow absolve us of these cost burdens. There is this idea that if we just get rid of insurance, that will solve the problem. That is incorrect. If we get rid of insurance and follow medicare admin rates, we only save roughly 6% of total medical spending. National Average admin rate Group and Individual 10.7% (2016).

&gt; Now, how is it that other developed countries with single-payer systems cost less per person on average than the United States? 

This is a much tougher question because each country has its reasons and it is not a uniform answer of ""because they have single payer"". For example, Switzerland has (for profit) private insurance and have much lower admin rates and cost. Germany has lower admin rates with a combination of (for profit)private insurance and public universal policy. Canada has much lower admin rates with national healthcare single payer. Again, you cant point to one specific reason even when you look at the delivery vehicle for healthcare. 

The 3 most likely reasons is
1) cost of goods and services in the US is far higher. We create 60% of the worlds bio medical research, patents, medical goods and treatment protocols. The nearest competitor is Britain with 10%. The US manufacturer does not have a regulatory body to price medical goods and services like other countries and if they want access to sell products in foreign countries, they have to price goods at the market rate in each international market. What happens is the manufacturer will often make up losses by increasing the price domestically.  I know the quick answer is that all we need to do is create a similar pricing mechanism here domestically, that would only lead the manufacturers to open up shop in other countries and the US would loose valuable (high income) jobs and tax revenue. Not as cut and dry as one would want. 

2) We pay our doctors more. 30% - 50% more per service on average. If your idea is to pay doctors less, this will have a net loss as we do attract better physicians in the US because of compensation rates. This would also need to be included in education reform to make becoming a licensed MD easier by removing the AMA Med School enrollments caps and cheaper tuition ( I think we will leave education reform for another debate). 

3) Administration - We already talked about this but again, it is the smallest cost compared to the first 2 reasons. 

&gt;Medicare is expensive because it covers an already sick group of people no private insurer would cover without heavy subsidies, and it’s been handicapped with an inability to negotiate drug prices, but it’s still the most efficient program we have in America outside the V.A. Administrative costs are in the single-digit percentage points and have a greater percentage of revenues going towards actual healthcare without added costs, like marketing and shareholder returns.

Again, not a simple answer. Medicare is highly subsidized by US Tax Payers and it does not cover only the sick on disability, it covers the elderly of 65 and over. Claim rates for medicare is around 22% and yes has a higher risk pool with those under 65 standard insurance. The administrative cost is lower because they have a wider pool. We have insurance laws that each state control its insurance market. Because our healthcare is fragmented with providers, when looking at claims administration, the larger carriers (enrollment) typically have the best admin rates. Medicare has better admin rates (roughly 4% depending on who you are talking to) because it has a large user pool and only accounts for Part A and Part B distributions. It does not account for the cost to collect the funds through the IRS or the accounting for ancillary insurance and Part D plans. Also, Med Advantage HMO plans have almost identical admin rates compared to traditional medicare and include Part D and fund collection. Regarding the VA, I am a prior service member and when I got out of the military I was using the VA for the first 12 months. I would highly recommend you go and volunteer at your local VA. Our injured veterans need help and support. If you do volunteer and still come back and tell me that is the healthcare you want, then I will concede the point. 

&gt;Taxes should no longer be a four-letter word in the U.S. We have to come to terms with the proven fact that government-run services like Medicare and Social Security can do better than private programs and cost much less too.

Who said taxes are a four letter word? The basic economics truth is the higher taxes are raised, the lower the economic output. I think there is a fine line of how high taxes can be raised in order to fund a program like single payer. Its a lot like universal basic income, it sounds great, but when you find out the tax rate needed to fund, it makes it unappealing. 

I just want to convey how tough this is to find a pragmatic solution to reform. Healthcare is 18% of our GPD and a report issued by the Brookings Institute a few years back even said that if you want to dramatically reduce the cost of healthcare, you are also going to have one hell of a recession. Although 18% is medical spending, it does not account for downline business that support our healthcare industries. If we create a single payer system that tries and ration care to meet a more manageable 12% of GPD, you can all but count on a brutal recession if not sustained depression. 

 I agree with you that we need universal healthcare. I probably disagree on how we get there. 

Sorry for the long post. Thanks for the great discussion.

healthcare,"These plans are good for young, healthy people. You'll get your insurance contracted rates whole spending minimal money on healthcare and also having coverage if something really bad happens.

A preventative visit is free each year. Do you anticipate needing to see your PCP more than that? 

Someone else noted, if an HSA is available contribute to that.

Healthcare is incredibly expensive. Expecting your employer to pay premiums that cover most of the cost is unrealistic. People need to start realizing healthcare is an expense they should plan for. "

healthcare,"But one of the issues here is that salaries \(which tbh are already often pretty good, though it depends on the place\) aren't what primarily attracts more nurses. Or, in any case \(but at least as importantly\), that that's not what persuades them to stay in the job.

Medscape had a ""Nurse Career Satisfaction Report"" a year or two ago, according to which few nurses point to their salary as the most satisfying aspect of their work, but many of them instead mention wanting shorter or more flexible job hours, more autonomy, more appreciation from administrators, especially when it comes to the resources they needed to do the work. Or they complained about on\-call shifts and overtime, rotating shifts, a lack of support.

In that light, overburdening nurses with irresponsibly high number of patients seems a sure\-fire way to chase away nurses and potential nurses. You can only buy your way out of that with higher salaries for so long.

So if you want to reduce the nursing shortage, raising salaries and reducing red tape can't be enough. You've also got to offer nurses \(as well as patients\) the kind of protections that the minimum nurse\-to\-patient ratios bills are all about."

healthcare,"This is not quite right in my experience.  MCOs often pay hospitals on a FFS basis. The reimbursement methodology may be on a per diem basis or on a per claims basis (I.e., a DRG methodology). Most insurers have moved to DRG because it incentivized the hospital to reduce cost. If hospitals receive a flat amount, they can maximize their profit by cutting costs. This prevents costs from rising. 

To understand why DRGs save money over time, it’s helpful to understand hospital IP costs and per diems. The hospital has their highest cost on the first day. Generally speaking, they cost to care for the patient decrease each day (assuming they are getting better over time and need fewer resources each day, such as pills, bandages, other medicines). Under per diem, they hospital receives the same flat amount each day. So, cynically speaking, if the patient recovers very quickly and the hospital has not “broken even” on the patient, they could keep them a couple extra days, and make money every time. Also, at a macro level, the hospital makes the most money when they have a high census (I.e., all their beds are full), so again, cynically, they hospital could keep well patients instead of releasing them to keep each room reimbursable. 

Under DRG, there is no incentive to keep patients longer than the absolute minimum. 

It the interest in absolute clarity, doctors determine when patients will be discharged (not the hospital, however a lot of the doctors work directly for the hospital). And DRGs include outlier payments, which prevent hospitals from losing a lot of money when there are especially long or expensive stays. "
healthcare,"Physicians CANNOT charge whatever they want. This is misleading. You could have a lemonade stand and charge 10,999 dollars a cup, but no one will buy it. So you charge what people will pay. 99% of healthcare already has agreed upon prices. 

Insurance is the problem. And after obamacare, it only gets worse. Think of if a million extra people wanted to get care, but didn't pay for it. Everyone else has to pay for them. Cost goes up if the insurance company has to pay for more people, especially if that population isn't educated. 

Now, imagine if you got an unlimited gift certificate to Target. Would you be conservative and get what you need, or buy everything your heart desires. Now imagine all the extra people that got Obamacare. When patients use healthcare for every ache and pain, someone has to pay for it. Introducing higher premiums. 

Physicians are underpaid."
healthcare,"Try checking Cigna. I have Cigna insurance for myself. I got my insurance from my job. I also know that they have this low deductible plan so it's not that expensive.

Try contacting them as soon as possible to verify if the office visit will be covered and just the copay that you need to pay. To know what is her medical condition. This is just my opinion. I hope this helps. "
healthcare,Indeed to that !
healthcare,more detailed an accurate.
healthcare,"You are getting a lot of bad anecdotal information here so let me address the actual cost increase for 2018 and for most likely 2019.

If you look at the morbidity table and cost run out, our healthcare has been averaging a 9.1% inflation over the last 10 years. The ACA (Obamacare) was designed to tackle this problem but so far, it has proven very ineffective. We need a better solution to fix the rising cost of healthcare vs the CPI. 

But the 25% number is entirely different from t he response you have received. Basically if you deduct the average of 9.1% table increase, we have and additional  14-16% increase year over year. Here are the exact reasons why:

1) child age banding, the HHS and CMS has increased the 3:1 ratio to include down to age 14. Basically, the 3 to 1 gap was stated in the ACA that a 64 year old cannot pay 3 times what a 20 year old pays. This has been expanded down to age 14 to 64. So the pricing ratio has increased for all because the pricing community rating spread has changed. The main purpose was to try and shore up insurance company losses.

2)CSR reimbursement. The ACA states that the insurance company must provide CSR benefits to low income households. This is a pricing mechanism that allows for example; a low income household to purchase a silver level plan and receive a discounted deductible and copays. The insurance company would be reimbursed from the federal government for losses with CSR discounts. This worked fine from 2014-2017 but the Trump administration canceled the CSR payments but the ACA still mandates insurance companies to provide. So the insurance company had/has to increase premiums for everyone to cover this loss.

3)individual mandate cancelation. The ACA has mandated all households to provide proof of “qualified” coverage or face federal penalty. This was made to help insurance companies provide insurance to all individuals but they could not exclude due to Pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration canceled the penalty for 2019 and left insurance companies in the dark. If the insurance company must provide guaranteed issue healthcare regardless of health class, but does not have a market enrollment driver like federal penalties to entice healthy population to enroll in healthcare, there only option is to raise prices significantly, 

4) Healthcare losses. 4 our of 5 insurance companies are loosing money with the ACA requirements. The ACA required higher level of coverage options and carriers facing difficult enrollment figures with higher risk pools have only one option. Raise the price. 

TLDR; the ACA and Trump Sabotage is directly responsible for the significant rate increase."

healthcare,"Just want to add that most of the time it isn’t the doctor’s deciding what to charge— it’s the hospitals. Something like 80% of doctors work for hospital systems and are salaried (fixed rate), meaning the hospital is entirely responsible for your bill. Each person’s final bill is based on a negotiation between the hospital billing dept and the insurance company, so each patient is ends up paying a different amount for the same procedure. Doctors have no way of knowing this and don’t set the prices. 

I don’t think it’s right to use doctors as the scapegoats for the flaws of the healthcare industry when they have relatively little say compared to the insurance companies and hospitals. "

You can also try Zocdoc. They are an online appt scheduler for doctors and lets you see daily and weekly availability.

healthcare,"Yes, physicians are underpaid -- at least, primary care physicians are.  I can't agree that specialists are underpaid.

I agree that there is a disconnect between consuming health care and paying for it.  The system we have insulates patients from real costs, so they don't have realistic/responsible perspectives on care.  That said, there are too many people who simply do not get decent care in this society, even now.  The ACA was a step in the right direction, but it was like stepping into the middle of the highway: it's not sustainable.

In my view, we either need to go to a radically free-market approach to deliver health care (everyone competing in every market, a true free market), or we need to go single-payer.  Transitioning from the crony-capitalist system we have now is hard because too many people in control of the regulatory system benefit from the status quo.

But two countries in modern times had to transition from a system like ours to systems that provide universal coverage, Taiwan and Switzerland.  If they can do it, we can do it -- but we'll have to drag the insurers kicking and screaming the entire way."

You need to be an active consumer of healthcare, not a passive participant. Ask you doctors questions (""is this the cheapest drug?"" ""Do I really need this test or is there a cheaper one?""). Use the health plan's website to find the top rated, cheapest doctors. Use mail order to get cheaper prescriptions.

"
healthcare,"Nursing is a pretty big profession, literally millions of us. There exist a large group of ""travel nurses"" who will rotate from hospital to hospital as they are needed. They receive premium pay in the form of tax benfits and stipends towards living expenses.

Most of the time when a hospital goes on strike by a union, the hospital will be forced to hire agencies to hire sometimes hundreds of these travel nurses. The hospitals pay these nursing agencies over a $100 an hour for their services, that's easily over twice the amount of their own employees even after benefits are factored in. If you could imagine the sheer scale of replacing the majority of a large hospital staff with this workforce, things get expensive quick. 

Nurses in the hospital are generally Rn's, however LPN can provide nursing care provided it's in the scope of the state Nurse Practice Act. In my state, LPNs can not provide IV push medication injections or provide admit/postsurgical assessments. We use them, but they require coordination with an RN to some degree. 

A temperory replacement carer may refer to a travel nurse, who may be unfamiliar with the facility equipment, medication concentration (the same medicine can come in many different strengths according to manufacturer and can be lethal if administered inappropriately.) The travel nurse is likely a RN as travel LPN's typically arnt a thing in an acute care setting.

Nurse staffing has a direct correlation with quality of care, and with a drop in quality, you get increased amounts of complications (the hospital will eat these costs thanks To DRG'S) slower recovery, loss of life, coworker or patient injury (d/t falls or improper safe patient handeling). 
"
healthcare,"Lol. Well thought out and I agree. Both are better than the atrocity we have now. Specialists also seem to have the scales tipped in their favor. Eliminating tort claims can help get those numbers lowered.

I think we should only use single payer for catastrophic illness. Cancer, heart surgery, limb replacement, the things that are really expensive. Nobody seems to understand that the cost will go way down with a free market system. Of course that will depend on loosening up the stacks and stacks of data entry docs have to do now (for free).

I peruse the single payer idea, but then read about the consistent rising costs of healthcare in those countries, coupled with the services the govt. doesn't deem necessary. Theoretically is business pick up the brunt of healthcare costs, the money will go back in to the businesses through consumer purchasing. Of course, the wages could go down to compensate, or the prices may go up.

healthcare,"Your suggestions have some flaws. You're assuming that the actual QUALITY of healthcare is better because of statistics. What's the point of having an extra couple years life expectancy if the last couple years are suffering and inadequate care. Healthcare is a business. People have to be paid in EVERY country. Other countries limit higher cost technology and procedures in order to keep costs lower. All countries have simultaneous failing systems. Where some have attributes others have detriments. Would Americans be happy with a health panel that says, ""No. You cannot get treatment. Those machines cost too much.

Well, you may claim they can then pay out of pocket for the expensive things other countries won't provide. The thing is, they take more taxes so there is less income to pay for such instances.

American healthcare is so high because Americans are used to getting the best of everything. The culture of getting everything for free has overused the intention of insurance and caused moral hazard. Healthcare is not a right in America. If you want, I can give you links to organisations that would happily take 30% of your pay check and help people get the care they need. You seem more then willing to donate money."

healthcare,"Quality of healthcare is almost impossible to measure. Despite there being no great way to measure quality I would still argue that US healthcare is among the top if not the top. 

People often use the argument that the average length of life is less in America to suggest lower quality healthcare but that is not true. The main reason Americans die younger than other countries is related to diet. Americans consume large amounts of unhealthy foods and develop co-morbidities. When you have a high fast food/sugary diet you will get obese, develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease. That is the leading cause of Americans dying younger. There has been a huge push in healthcare to move toward population health. Population health focuses more on the social determinants of health. 

The social determinants of health show that only about 10% of your health is attributed to healthcare, 30% to genetics, 20% to social and environmental factors, and finally with 40% being individual behavior. 

The US has focused on episodic care. In other words when you have a problem you go get it fixed. This is only a temporary solution. The entire culture of American needs to shift toward living a healthy lifestyle. Health is not made with a trip to the hospital but over a lifetime of proper eating and exercise. 

American healthcare is so expensive because Americans utilize it so much and because we want it now. Other countries have to sacrifice in some way or another. For instance Canada has long wait times because your put on a list like everyone else and they will get to you when they do. The barrier to entry is time. The American barrier to entry is cost for the most part. However people who don’t have insurance still get treatment through the emergency department but it is again only episodic care. No follow up. This is very expensive also because treatment in an emergency department is far more costly than care through a primary care physician.  Other expenses come from the demand for latest and greatest technology. Technology actually makes healthcare more expensive. New technology and research provide new treatments for new problems. This expands and further specializes the system. 

I would suggest reading a lot of articles on the subject. No one article has all the answers. It’s a very large and complex system and complexity itself adds costs. 

I hope this was informative. A good book I suggest reading is Being Mortal. 

Also it’s what the insurance companies negotiating with employers and hospitals that result in the price of healthcare. "

You act as if old people are just begging to privatize Medicare and Social Security. And x-rays, a doctor visit, and a cast don’t cost under $100 at a clinic. How do I know?

healthcare,"Couple of points 

We are looking for an overall difference between cause and effect. If it was health, costs would fall roughly along health:

http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aX9SCmdMypQ/Tu7GvDfJHMI/AAAAAAAAASQ/aLOgca_A8Cw/s1600/Percentage-of-Obese-Population-by-Country.jpg

Costs look more like this, and the difference formed over 40 years ago:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/08/this-chart-is-a-powerful-indictment-of-our-current-healthcare-system

The basic cause is structural.  We are huge fans of capitalism so we naturally assume that the free market can do everything well. But the free market can only function when customers have choices/options and the time and space to select from them. 

Certain markets, like roads, schools, electricity, broadband and hospitals lack choices. Without which, customers can’t hold vendors accountable so the free market doesn’t work. Comcast wouldn’t be the most hated company in the nation if customers could switch to alternatives that have better service for less cost.

Private healthcare is focused on a single (profitable) population: healthy employed people between 20 and 60. Everyone else gets left behind, so we’ve public built system after public system to fill in the planet sized holes. Including Medicare, for people who have spent whole careers paying into private systems that now pay nothing for their care. As a result we already spend as much per person in public money on healthcare, then more than that on top in private care. 

Implementation won’t be easy but we don’t need to design a new system from scratch. The world is full of systems that work better than ours. We need only choose one."

I quit smoking completely within 2 weeks (I smoked some and vaped some--half and half--for the first 2 weeks). I haven't smoked since. It wasn't only painless, it was liberating. I think with the new nic salts the switch will be even easier for people.

However, you may be able to tell the doctor / therapist upfront that you have a HDHP and likely cannot pay the full amount out of pocket - is there anything in terms of payment plans or multiple payments that you can do?

healthcare,"The problem with healthcare is there are too many talks, and most of the decisions come from people who are not directly involved in healthcare.

The largest problem with healthcare is culture. Most people don't want to think about health. It's a last resort problem in their list. Rather than prevent conditions, they consume, consume, consume and don't plan for any unexpected problems, should they arise. This is easy when we are young, because we all feel so indestructible. Unfortunately it is that time frame that we also neglect our health a lot.

So unthinking young people, don't take health serious and are are not exposed to costs, due to the feeling they don't need care. We see care as fixing things, rather than preserving and maintaining. They pay for insurance, but don't use it, so they do not learn through experience.

Once care starts to become more routine, they are unexposed to the REAL cost of care, like ALL of us. How many times do we actually look at what the charges were for care? The insurance sends mountains of paperwork to us that don't really explain anything. Discounts, provider expected, actual, patient portion, deductible, premium, max out of pocket, etc......you get the drift. It's confusing as hell.

What they don't show you is the people that need to be paid salaries just to send the bills and collect them and process them and negotiate, and on and on. Bureaucracy. 

Now you obviously understand that a grocery store has to have food delivered to them from a middle man who gets the food from brokers, but what if the grocery store didn't accept cash from you at the register. What if they paid people to send you bills with certain codes. Then you paid someone to interpret the codes and verify they are accurate. Then you paid someone to research whether your food insurance plan covered all the foods and if so, how much. Then you paid someone to send money to the grocery store and they paid someone to accept money. 

Think how much money you would spend just having other people verify your grocery bill. It would be monstrous. Welcome to a majority of healthcare.

Insurance was conceived to handle catastrophic injuries which were unlikely and immersive. Now it's used whenever someone gets a sniffle or doesn't feel good. These primary care visits could be covered with cash payments for 1/3 of the cost if insurance were eliminated. Technology also would be much cheaper. MRI's and cat scans do not cost a fortune to have done because the machines are expensive, it costs a lot because of insurance. Without insurance, competition would correct the market. Instead competition is eliminated because nobody feels like they are spending their own money on healthcare. They think this magic ""insurance"" just pays for all of it. The more insurance pays for, the more premiums go up.

Thee are already models gaining steam to correct this insurance disaster (no....not single payer). Direct Primary Care Clinics do not accept insurance. You pay a monthly subscription fee (50-100 dollars a month) and get UNLIMITED care! Long appointment times. Corner pharmacies are also starting to offer fee for service flat rate care.

The best option you had now, if your company provides it, is the health savings account. Tax free money put into a health account. Couple that with high deductible plans and you may save a lot of money, if you're healthy.

Our culture needs to value their health more than going out to eat or iPhones. If people put that money aside for care, they may be able to craft a catastrophic insurance that is cheap. Major operations will always be expensive, and rightly so. It takes a lot of schooling to be a doc and with tort claims, the higher the risk of a lawsuit, the higher the cost is gonna be."

healthcare,"We have a medical residency bottleneck in the United States. Every year, more than 7000 U.S. citizens fail to match into medical residency position each year.  There are probably more than 7,000 to 30,000 total who are not accounted for that have not matched
No one will hire MDs/DO without a residency. This creates a surplus of US citizen physicians with defaulted student loans, over $300,000+ of student loan debt and an inability to work clinically or non-clinically in any capacity. 
Please stop allowing non-U.S. citizens to take the already scarce residency positions. The U.S. is unique in that it accepts foreign students before their own citizens. For example, The EU has the Schengen treaty and it works with their health and safety organization the HSE. These organizations put forth laws to ensure that EU students are selected first. This means that a direct-entry medical student who has barely passed, or failed a year in the EU, will be offered an internship before an international graduate-entry student who has come top of his/her class. Other countries such as Australia and Canada also choose their students first and then select from the foreign graduates once their positions are filled.  In the U.S., however, there is no legislation for this to occur.

Non-U.S. citizens immigrate to the U.S., become head of their departments, then proceed to favor and support foreign-born medical school graduates. The foreign-born medical students have an advantage over U.S. citizens because the USMLE allows them to take OUR medical boards in their home county where the standards are questionable. One-third of the U.S. medical residency positions are taken by non-U.S. citizens. 

Many foreign doctors take the USMLE in their home country and score 99 percent. This is a nine-hour exam administered only in English.  One of the hardest exams in the world and they are getting the highest scores. Testing outside of the U.S. allows cheating and score inflation. Please stop this practice. All residency candidates should take the USMLE in the USA to ensure that all the standards are the same.

healthcare,Thank you!
healthcare,"As someone who works in a hospital i feel like i should be obliged to answer. First, coats are going up for several basic reasons 1 an increase in the use of technology in care, which for every technology you use adds to the cost. That’s kind of explanatory so i won’t go into too much detail. 2. Am against population. The largest generation in the United States is entering the 65 and older range ( baby boomers) they are acquiring more chronic conditions, and generally will have declining health which leads to greater utilization which requires demanding the insurance companies and government to payout more money. 3 expanded coverage to people with more Co morbidies. Before the affordable care act insurance companies could deny coverage to individuals with high risk diseases because they would be too expense. Now it illegal to do that. Hence you have people with largely expensive chronic illnesses that require lots of attention and care getting access. Americans are also about demand. We want the highest quality and we want it yesterday. The fact that you can get a total hip replacement scheduled and done in less than a week is pretty much the only place in the world that can do it that fast.

In addition i just wanted to add, that the British system is not the cheapest. They have higher tax brackets and higher rates of taxes than we do which they use to fund a government run tax system. This system is great but the government has the right to refuse treatments if they are too expensive. For example if a man in his 80s wants a quadriple by pass and it will only extend his life two months, the government won’t pay for it. Whereas in American, shit of course we will. 

I could talk about this stuff for hours, so if you have specific questions feel free to reach out.

healthcare,"Here's a crazy idea.  Listen to the person who went to medical school, completed residency, and is a practicing physician.  Listen to your doctors regarding what your risk factors are, what tests you need, and what diet/exercise/drugs/therapies you need.  Don't walk in there demanding to have 'everything' checked out because you sound like a lunatic (meaning no offense of course, just trying to help.)  Blood tests aren't that helpful unless you already have an established baseline.  I'm surprised they even did that for you.

Just to be clear -- are you saying the physician **didn't examine you**?  That would be a little strange, considering a routine physical includes a PHYSICAL EXAM.  The way you described it as ""just a conversation"" aroused my suspicion.  It would be totally reasonable to request a full exam, skin check, etc because the physician may spot something (suspicious mole, lump on the neck, abnormal heart sound) that you wouldn't have noticed.  "
healthcare,"I can see your mission to equate quality with insurance companies. It's funny how CMS only pays 70-80% for govt insured services, yet they give insurance a 20% incentive. Shortcut docs and incentivise insurance.

I learned a long time ago that all those organisations that rate healthcare based on their holy grail of Crossing the Quality Chasm, are self serving good ole boys. Physician satisfaction and wellness is left out of the formula and only attempting to be addressed with the quadruple aim. These boards have the same good ole boys regurgitating the same nonsense that don't even practice medicine. It's like having someone who never played sports coaching a team. These groups rate providers based on unrealistic assumptions. Mainly, the assumption that providers are paid enough.

That is the number one problem in health care. There's not enough money! They throw money at all of these OTHER programs instead of just paying docs enough to see a manageable amount of patients a day. 7.5 minutes is enough time to ask how you're day is going. Until people realize that healthcare costs money and priorities need to be made, what good is asking if your doc taught you about your illness? They are NOT GETTING PAID for 75% of the work they do!

Take your job right now. If I inform you that the public is not happy with your job and now, you have to spend thousands out of your own pocket to get qualified to do your job AND we are going to give you four times as much work, AND you are not getting paid for more than 40 hours of work, even though it takes 80 hours to do your job, AND if you don't complete 80 hours of work every week (only paid for 40) then you are lacking in quality and your salary will be decreased or maybe you will lose your job, AND you are being judged by other people who depend on you doing 80 hours of work in 40 hours of time, AND you can be sued if you mess up......will you appreciate an outside panel sending out surveys judging whether you are quality?

There is no time to teach patients. There is no time to have a discussion with patients. There is barely time to treat the patient. Technology is destroying healthcare.

Physicians have two choices at practicing medicine.
1. Do not have a life and work non stop including weekends.
2. Do not chart properly and cheat the system.

healthcare,"It’s really easy to say we need Medicare for all because some have the view that this is a true single payer system that has large networks and removes insurance from the administration cost burden. Also provides large networks of doctors, “go see anyone” and not pay any co-pays or deductibles...


That would be incorrect.

For Medicare to work, you need an ancillary insurance policy to help cover cost. 

Medicare works in different parts. The part that everyone pays into as employees is Part A. Part A covers hospitals. Part B is $134 per month and every senior pays for this unless they are low income. Part B pays for doctor office visits and las. But wait... there is more.

This is only to cover 80% of the medical cost. Contrary to popular belief and most politicians, Medicare is a 80/20 plan. For example, if you have a $1000 medical bill, you, the patient, would be responsible for $200 of that direct cost. Why don’t you hear of seniors going bankrupt with high medical bills...

Most seniors have either a supplemental/ medigap plan or a med advantage plan. These are insurance policies. These plans vary in price and benefit, just like a standard insurance plan works. They also cover prescription drugs. 

A funding point is the Medicare Trust Fund will be bankrupt in 2031, so at some point these benefits are going to need to decrease and/or cost increase for all seniors or tax payers.

So, my last point, do you know how much taxes will need to be raised to afford what a Medicare for all type plan? It’s a lot. I think best estimates is a 7% employer payroll and a 4% federal income, plus a 3% high income. Remember that is best estimates and the rand foundation a few months back estimated a net 17% tax on all households to cover a true single payer no direct cost plan. 

Still sound good? "

healthcare,"I do agree that this is a step in the right direction, but what OP is saying is what will make this challenging and likely confusing.

For example, a knee replacement at my hospital is charged $70k for the procedure. The hospital down the street (literally ~5 mi. away) charges $50k. 

When it is all said and done and the charges go through the revenue cycle and get passed through the contracts the hospitals have with certain payers you are going to end up with a reimbursement that is likely fairly close to one another.

If we start by posting the original charge information (not what is actually being paid), which hospital would you go to?

Transparency isn't a new thing. IIRC University of Utah has piloted this idea almost a decade ago. But, to get to the next level of ""actual"" cost vs ""charged"" cost it is going to be a massive task. One I think the industry needs to tackle, but a very challenging one. "

After a botched back surgery in the military ended my military career, I relied on the VA for pain management, and did just fine for a decade, even going on the have a successful career as a surgical tech, on my feet assisting brain surgeons for 12 hours at a time.  

That all ended when the VA instituted the ""Opioid Safety Initiative,"" based largely off the CDC's so-called ""guidelines.""  My life the past three years has been a nightmarish hellscape of pain and poor treatment, not to mention no longer being able to work as a surgical tech. 

 I'm one of the fortunate ones, having not killed myself like so many chronic pain sufferers are doing now to escape their uncontrolled pain.

healthcare,"If it were the case where the legislation provides fee negotiation power for insurers, then yes it would go the opposite. This is not what was proposed in the article though:

""The California proposal would give a new state board authority to regulate the prices that health insurance plans charge for anything from a doctor visit to a knee replacement. It would use Medicare prices as a baseline, setting prices as a percentage of what the federal program that covers elderly Americans currently charges.""

This will regulate the prices charged by insurers to consumers at the point of sale to what appears to be elderly americans only(?). I see your point that if this does go in, private insurers still have the ability to lower the physician fees within their contracted networks to maintain their coverage risk and possible profits during the next contract negotiations. I don't have a lot of experience with a mixed coverage systems since I work in an environment with a public insurance plan. But if providers do behave what is expected of a free market, they will explore options for insurers that will provide similar fees that they expect to receive from insurers. This is regardless if it is provided by a public or private insurer. 

The proposed legislation attempts to normalize fees to be the same regardless of insurance type. I expect prices for services deemed medically necessary to be affordable as dictated by the set fees. I wish I could read exactly what they propose and see what the intended purpose is as well as possible unintended consequences are. This will be an interesting case study since it is rare to see explicit price control in healthcare. "

healthcare,"I have worked mostly with Medicaid MCOs, and long story short, the MCO makes more money when they reduce inpatient stays and ER visits. Inpatient stays and ER visits are the costliest type of healthcare for members to consume. And MCOs receive a flat amount per member per month (per cohort). So the MCO is spreading their risk across all lives they manage, and even if they can reduce IP and ER utilization a little, this will increase their bottom line. 

MCOs attempt to do this by encouraging people to see their doctor regularly (the thinking is issues will be caught earlier and the doctors can do something about the issue before it worsens to the point of treatment in a IP/ER setting). 

Also, MCOs will more actively manage high utilizers. First the MCO will use claims records to find members who have a high number of IP/ER visits (or they’ll find people with chronic issues that need to be actively managed) and then the MCO will assign case managers and care coordinators. Those people should be helping to manage the patient. They also might assign the members to a Medical Home and/or a Health Home. 

Hope this helps. "

Research Direct Primary Care clinics in your state. There may only be a few, but they are the future. You pay a subscription price (normally 50-100 dollars) per month, EVERY month. 

It may sound like a lot, but it is 100% worth the cost. What they do is cut out insurance. Insurance takes up 2/3 of the price of healthcare. Getting the subscription price EVERY month keeps them afloat. What you get in return is LOOOOONG appointments that are SAME DAY! You get cheap affordable prices for any labs or basic scripts you need. A lot of times you also get the docs cell number for 24/7 service. Think of having an hour to go to get your health instead of the 7.5 minutes insurance companies pay for now. Physicians WANT to take more than 7.5 minutes, but insurance companies refuse to pay them more.

You can also get a heads up on a county health clinic. They normally adjust pricing to your financial position.

Whatever you do, don't neglect your health. As bad  as it sucks, it's worth paying for. Until you get a new job with insurance, I would avoid any dangerous activities.

healthcare,"Ahhh i see, so insurance companies wouldn’t exactly buy the service or product they would just add it peoples coverage options. So inherently yes they would pay the startup for providing a service. However, with new innovative types of care deliveries or treatments of care insurance companies are very hesitant to cover them because they are new and they can be risky. Typically you’d have to partner with a hospital to perform pilot tests and present that evidence to insurance companies so that they can agree to cover the service or not. It’s a similar process to clinical trials. 

As far as what they could charge it depends on the results of those trials and how much money it could save the insurance companies. Typically with money saving ideas they can either do profit sharing incentives or charge rates similar to what they charge for EMT services currently. There are a ton of variables to consider with setting this sort of price but it seems like a potential huge opportunity for the company if it gets accepted by insurance. 

Hope this helps."
healthcare,So that doesn't address the shortage?
healthcare,[deleted]
healthcare,"Jesus. Where do I start?

Private health delivery systems, which includes most of the United States, Canada, Taiwan, and Germany, are generally made up of for-profit companies that naturally seek to make money. However, other developed countries institute ways of controlling prices for a product that consumers cannot decline when in demand (in other words, you’ll pay any price for someone to treat you if you’re about to die).

Such price controls can be direct, where the government tells doctors and hospitals how much to charge like in Japan, which is also called an all-payer system in the U.S. The government can also pool market power by allowing only one health insurer and using their influence to control prices, which is what many countries practice. This is called single-payer in the U.S. and is very effective. If price negotiations break down, a doctor or hospital could lose an entire market of customers. If the single payer only covers one type of hip replacement, for example, manufacturers will attempt to offer the best price for the money and a damn good product too.

Americans, however, are used to a multi-payer system. Doctors, hospitals, and drug companies can charge as much as insurance companies and consumers will bear because market power is so thinly spread. Treatment quality tends to be worse and the nation’s average life span is shorter compared to other countries that are popularly demonized for different systems, such as Canada and the U.K. The introduction of deductibles has made the market environment even worse for individual patients, since it further discourages health insurers from negotiating down prices of less costly procedures, such as specialist visits and exams.

That being said. I agree with you the system needs to change. I believe we will switch to a single payer system soon if we cannot solve the value based healthcare model beforehand. 

Making the switch to a single payer system if that does occur will fix some issues and create new ones. It is not hard to find issues with NHS or any other program either. 

Life expectancy is used as a proxy to measure quality of healthcare even though it has very little to do with it.  The number one thing Americans could do to increase their life expectancy is eating right and exercising. A side effect would be that it would lower the demand for healthcare and eliminate a lot of diseases/comorbidities. I agree this is not the “solution” but it would do more to improve the general longevity and quality of life of Americans than what any healthcare system could do. 

Again though there are many things that contribute to the cost of healthcare. For every one we solve the more affordable it will become. Good conversation though. You do bring up good points.

No one will hire MDs/DO without a residency. This creates a surplus of US citizen physicians with defaulted student loans, over $300,000+ of student loan debt and an inability to work clinically or non-clinically in any capacity. 
Please stop allowing non-U.S. citizens to take the already scarce residency positions. The U.S. is unique in that it accepts foreign students before their own citizens. For example, The EU has the Schengen treaty and it works with their health and safety organization the HSE. These organizations put forth laws to ensure that EU students are selected first. This means that a direct-entry medical student who has barely passed, or failed a year in the EU, will be offered an internship before an international graduate-entry student who has come top of his/her class. Other countries such as Australia and Canada also choose their students first and then select from the foreign graduates once their positions are filled.  In the U.S., however, there is no legislation for this to occur.

Non-U.S. citizens immigrate to the U.S., become head of their departments, then proceed to favor and support foreign-born medical school graduates. The foreign-born medical students have an advantage over U.S. citizens because the USMLE allows them to take OUR medical boards in their home county where the standards are questionable. One-third of the U.S. medical residency positions are taken by non-U.S. citizens.

If you didn't have a problem and it was just a checkup there should be no copay.  I'm not sure how it even got paid by your insurance without some sort of medical diagnosis.  Maybe call the billing office and see if they will rebill it as a preventive visit.

Honestly if your Pediatrician never billed your parents for their copay, it's possible they were just ""writing it off"", meaning they accepted whatever the insurance paid and didn't actually bill your parents for their portion.  This is technically a violation of their payer contract, and it certainly isn't typical.  If the Pediatrician knew your family well or if someone in your family was a doctor or something, sometimes they will write off the copay as a ""professional courtesy"" however that trend has gone from very common 20 years ago to almost extinct today."

Although we respect a patient’s autonomy and strive to deliver quality and culturally competent care, it isn’t always possible for our patients to be happy with certain diagnoses, medical management, or prognoses. 

I have been assaulted by patients with dementia but honestly was lucky enough to barely remember it. I have been threatened multiple times by both patients and family members about “that pain medication that starts with a D and is the only thing that works” when I was attempting to chart the patient’s self-reported lack of relief from oral pain medication and page the attending physician for more orders. The worst was by a patient who also worked in the same system they were a patient in and purposely called family in to follow me around and follow me to the parking lot because I was perceived as rude when I told the person the doctor did not order what was desired.  Security was called, but management did nothing to back us up. If there was a strict zero tolerance policy for this behavior, family members especially, then maybe behavior would improve and healthcare staff would be assaulted and threatened less."

healthcare,"The difficulty with the right-to-try legislation is finding the right balance. About 75% of Americans die in hospitals.  30% of admissions are for the terminally ill, people who WILL and are going to die.  

With that said, 85% of Medicare bills are funded by the government and there are almost zero efforts to understand or reign in these costs.  Terminal patients have a metaphorical blank check for treatment that has no guarantee of benefitting them but, 46 million Americans can't have health insurance. 

But who would dare tell someone that they will not do more to help them?  What doctor would tell their patient that they can't do any more because a financial threshold was left? What kind of super-egalitarian family would be needed to agree -""our dad will die in a few hours, we will take him home and free up this $10k/night ICU bed?""

The right-to-try legislation has to find a delicate balance of providing care, ensuring innovation, and doing so within acceptable costs...."

I’d look into the gloves they’re having you use as well. when I started in the ICU and everyone was on contact precautions (as opposed to the ER, where anything more than standard precautions weren’t initiated unless we knew of a risk based on complaint history or a previous resistant infectious agent), I found myself having a reaction to the gowns - my arms would get red and puffy wherever exposed to the gown. we also used chlorhexidine based handwash, so I could have been experiencing a sensitivity to that. ultimately I didn’t have to do anything with it - the redness would subside a few hours after my shift and eventually I stopped reacting. but, as another commenter mentioned, I would contact employee health and let them know. if need be they can arrange to have special gloves or soap for you depending on the source of the reaction. on your off hours I’d definitely find a good moisturizing lotion and use it every time you wash, and even a thicker nighttime lotion to really absorb. some OTC medicated brands are better than others, so maybe employee health will have some recommendations for you when you let them know. sorry you’re peeling so bad, looks annoying at best and painful at worst ��"

healthcare,"I know someone who over utilized their primary care. Over utilization can lead to over treatment. All he did was up or add medications. The pc doctor raised the patient's high bp medications, added a water pill while patient already on a drug that helps lower bp. They also added other medications that gave them bleeding ulcers all with in the same 1 year span. All to make the numbers comeout right. Point being they fainted &amp; fell from low blood pressure and haven't been right since. The recovery time killed their fitness &amp; motivation. The stomach ripping medication caused bleeding ulcers and aspiration pneumonia. In less than a year with multiple hospitalizations and numerous outpatient tests and follow up I'd say almost $600K spent on the patient that was over medicated and treated with regular trips to their primary care.

PC visits need to be education and options as much as anything. And it must be emphasized the patient must work at their health. There is not a pill or procedure for everything. "
healthcare,"First and foremost, have your mom create an account and fill out an application at Healthcare.gov to see what she qualifies for. If her Eligibility Notice (which is generated immediately after completing the application) doesn't mention eligibility for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP), then call 1-800-318-2596 and ask them to go through the list of SEPs that are not automatically granted through the application (there about 20 of them). The representative may skip out on telling you some of them because they intuitively know she won't qualify based on certain circumstances/records they have/don't have on file for your mom. 

As an example, if your mom lives in a state that hasn't expanded it's Medicaid program and she can verify that she's newly eligible for APTC (Advanced payments of the Premium Tax Credit) as a result of a recent increase in income, then she would be allowed an SEP to enroll in coverage with the next available effective date. "
healthcare,"Ok. So think of it in 2 jars that your putting water into. So you have a deductible which is when you owe 100% of the of the money. So once that jar is full the insurance company kicks in and pays percent and you pay the rest. So it can range from 80% insurance company 20% you to 50/50. So once this portion kicks you you’re filling the rest of the jar up till you hit the magical Max Out of Pocket amount. This means that from that point on the insurance company is picking up the tab. 

So for example  you get hit with a 10k hospital bill. If you have a 2000 Deductible. 80/20 split, and a 5k Max Out of Pocket.

You’ll end up paying 2k right up to meet the deductible. And then 1600 which is the 20% of the 8k that remains. So this means that of your 5k Max Out of Pocket you’ve filled 3400 and if you get any more bills that year you’ll still be paying 20% until you finish paying to remaining 1600.

healthcare,"Overuse or over treatment in many cases. Exactly. 

America being the most medicated country in the world but not the 'healthiest' should tell people that. And access to technology especially in hospital leads to over testing. More emphasis needs to be placed on the physical symptoms and numerical values on various conditions instead of a battery of tests many of which are simply cover your butt tests if not revenue generators.

Also the lack of upfront fully disclosed pricing leads to overuse because somebody else usually pays for it ie the insurance industry. If patients had to pay more out of pocket and providers rely on patients paying them over use would start slowing down. "

healthcare,"That’s not accurate, GoodRx provides price comparisons and let’s the patient decide where to purchase a needed rx for an affordable cost. Insurance companies pre negotiate rates to benefit the insurance provider.   

Many insurance companies also have their own pharmacy which they try to steer you too. Pre negotiated rates for many drugs always just happen to be a little less from the insurance pharmacy then the competition. None of these pre negotiated rates touch the prices of good rx or in some cases out of pocket cost.

Insurance companies and providers need to be required to show the transparency of the negotiated costs and what is actually be paid. "

The free market doesn't work when everyone isn't on the same playing field.

A single trip to the ED will cost thousands in personnel time alone, never mind the fixed costs of the facilities. If you only pay when you are sick, nobody will ever be able to afford the expertise needed to cure disease. Free market healthcare is a fantasy that has never worked and never will.

healthcare,"Hello throwaway10061984 (almost confused you with throwaway10061948!),

It really depends on what that $45 dollars gets you. Depending on your situation, I'm guessing that's a high-deductible health plan that will really be getting you only catastrophic (think, major surgery or cancer) coverage. Routine things like checkups/physicals or medications will require you to pay out of pocket until you hit your deductible. 

Essentially, you'll want to look at the benefits in terms of deductible, coinsurance, and co-pays. The deductible is the out-of-pocket max that you'll need to hit in order for the insurance company to start paying any money. Coinsurance is any amount you'll be liable for after you hit your deductible. Co-pays are flat fees for obtaining services, again, after you hit your deductible.

If you're okay with those benefits, then go ahead and sign up for the plan. I'm not an insurance pro, so you might want to verify this with your state's exchange. There should be agents who can help via phone. "

healthcare,"Perhaps your customers pay for your services directly.  You can't transplant that mindset to medicine as practiced in the USA unless you are talking about the 0.1% who pay cash for their healthcare.

Access to care in the USA is determined by insurance.  If your insurance plan doesn't contract with a particular Physician/Hospital/Imaging Center/Laboratory, you can go there, but you will get a large bill when they deny payment (out of network).  As a result, referral networks and insurance plans are getting tighter and tighter.  You realistically can't go to &lt;random imaging center&gt; and ask for an MRI.  The insurance company will often refuse payment because a prior authorization wasn't obtained, or the center is our of network, or an appropriate referral was not performed...  

95+% of the time, the physician that requested the examination will refer you to a place that your insurance will cover as a courtesy to you.  However, this isn't your ""choice"", in so much as its a place that your insurance will cover.  

Occasionally, people will shop around if they have a high-deductible-health-plan, but even then, they are realistically limited to a set of places their insurance will pay for.

Health care will be doing customers a favor when their satanic relationship (hyperbole for dramatic effect) with paperwork is eliminated, and when either costs come down or value delivered for cost paid goes way, way, way up. Right now customers are largely dis-intermediated because we're not in charge of the money: it's largely hidden between insurance and the doctors and their employers.

Let's keep that feature and not return to the hang around gossip outlets they used to be, while patients waited. A Hamilton hospital cut ER wait times to about 35 min, a decade or so ago, just by asking ER docs to see patients in 35 minutes. It's just a change of custom, but politicians need to also realize that inappropriate use of ERs must not be encouraged. For example, many on ODSP and many needing dental care, go to ERs for painkillers when budgeting for ODSP recipients to have a small over-the-counter drugstore credit each month, and for the needy to have basic annual dental coverage, would be a good investment to cut down on ER abuse, and improve public health, while not increasing medicare costs. Ditto for nurse practioners. About 2/3 of those in the ER need a nurse, not a doctor. Delivering the right care wold then save Ontario a bundle, and cut wait times. Further, why doesn't Ontario have 24-7 nursing stations at clinics or even in hospitals that anyone can visit? Why must everyone go through an ER?"

healthcare,"Your comments are interesting, but you miss a lot of medical and hospital waste. If 40-year-olds had access to non-medical specialists who could prevent oxidative processes that expedite aging, organ system failures, cataracts, etc., there would be a dramatic drop in treatments, organ failures, etc., and if you use non-medical experts to prevent high cholesterol and psychologists to treat the emotional neglect and adhd, etc. behind much obesity, you greatly reduce cardiac disease down the line and many cancers, all of which then greatly reduce the need for treatments, cutting healthcare costs, and death rates, markedly, allowing people to pay taxes longer while costing healthcare much less.

As for people being transferred too quickly from long term care homes, to its credit, the Wynne gov. has already identified this problem in a certain percentage of homes. I favour any transfers that would help the patient, but many of these transfers do not help. I think we need really positive environments for the elderly, and that this would improve quality of life and lower medical costs as well.

Your point about cataract surgeries is well taken. Why hasn't Ontario done more to cut these fees, which of course, must be calculated with time needed to perform the procedure, in mind. Further, new technology allows cataracts to be broken up for easy removal, yet patients are being subjected, still, to harmful treatment when the new standard is only implemented for those able to pay $2,500 and up, out of pocket. This is wrong. OHIP needs adjust fees downward as the new procedure is easy, faster still, and very safe with very fast patient recovery, and make this the ONLY standard of care for all. Forget extra-billing here. And let's help people prevent cataracts by sending them, by early middle age, to non-medical specialists with the knowledge to do it - I think this means naturopaths. (I know Canadians have been conditioned by the medical lobby and the CBC to imagine all alternative practitioners are quacks,  and they point to many news stories, but we need to remember that all of the health sciences, including and especially medicine, have ridiculous past procedures and wonky beliefs. We must get beyond mindless enslavement to medical views and view all healthcare with clear eyes.  

I think the new cataract procedure breaks up cataracts in a similar fashion as it used with kidney stones.

We also have too many outmoded treatments that don't work, such as knee replacement on the grossly overweight, a prescription for more harm. The main prescription for knee and hp pain should be to lose 30 pounds first, as weight is usually the problem, and surgeries are not a cureall, indeed, knee surgeries, for example, apparently restrict the range of available motion, permanently. Not an easy fix at all."

healthcare,"Hi Jacblr.  Physician here. The reason we have you fill out a blank medical release of information form is to more easily allow us to access your medical records from other hospitals and clinics.

For example. I am a pediatric Gastroenterologist. If I have a patient that comes to my office for abdominal pain and I think the child might have something more serious like inflammatory bowel disease, I would like to be able to request the medical records from your primary care provider. I'd like to know if you have had weight loss (by looking at your growth chart) inflammation by looking at your sedimentation rate or c reactive protein or even your albumin levels. I'd also like to review with a radiologist any imaging your physician may have already done. 

This will help me understand your disease process easier, prevent me from reordering unnecessary test, possibly establish a line of communication with your primary care doctor and lastly allow me to move forward with an endoscopy and colonoscopy quicker to potentially put my patient on the best treatment faster.

I understand the right to privacy for patients but sometimes it is very frustrating all the hoops physicians have to go through just to get information to provide the best care for our patients. We need single payer (and more importantly a single EMR desperately).

healthcare,"I can't speak for states that run their own SBM (State-Based Marketplace) but if she lives in one of the states that uses the FFM (Federally-Facilitated Marketplace) then you would use what's called the Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). 

If your parents are married the year they're applying for coverage they would have to indicate that on the application and would be required to file a joint Federal Income Tax Return for that Tax Year in order to qualify for and claim any Tax Credits. Household income is used in the FFM, so it would be both parents and anyone (if any) that they claim as a dependent on the return.

As for Income Verification, keep in mind that whatever income estimate they provided on their application was automatically compared to what sources like the IRS/SSA/etc have on file for them for previous years. The fact that your parents are being asked to provide income verification (again, assuming a FFM state) means that the two amounts differed by more than a predetermined acceptable threshold. 

Whatever documents they provide will again be compared to the estimate they listed on their application, so if the amounts differ because they expect an increase/decrease from the previous year, it may be beneficial to include a letter of explanation to explain why the amounts differ. "

My future “routine annual visits” should not require a copay due to officially falling under the H&amp;P category for preventative services.

Also, I’m pretty sure general internists aren’t technically considered specialists? Although internal medicine is a “specialty” you can choose to pursue in medical school, I don’t think it’s considered a specialist unless IM doctors have subspecialized into cardiology, endo, etc.

So, your insurance pays nothing until your deductible as met. After that they normally pay 80% - leaving 20% for you. The max out of pocket usually excludes copays - so once you have paid the max out of pocket amount in the form of 20% payments - the insurer covers in-network costs at 100%. Most plans have totally separate banks for in and out of network - so you still have to be diligent. Authorizations may still be required too.

healthcare,"Consults are a different kind of visit than say a routine scheduled visit.  Insurance companies have calculated that consults tend to be more expensive, so to shoulder less of the financial burden, they shift some of the price to you in the form of a co-pay.  Unofficially, this is also a conditioning tactic, as people who have to pay for their medical care tend to use it with more discrimination.  

Providers may also prefer a co-pay because they receive cash up front and a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.  Medical care is costly, and as many people rely on credit cards or structured payment plans to pay medical expenses this can draw out the reimbursement of the internist who needs money to continue to function.  So a $30 payment up front acts as a bridge until your insurance company fulfills their part of the payment.

Does that help?"

A large portion of the opioid epidemic is directly related to patient satisfaction, because patients expect and demand to be pain-free.

Case in point:  If someone is scheduled for a PETCT, they can't eat for 6 hours ahead of time, or the study has a high chance of being non-diagnostic.  With the ""customer"" mentality, people are more apt to just scan them anyway, collect the bill, and the patient is out the money for a useless exam.  If we keep the relationship as a ""patient"", we will go against their stated desire of scan today because we want the best quality scan for our actual customer, the referring physician who needs a proper examination."

healthcare,"I saw this and another home care horror story. Home nurse mistreats 4 year old.

https://www.doh.wa.gov/Newsroom/2018NewsReleases/18040ColburnDanielleHMNASuspensionNR

I think home health care has a lot of potential and many feel it's the future because for certain things it's cheaper than a hospital stay or office visit. But there are many things to be worked out including the proper vetting of the medical workers who want to do home care and it should it include their driving ability, customer service skills and in particular ensure there are no drug addicts or alcoholics. Along with being a self motivator and highly organized. Some employees with bad habits and attitude can get away and/or work in a group and structured setting, that employee should not be on their own see patients in their homes.

Home care workers should be a cut above the rest. They will be unsupervised and on their own to make their own judgement calls and perform procedures in a variety of conditions and on different kinds of patients.  

After some experience with home care and it leaves a lot to be desired. It's not a convenience when the patient could be driven or transported to a facility in less time it takes for the appointment window they are giving patients. There were weeks with multiple visits where 8-12 hours were lost waiting for these workers to show up. Then some of them can't drive(or walk) and/or are very picky about their parking  or have damaged private property. A clinic type set up would be much quicker for follow up type care and might be cheaper than trying to dispatch a ""fleet"" of home care workers. Some workers were extremely thorough and detail oriented others skipped half of their mandated tasks not even taking the blood pressure readings they were supposed to.

Around here home care seems to be a dumping ground for long time employees trying to finish out their career waiting to collect their pension. Or those with attitude. You can smell it miles away. Many also like the concept of being unsupervised which can attract alot of duds. One physically looked like an addict or alcoholic, they simply did not look healthy at all along with acting like a zombie. Suspicions were right, did a quick background check and a dui/criminal offense came up. Had several take extremely short trips to the bathroom(checking medicine cabinets for drugs ?)

Home healthcare has a lot of potential but it needs work. And should be prioritized and set aside for those that can't get help or enough help at home. Or get transportation to an office. Many patients have regular access to family and friends to help and for transportation. Those that don't should get home care first. And again home health care assignments should be set aside for the best, not for a hospital or supervisor trying to dump their worst.  "

healthcare,"That’s an indictment on the physician then, not the study. Why add the diuretic? Were they retaining fluid? Was it due to a common side effect of what I presume to be one of their other bp Meds? Can just switch the medication. No one should ever add a NSAIDS without telling someone to take it with food and that it can increase the chance for acids. Any medication that can worsen acid production or weaken the body’s stomach lining should come with caveats and patient education. When medications, specifically bp Meds, are titrated upwards you have the patient keep a BP log and see what effect it’s having and where. You see what time of day they’re low. How low? What symptoms do they have when they dip low? If the doctor in your anecdote did none of these things then yeah it defeats the purpose of primary care. But in my experience, an educated and medically controlled patient can stay out of the ER and hospital admissions for years. "

healthcare,Medicaid
healthcare,"&gt; the reason I went for the non-minimum health insurance this year is because it's been about 8 years and I was wanting to visit the doctor this year.

Do you realize that since 2009 an annual physical is completely free to you? There is no copay, coinsurance, or deductible for an annual preventive visit.  Even today under the Aetna plan you posted above - those costs are for a ""sick visit"" and I'm guessing based on the price it's for a specialist.  But you can still see a doctor for a checkup."
healthcare,"I own a medical billing service that has a client that is out of network for everyone. We bill to the insurance company what our normal rates are, then we give the patient a cash discount. So, in this case, let's say we billed the insurance $250, we collect $150 from the patient, and that is reflected on the bill as well. The insurance comes back and tells us that $250 was applied to deductible, and that we can collect that from the patient. We don't, because we already collected the $150, and we are not obligated to collect what the insurance company tells us to collect as we are not in a contract with them. 

To be fair though, only a few insurance companies actually ""allow"" and process the full amount to the deductible. They still factor in their network discount, we are simply not obligated, under law, to take it, since we don't have a contract. Nor are we required to give a ""refund"" if the insurance company ""allows"" less than what we charged. Our patients are always fully aware of this. "

healthcare,"I’m not sure where cars come up in the conversation. Nobody said we shouldn’t focus on improving the value of care.

As for routine care, it is only routine when everything goes as planned. However, there are cases that don’t and you need to prepare for the worst case scenario every time. Furthermore, in the US we do not accept that some care is futile and spend more on end of life and futile care than anywhere else. We have to make up that cost on charges for the less sick to keep the doors open. We also spend a paltry amount on preventative care and social services that keep people healthy and away from expensive care.

As for deliveries, there is a lot behind those numbers from how we count infant mortality to the health of the population. Improving the health of mothers before they get pregnant and supporting them after they give birth would go a lot farther than any intervention at the time of delivery."
healthcare,"Flatiron Health looks very interesting. "
healthcare,"Thanks for your explanation! So at my next follow-up with my internist in a year, I should /not/ be expected to pay a copay since it is a routine H&amp;P office visit and not a consultation? "
healthcare,"it's going toward your deductible. the deductible is annual and once it's reached then the insurance starts paying a percentage (usually about 80%). there's another section on the website that lists your deductible amount and how much as gone toward it. it's also likely that everything goes to deductible including prescription drugs and urgent Care.

1. why are you going to such an expensive doctor?!?!

healthcare,"I don't think there's inherently anything wrong with referring to a patient as a 'customer'. There are, however, a few benefits to changing your orientation to this term... Customer service is a term most people are familiar with and it can have positive connotations when you're providing customer service rather than diagnostic care. 

Healthcare is also shifting from volume to value. In some cases, thinking of a patient as a customer makes this relationship a little more clear--they're here for a service and you're there to do your darndest to help their money go its furthest, even if they might not be paying it directly. 

I think it levels the playing field, too. Doctors are seen as superior to patient, at least when it comes to medical knowledge and all that. When a patient is a customer, 'the customer is always right' and what have you. 

The other side of it is that the patient can become more of a dollar sign or an asset rather than a human being. 

I'd say take the positives of thinking of patients as customers and combine it with the patient-centeredness that comes with healthcare territory."

They don't solve that many information gaps because they are always EHR or insurer specific so the patient still lacks a complete view into their medical record and patient's can't easily share data from their portal with a provider using a different EHR. To really realize their benefits we need to move towards a patient centered approach to data access where the patient always has an up-to-date view into the services they received regardless of WHERE they received them.

Think of all the people who don't push back and pay it and go into debt or people who are sick and the stress of a denial is the last thing they need.  I bet a certain number of valid claims are denied since they know some people won't put up much fight and just pay it.

We need a single payer system to put an end to the insanity that is health insurance.  Healthcare would no longer be tied to certain jobs, no claim denials after care, most all clinics/hospitals would be in network no matter where you travel, no preexisting condition worries and no one going bankrupt due to medical bills.  Most people will pay less per year than they do now compared to premiums and out of pocket costs and everyone would be included.  If you get laid off or change jobs you still have the same healthcare available.  I see much more freedom and work/life balance if we can get Improved Medicare For All.  Health insurance tied to work is used by companies to keep a lot of people under control, just the way they like it."

healthcare,"Hospitals, especially privately-held ones, are constantly under pressure to reign in costs by shareholders, politicians, etc. The root of this issue stems from America’s spiraling multi-payer system that spreads market power too thin across insurers. It’s no surprise that the lowest prices are usually given to Medicare and Medicaid patients, which delivers care at a lower cost and with very low overhead due to their large patient pool.

This is the way most other countries do it. Government intervention is inevitable in a market where the customer is willing to pay most anything to save a life."
healthcare,"A couple things that I'd like to point out here: the patients that you listed do not need naturopathy. They don't do anything for cancer treatment and if any medical doctor prescribes them to a naturopath, that's basically letting them die at the patient's own expense. Also, outpatient drug regiments for either preventative methods (ex. statins for CVD disease) or for treatments (ex. chemotherapy for cancer) are mostly out of pocket and not covered by the government. They are subsidized by private insurance mostly. There are government programs that can also subsidize your drug treatment plans if you meet their criteria for financial help.


The article states a ""ballooning"" healthcare spending issue but never mentioned the exact cost drivers outside of the ""aging population"" and elderly population in Ontario. This is simply not true. The biggest cost driver in the ontario healthcare costs are medical mistakes in hospitals overall. If you are looking at age-specific cost drivers then yes it is usally the ""frail elderly"" (quotations used since this isn't a strict definition but more of a collection of symptoms given to a person over the age of 65) that take up a huge amount of costs within hospitals. Whether these people should be in hospitals or in out-patient care is a matter of health value not of cost. Should these elderly patients have the right to treatment to keep them alive or to aid them to die peacefully? 



One thing I would like to see happen is changing certain physician fees when in negotiation with the OMA. Specifically the fee for cataract surgery should reflect the time spent and improvements in technology. The current fee reflects previous surgery 60 yesrs ago when cataract surgery was highly risky and charged the government 300 a patient and, due the the surgery taking 3-5 hours, opthamologist would do only do 2 carataract surgeries a day. Now, its up to 50 cataract patients since the surgery talking roughly 15 mins. The fee should be down to 50 a pop. Its ridiculous how much they make for a simple procedure now."

healthcare,"I get the feeling that much of the opposition to single payer (whether they'll admit it or not) is worry about ""others"" getting healthcare even if they aren't working.  If it could be proven to them that they would pay less per year for equal or better healthcare, some would still oppose it to keep it away from those ""others.""  Lots of problems with that including many people who aren't working already get healthcare through existing programs and will continue to, which non-workers should be exempted from a work requirement (minors, disabled, elderly, people caring for them) and the cost/complexity to regularly verify whether people are working or not.  Welfare/unemployment has work/job search requirements so who are all the people fully able to work but aren't?  I think only wealthy people could do that, not the people normally imagined by those demanding a work requirement.

Single payer would get the most people possible to contribute to the fund by including part-time workers and other jobs that don't offer insurance benefit, which is more and more common.  Keeping it tied to certain jobs gives companies more control over people.  I see more freedom in single payer, better work/life balance and possibly more jobs created by small businesses that wouldn't have to worry about health insurance anymore.

Ran across this article that was interesting and talks about people so worried about the ""others"" that don't work.

healthcare,"Hasta Yatağı Devlet Karşılıyor Mu
Ülkemizde hasta yakınlarının ve hastaların haklarını koruyan çok sayıda uygulama bulunmakla beraber bazı hastaların ve yakınlarının sıklıkla sorduğu sorulardan biri hasta yatağı devlet karşılıyor mu? Bu sorunun aslında birkaç cevabı var. Öncelikle hasta yatağı devlet karşılıyor mu sorusunun cevabı için hastanın nasıl bir hasta olduğu sorusunun cevabını vermek gerekiyor. Eğer hasta sürekli yatakta yatarak bakılması gereken bir hasta ise SGK bununla ilgili bazı uygulamaları devreye sokuyor.
 Hangi Hastaların Yatağı Devlet Desteği İle Alınabiliyor?
Hasta yatağının devlet desteği ile alınabilmesi için hastanın sürekli yatakta tedavi ediliyor olmasıdır. Ayrıca bazı hastaların hastanede sürekli olarak yatması mümkün olmadığından bu hastaların evde bakılması gerekmekte olup bu tür hastalar için devlet hasta yatağı teminini sağlıyor. Hasta yatağı devlet karşılıyor mu sorusunun bir başka olumlu cevabı ise yatalak ve engelli hastalar için verilebilir. Bu tür hastalar için devlet bakan yakınına bakması için maaş vermesinin yanında yatağın bedelini de karşılayabiliyor. Hasta yatağı devlet karşılıyor mu  sorusunun yanıtını merak edenlerin bilmesi gereken bir başka husus ise bu talebin nasıl yapılacağı konusu.
 Öncelikle hastanın hastalık derecesinin ispat edilmesi gerekiyor ki hasta yatağı devlet karşılıyor mu sorusuna olumlu yanıt alabilmek için bu belgenin devlete ait hastanelerden alınması gerekmekte. Ayrıca doktor tarafından yazılmış bu raporda hastanın yatağa bağımlı ya da az hareket edebilir durumda olduğunun belirtilmiş olması gerekiyor. Hasta yatağı devlet karşılıyor mu sorusunun bazı kısmi yatalak hastalar içinde bir cevabı bulunuyor. Devlet bazı hastalar için ise bu yatağın bedelinin bir kısmını karşılıyor. Kısaca özetlemek gerekirse hasta yatağı devlet karşılıyor mu sorusuna olumlu cevap alabilecek hastaların yatağa mahkum ya da kısmen hasta olduklarını belirten bir devlet hastanesi raporu almaları gerekmekte.
Hasta Yatağı Devlet Desteği İle Nasıl Temin Ediliyor?
Hasta yatağının devlet desteği ile satın alınabilmesi için devlet hastanesi raporunun mutlaka alınması gerekmekte. Fakat çok sayıda hasta yakının yaptığı bir hata da yatağı aldıktan sonra devlet desteği için başvurmak olup bunun yapılmaması gerekiyor. Çünkü raporla birlikte SGK’ya başvuruluyor ve sonrasında yatak devlet tarafından hastaneye gönderiliyor.

BPD definitely finds a lot of doctors way out of their depth, and I actually respect and am glad that at least the doc was up front about that. It’s a tough disorder that doesn’t respond to much, but that doesn’t ever mean you should ignore or leave a struggling person in crisis.

It may have been a bad judgment call.

One obstacle I see with the rise of all these new sources of really rich patient data is the difficulty of integrating that data into doctors' workflows. Even with EMR data today, doctors still struggle today to integrate EMR data that is shared from different vendors into their workflows. For example, CommonWell and Carequality both work to give doctors fuller visibility into their patients' other visits but because the data isn't entered into the doctor's own system and the doctor can't view that additional info when they look at a patient's chart, actually leveraging that new information can be difficult.

healthcare,"Yes they are like prisons, but they're terribly run and can be outfoxed. Just have to be clever. This is not something that is likely to be solved with politics, so I hesitate to put any energy into that arena.

What's needed is a robust outpatient care model focused on chronic disease(s). I built two clinics with a friend and only recently walked away due to severe partnership issues (ethics). I'm effectively unemployed and moving forward on the same thing in a different place.

For most people who read about healthcare, or even work in it, I can appreciate how dismal it seems to try applying business principles to the industry. That somehow what we have now is capitalism. What we have is capitalism when nobody gets competed with, which is basically a free for all. Everyone who participates in the industry of healthcare gets paid and nobody does anything to fix that. The consolidation in non-providers (insurers, pharmacies, pbm's, distributors) is not going to change that either.

What we achieved as two twenty-somethings in our first 18 months was considered impossible by the parties we encountered: insurers, other providers, pharmacies even (pain in the ass). Saved a fair amount of lives, and livelihoods. I bring up age because I think this is possible if people put their minds to it - we had almost no resources or help as just two hungry kids.

I guess what I'm getting at is: we need local systems to work well. And to inspire people that it is indeed possible. Some pockets in this country have it figured out, but the majority do not. Trying to fix a big problem and focusing on politics will end up keeping things a problem, as they have been for decades. Any discussion of insurance systems, coverage, eligibility, etc. sort of misses the point. It's like setting policy for a bunch of people digging a canal with spoons - instead of focusing on getting them shovels."
healthcare,"I don't go on reddit to discuss healthcare often - but I used to - and it reminds me of the days when I wasn't doing anything about it. Maybe too anecdotal of a rationale however. 

The things that fix healthcare as a system are not the same things that you'd study to show why it's broken. Much of this comes down to how you define the disease and also how to cure it - everyone seems to have a different complaint these days. Coverage, cost, access, quality... But I do know this: the system needs to consume more than perhaps even your soul for a dent to be made. Especially if you're focused on the entirety of the $3.X trillion we spend annually.

I also woke up sick and snarky, first thing I did was post that comment. Apologies."
healthcare,"Netherlands here, we have a quite fair and equal health care system. Everyone is obliged to pay for the system, how much depends on your insurance. The minimum amount you need to pay, when you have the most basic insurance, is around €100 each month.
However, even if someone did not pay for their insurance (and therefore the system) you will still receive medical care if needed so. So everyone has the right of receiving medical care independently of their economic status. 

Of course the system has some problems. The rising cost of the health care system is a big issue in the Netherlands. The risk with the system is that one day it can become too expensive to keep in effect. Another issue is the bureaucratic aspect of the health care system. A lot of doctors and other medical personal complain about the time wasted with bureaucratic work (perhaps even a red tape).


In my view those problems are not caused by the system itself. If we all started to finally live healthier, the costs will go down. If we spread out the money in this world more equally, their would be more money for the system. If we do something about the power of the drug manufacturers and their efforts to keep the prices of drugs high, their would be more money for the system.

healthcare,"Yeah completely agree. the suggestion that hospitals not be able to ask about insurance is ridiculous. How else can you figure out how to bill for all of those services the hospital provides? 

I think the post does get at the general confusion there is around pricing for medical services though. Until recently hospitals kept their pricing completely secret. Even now the charge master pricing lists that occasionally release have almost no bearing to an actual price for a service because each insurer is separately negotiating those rates. That adds this whole new layer of stress when you’re hospitalized because instead of just being able to trust the doctor to do the right thing you have to constantly worry about the bill that you’ll end up with. 

It’s that same pricing ambiguity that is unfairly creating that distrust of doctors and making patients second guess what the doctor is ordering. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy to address but by providing more visibility into pricing I think the doctor-patient relationship could go back to being focused exclusively on care.
"
healthcare,[removed]
healthcare,"You bring up an excellent point about price transparency.

The charge master is a terrible measure of true cost to the patient. Oftentimes the charge master is inflated to the highest amount any insurer will pay. The average reimbursement for a charge from the hospital is 45-50% of the actual charge. It’s a game that is played between insurers and hospitals. If the hospital bills below reimbursement, then they are leaving money on he table, so they have to charge high amounts to get the best reimbursement from the top payers.

Total cost of care is no longer only the price the hospital pays to care for you, it also includes loss of time from work, opportunity costs incurred, anguish, etc."
healthcare,[removed]
healthcare,"Right excellent points. I see why we originally let payers negotiate rates separately with each provider/hospital but it got us in this very interesting situation where there's no true price for anything because it's 1) often at the discretion of the payer and 2) each payer has their system for deciding payment for a given service. I wonder if there's a way to add some price transparency to the system while still allowing payers to contract rates. Even if payer specific rates for each service were publicly available, I could see the administrative burden of requiring a hospital to convey all that information to the patient as prohibitively high. 

I think if we want patients to continue paying higher and higher portions of their care we might need to rethink having each service's reimbursement be dependent on the specific payer. Just a thought. Very curious to hear other ways of increasing price transparency. "
healthcare,[deleted]
healthcare,"There is no difference in what is covered between plans. What is different is the % you pay monthly for insurance and then how much you pay for every visit with a doctor, procedures, and prescriptions. 
For example, you will pay more each month flat out to have a silver or above plan, but each office visit cost will be less. 
With a bronze plan, you will pay less up front monthly to have insurance, but when you go to the doctor it will be more expensive for a visit. 
Birth control is free under current healthcare law. Some states you can even get it without a prescription at the pharmacy (but in that case there may be a cost.)

I had a few personal experiences and can't really complain. I'll list a some:


1 - Born in a public hospital, mom had to get a c-section because I was in a bad position. No other issues, mom spent a day or two at hospital.


2 - had a nasty ear infection when I was a teen, went to public hospital, waited about 3 hours to see a doctor, was diagnosed and got a prescription. Went to the public pharmacy and got the medicine, all free of any charge.


3 - One of my best friends was in a car accident, he was critically injured (both arms broken, internal organ damage, etc.). Got treated at a free hospital for months, made a full recovery, didn't spend a dime.


4 - Mom had breast cancer a few years ago, surgery, chemo, etc. everything went OK and free. She paid just a R$ 1,000 (300 usd) extra fee because she opted to include a cosmetic reconstruction during surgery. But if I'm not mistaken the law changed and now even the cosmetic part is fully covered.

healthcare,"The reasons for this are a long list of corner cases. Here's two:

1. I traveled to Colombia last year, and needed a yellow fever vaccine. It was in short supply, so I had to go to a clinic that had it. They gave me a piece of paper with some details of the vaccination, but there was no way to update my PCP's records (which I don't even have access to). I would love for there to be a single source of truth for all of that. (The reason this is important is I had forgotten I got a typhoid vaccination 3 year ago, and I got vaccinated again. There was just no good record of it all.)

2. When I see a specialist, I have to re-enter every thing into paper forms (every past surgery, current symptom, personal information). Not only is it a frustrating amount of work for everyone, but it isn't even very good data! They won't have the same rich records of past medical issues."
healthcare," If you bring us your med list, surgeries, and whatever on a list you made my office won't make you write it on our form. We'll just pull it from your list. then you only have to fill out the parts you didn't have in your lists like why you're here today and signing the records release"
healthcare,"your out of pocket limit is an annual amount; not monthly. 

now why is the cost so high? because insurance companies actually pay a lot of money for care. it's worth all the effort to get the payments. 

lastly there is an issue with medicare and Medicaid. both pay very little but require lots of paperwork to get the money and combined cover 50% of Americans

healthcare,"there’s an iOS and Android app called iBlueButton which can ingest and securely store both human and machine readable data from an EMR. I use it and, besides the horrible UI, quite like it.

healthcare,"Actually... it’s entirely possible, just not very likely to work. The wonky bit is some regulations called Meaningful Use that, in various stages, required electronic medical records to be able to export and import files including patient data. 

Most modern EMR platforms can read in a file called a CCDA which is essentially and XML file with things like history, meds, procedures and identifying information. 

I carry all my CCDA files on a tiny usb drive on my keychain. I’ve tried at every doctor and hospital I’ve ever been to -including the institutions I’ve worked at which include some of the top names in healthcare world-wide -and I’ve never found a person yet who knows how to import the file. 

In fact, one office allowed me to come back behind the registration counter and try myself. Setting aside the massive HIPAA violation there, it was the only time I’ve seen a recent EMR where the feature was present but the office hadn’t paid to enable it. 

It’s still worth a shot! If you have a record from a doctor or hospital first check to see if they have an online portal. Sign up for it, which may require a call to the office for a specific code. Then look for the option to download your record. It may be called Blue Button or simply “download”. You should be able to get both a human readable file as well as an XML CCDA. "

Could also have different kinds of health insurance. So that if you don't take medicine or don't take that much you can have insurance just for emergencies. Make emergencies a requirement and medicine optional [to save money for people who don't go to the doctor as often as others]

healthcare,"Have you thought about how hospitals are forced to care for you even if you don't have insurance?

It's the flip side of being forced to have insurance. 

If we stop making people sign up, we should stop making hospitals care for freeloaders. Unless they can pay up front.

healthcare,"A lot of the technology isn't that hard to build. Maybe not superhuman surgeon robots, but things like predictive modeling, video conferencing for telemedicine, iphone extensions to take a picture of your sick kid's ear infection to text to the doctor, emailing your PCP about potential issues, etc. But without politics, how do we get to that ""future of healthcare""?

The market won't just drift that way naturally, since between hospitals, doctors, insurers, device makers, and pharma, there are too many competing special interests. Each player wants to make as much money for themself as possible. Even something as simple as sharing medical records between hospitals won't work without government intervention. Each hospital has its own fragmented software that doesn't communicate with other hospital EHRs by design, because if your records could seemlessly be sent hospital-to-hospital, then its easier for you (a customer who generates revenue for them) to leave them for a competitor. They don't like that idea. Also, if other hospitals could access your hospital's records, then they could poach the rare disease money-maker patients. Again, hospitals don't want that scenario, and they are not incentivized to change this.

Your insurance comapny would love you to get be healthier and need less medicine, because that means you cost less for them. But the fewer hospital services you use, the less money the hospital is now making. It's a zero-sum game.

To summarize, government and politics are needed solve our healthcare problems, because the various players are in a gridlock of special interests. We can debate whether the ACA was the right approach, but I don't think one can reasonably assume that market forces alone will take us to an era of homeostasis. "

healthcare,"My favorite way to solve problems is to look at all the possible causes, eliminate the ones that can’t be, then see what best matches the effect I’m trying to reduce 

1) look at this graph
https://www.reddit.com/r/healthcare/comments/5zi1kr/this_one_chart_shows_how_far_behind_the_us_lags/?st=JCX8O2G0&amp;sh=7fc9a87e

2) one country doesn’t fit with the rest of the pack, something about that country is different from all the others. What could it be?

3) the UK is off with the cheaper group yet has many features close to the US, including poor food options and high obesity rates.

4) many other ‘likely’ factors are similar between the the US and UK, including aging boomers. yet year after year our costs are wildly higher.

5) one difference between every other country shown and the US, during every year that and other similar graphs show, is how healthcare is funded. 

They rely on a single pool of cash to pay for a single pool of care. While the US spends over a trillion dollars a year trying to prove that the free market is any good at delivering healthcare.


6) US employers are spending 19k per employee per year on healthcare. The average annual cost for healthcare is nearly 9k. If you’re in the us (part of this system) and paying much less than $700/mo, there’s only a few possible reasons:

A) someone is paying premiums for you

B) you premiums are subsidized

C) your coverage is incomplete 

D) someone else will pay when it’s needed 

7) ACA is expensive because us healthcare is expensive. We just used to have plans that were so bad, people went bankrupt when they actually needed it, pushing costs onto the system as a whole 

8) we don’t need to invent a solution. Every other country already figured this out. All we have to do is pick one and copy it."

healthcare,"Sadly it is all about the money. Still politics moves very slow whereas science and innovation can move pretty damn fast. "
healthcare,"Likely counterpoint:
But but but socialism "
healthcare,"Fair enough even though the comment you replied to did suggest having insurance for all and possibly set it up in a way in which everyone has to have it for emergencies [got shot, need a rabies vaccination, etc... (really expensive things)], but having it for medicine (perscriptions &amp; doctor visits) is optional [assuming this is realistic]. 

Otherwise if we can cut down on costs through science and technology along with more automation. Then hospitals picking up freeloaders wouldn't be as big of a deal. Also if you don't have insurance [even if you do, but the deductible is super high] you can apply for charity and they will pay off your hospital bill assuming you don't have that much money, or own anything of value [I would assume most freeloaders fit this category].

Also it would look bad if they didn't [pretty sure doctors have to sign some sort of agreement to help people in order to get their license could be wrong].

Still I actually didn't consider that (if my logic or response seems off let me know).

Thanks "
healthcare,"Before Obama's administration passed the HI-TECH Act to incentivize hospitals to adopt electronic records, most places were using paper systems. In 2008, only 9.4% of hospitals had what could be considered a Basic EHR (electronic health record). After billions of dollars of incentives, that increased to 75.5% compliance in 2014. Haven't looked for numbers in the last 3 years, but it's like that has gone up further since. 

But EHRs are not being integrated very well for many things, since the hospital workflow was built around a paper chart that physically got passed around to indicate ""okay, the patient is here, the nurse can grab the chart, see the patient, finish and then leave the chart for the doctor to see the patient is ready, etc"". With EHRs, one hospital started passing around a chart-sized piece of cardboard to use the old workflow, rather than a set of new protocols or procedures. These things take time to fix, and probably will need some nudging to make them work smoothly.

Also, another place politics comes into play is liability and/or malpractice lawsuits. If a patient has an unfortunate outcome, they or their family have tended to sue the doctor/hospital a lot more in recent years. This leads to an increased practice of ""defensive medicine"" where a doctor might ""cover their bases (i.e. cover their ass)"" by ordering a $16,000 MRI scan that might not actually be necessary, just so they can say they did everything they could to catch early signs of an illness. 


"
healthcare,"Not going to lie I'd prefer if health care was all under one roof (government). The only problem is that jobs will be lost if we did that also the health insurance companies are bound to fight against it [still if it means more affordable health care then I'm okay with that which is easy to say since I'm not working for any of those companies].

The free market is a good point. I actually forgot about having it all under one roof (assuming this can actually be done in a timely manner and we're dealing with politics and money probably not [still being done in the future is good I guess).

Still if people are dying from health problems that could have been prevented though eating healthier (not eating fast food, eating more salad) then we are wasting a ton of money. So eating healthier (baby steps) along with future science and innovation [also the new addition of healthcare being preferably under the government (if being under the government isn't good let me know)] could fix our problems. 

"
healthcare,"Man I didn't consider the lawsuits. Should probably have protections for that especially if you would get charged extra for a scan to prevent them from getting sued. Which more automation could mean less mistakes especially if a doctor/nurse ends up getting tired and making a mistake. Which from what I understand happens quite often which we are humans we are bound to make mistakes and hospitals get packed (the only problem is these mistakes will kill people, make them sicker, or cost them more money). 

Which more automation even if at first a robot working next to a doctor and making sure the patient gets the right medicine (also during surgeries to prevent someone getting cut wrong) could be a step forward in preventing unnecessary lawsuits due to human error.

Otherwise a lot of these problems will probably be fixed through science, innovation, and eating healthier it's just that like everything else it will take time. I more or less want to hopefully find a way to push this forward faster (social media)."
healthcare,"Often times, you don't need a big fancy robot to make a huge impact. Something as stupidly simple as a checklist before surgery DRAMATICALLY reduces the infection rate and the mortality rate. Having sure everything has been properly sterilized, making sure that there is sufficient blood units readily available in case the patient unexpectedly starts bleeding out, any allergic reactions to watch out for, verifying the patient name &amp; where the incision will be (e.g. right knee vs left knee), etc. There are a lot of little things like that which, as you mentioned, are sometimes skipped/forgotten. 

This [article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist) summarizes some of the studies that show how useful checklists for medicine can be:

- ""The results were so dramatic that they weren’t sure whether to believe them: the ten-day line-infection rate went from eleven per cent to zero. So they followed patients for fifteen more months. Only two line infections occurred during the entire period. They calculated that, in this one hospital, the checklist had prevented forty-three infections and eight deaths, and saved two million dollars in costs.""

- ""Within the first three months of the project, the infection rate in Michigan’s I.C.U.s decreased by sixty-six per cent. The typical I.C.U.—including the ones at Sinai-Grace Hospital—cut its quarterly infection rate to zero. Michigan’s infection rates fell so low that its average I.C.U. outperformed ninety per cent of I.C.U.s nationwide. In the Keystone Initiative’s first eighteen months, the hospitals saved an estimated hundred and seventy-five million dollars in costs and more than fifteen hundred lives. The successes have been sustained for almost four years—all because of a stupid little checklist.""

""The fundamental problem with the quality of American medicine is that we’ve failed to view delivery of health care as a science. The tasks of medical science fall into three buckets. One is understanding disease biology. One is finding effective therapies. And one is insuring those therapies are delivered effectively. That third bucket has been almost totally ignored by research funders, government, and academia. It’s viewed as the art of medicine. That’s a mistake, a huge mistake. And from a taxpayer’s perspective it’s outrageous.” We have a thirty-billion-dollar-a-year National Institutes of Health, he pointed out, which has been a remarkable powerhouse of discovery. But we have no billion-dollar National Institute of Health Care Delivery studying how best to incorporate those discoveries into daily practice.""

Until liabilities are better addressed, we will probably still have EHR systems that give warnings for every little potential harm (from ""these two medications might sometimes occasionally interact poorly"" to ""you are about to give a 39x overdose of medication to this patient""). All of these warnings cause alarm fatigue, and even though some warnings are WAY more important than others, manufacturers include them all because it's more legally exposing to NOT report a potential harm than it is to over-report potential harms, even if that means the nurse/doctor gets so overwhelmed by the alarms that they do a worse job catching medical errors."
healthcare,"These are broad strokes:

I think preventative medicine insurance should be mandated as a bare minimum like a car collision insurance. This way everyone takes advantage of preventative health issues because they are paying for it anyway so might as well take advantage of it. 

Preventative medicine = more people getting caught ""early"" on with population health issues such as diabetes, hypertension, psych and drug abuse and being able to change course in a preventative fashion (either through technology, smartware devices to track exercise, education about health eating habits, technology supporting this education, social support) all this pay for a mandated insurance. Everyone needs preventative medicine like everyone needs car insurance (if you drive, dah!)

Emergency medicine would be then be less used as a ""last resource"" for these type of diseases."
healthcare,"Actually never thought of delivery (so easy to miss and not consider). Also those numbers are huge just for a checklist. Still a problem would be nurses and doctors getting too stressed by having too many patients in a short period of time along with working 60 hour weeks (not always the case, but have known nurses and even some medical doctors (read their book) mentioning there being too much or working 60 hour weeks. Which you're bound to make a mistake working that much under those conditions.

I've also read about plane crashes because pilots get sensory deprivation (might not be the exact word) and even though alarms are going off telling them what to do they just can't focus and end up crashing the plane. So robotics isn't perfect, but if a robot could do open heart surgery and make it all automatic then there is potential for making mistakes almost 0 this would of course take time along with trial and error.

Was thinking about simplifying some medicines. As in using natural foods to fix some health problems instead of giving someone a perscription for a drug that does the same thing with side effects... Which that would require more research which needs to be funded and cheap natural foods makes less money than a patented drug."
healthcare,"It seems like most preventive medicine is just more perscription drugs as opposed to doctors giving us a diet plan. It's usually don't eat this, quit drinking soda, as opposed to what we should eat. Plus medical doctors get very little dietary training from what I've read. Still preventive would be amazing, but a lot of that can be accomplished by eating healthier (if only we could have a clear cut definition of this instead of new fads and diets coming out constantly). 

The way I view it is preventive=mostly dietary and lifestyle [I do have a bias against relying on prescription drugs in order to survive mostly due to personal experiences].

I'll end this by sharing my own personal experience which does shape my opinion s in regards to healthcare and doctors so notice I am biased.

So I had severe childhood asthma (when I was like 6 or something the doctor took my parents out of the room and asked if I smoked cigarettes [I didn't and my parents didn't btw]). I was told I would have asthma for the rest of my life don't exercise blah blah blah.

Got older started exercising started eating better asthma went away. Started taking vitamin D supplements. Quit taking vitamin D, quit eating healthy (frozen pizza and ice cream diet), and quit working out.

My asthma came back hardcore had to go to the doctor for the first time since I was 16 (20 when I went there). Go an inhaler and had to rely on it for about a year during that time I exercised some and ate a little better (nothing too major) didn't really do anything I was really confused.

Came across a studying mentioning children taking vitamin D for asthma and getting good results. 

https://nutritionfacts.org/video/vitamin-d-for-asthma/

Immediately got a year supply off Amazon for like $15. Immediately saw results my asthma attacks went from being really wheezy to not being wheezy or as strong. Still used inhaler for  a few months but not nearly as often. So $15 a year=less asthma attacks and the asthma isn't nearly as bad. Now I'm almost 22 and it's like I never had asthma. 

To be honest it pisses me off that noone has ever told me to supplement with vitamin D which btw is free if you go outside often enough [assuming you a lacking clothing and sunscreen] (I don't so I supplement).

My inhaler is $35 for a 25 day supply with good insurance still have to get a doctor's visit once a year for it (probably not any more since one inhaler will probably last me for a year now if ai even use it that is) without insurance it's $60-$70. Yearly doctor visit along with $35 every few months was avoided with something that costs $15 a year (it's really over a year supply 380 caps of 10,000IU can litterally take one every other day and get results so more like a 2 year supply).

Just my own experience if this is what preventive medicane was then I'd b down for it. 

Sadly preventive medicine is ""this is an inhaler, you will have asthma for the rest of your life, here is an allergy pill for people with asthma (pill did nothing quit taking it) now visit me every year to renew your perscription also don't exercise (they literally told me this)."" 

Instead of here is an inhaler you can try vitamin D and see if it helps along with a healthier diet and moderate amounts of exercise. 

Sadly making this a reality probably isn't going to happen any time soon unless we get over our greed (patented drugs and only researching them instead of more natural options (think ginger and apples). Along with potential lawsuits meaning the doctor has to lay everything on the table including risks preferably otherwise it's going to be this didn't work for me blah blah blah."
healthcare,"Interesting. I've heard basically the exact opposite about aviation. Their sensors are very well-designed with tiers of warnings, where emergencies are given high priorities and minor things are just a tiny amber light. This helps keep pilots aware of the large issues immediately. Also, aviation has very religious use of checklists that are very well-engineered to not be redundant or useless. Their checklists (and they have checklists for every situation) are developed, prototyped, refined, and implemented to catch common mistakes pilots tend to make. Healthcare technology is not like that at all, unfortunately.

One problem with checklists or fancier tools is that it gets incredibly complex trying to account for all of the complicated variables that could come up in operation. In aviation, examples would be flying in arctic weather for a prolonged period of time, which could cause fuel lines to start to freeze in ice chunks on the surface of the liquid or random ducks flying into your engines while you're over New York City. Computers don't really have the intuition for how to deal with these crises, and they happen too rarely to even predict, let alone develop training examples from.

One of the benefits of checklist-style procedures is that they don't just catch the dumb things, but by having the entire staff (be it the pilot and co-pilot OR the surgery team of surgeon, nurses, anesthesiologists, etc) go through the checklist together to discuss the case, goal, expectations, etc then there is an established teamwork and trust that greatly increases chances of survival when complications arise. Often times in surgery, the team doesn't even know one another's names, and if a nurse thinks a doctor needs to wash his hands because of dealing with something non-sterile, they might not speak up depending on the culture. Having that simple routine helps sync the teamwork so that they can react to a rare crisis better than a computer probably could.

You are right, though, that nurses and doctors are too stressed and technology needs to do a better job managing patients before crises arise."
healthcare,"Yes, and the counterpoint 

Capitalism is the greatest system on earth but it’s only effective/efficient when customers can hold venders accountable and they can only do that when there are choices. 

Your employer chooses your plan, your geography chooses your hospital, and your 911 system chooses your ambulance. So if this is how to run a free market, we need to privatize water pipes. Make running a bath as much fun as choosing a Comcast plan."
healthcare,"From best to worst:

1) Functional free market (choices)

2) functional government (democracy)

3) dysfunctional free market (monopoly)

4) dysfunctional government (communism)

US healthcare is #3, no individual choices, changing to #2 is an improvement because there isn’t enough customer power to make #1 possible (see next reply).

But your right, every change has winners and losers and the losers generally fight tooth and nail against. For the owners of the current system the answer is buying them out. Buy all the hospitals and other infrastructure the new system will need anyway. Buy the insurance companies so those shareholders aren’t rioting in the streets.

Then rehire most of the employees, many of whom will be in short supply because we’ll be treating so many new people who till then went without. Then find ways to shift redundant workers, whose only job is paperwork in the current system that would become obsolete. You don’t need billing clerks if everyone works for the same system."

healthcare,"ED is way different than outpatient first off. What procedure code was used?

Also, that isn't the issue with health care, and I doubt you will get any money in small claims court. "
healthcare,"It may exist elsewhere but its an idea (and language) of i've been working on for a few years.

These ideas come from my innate ability to see systems, combined with specific life experiences. I've spent my career severing customers in one form or another and the worst job in that chain was a non profit with several overlapping monopolies. I got in there and set about improving things for customers and encountered severe resistance at all levels. The culture was used to doing things on the organization's terms instead of on the customers terms and I couldn't figure out why until I pieced it all together (after I had left).

The good thing about the US is that we are self deterministic. This enables and inspires us to try lots of things and be good at many of them. The bad thing about the US is that we are self deterministic. This sets us up to believe good people can succeed even when the system is poor and blame them when they don't. So much so, we are often only willing to change a system when a bigger better mouse trap comes along. Changes at the ballot box tend to be smaller and slower and less popular (like healthcare).

BTW, the reason government (2) is less responsive than business (1) is the time scale. If you buy milk one week and it sucks, you shift to another milk vendor the very next week. If you buy a politician (vote) one year and it sucks, it will be 2-6 years before you can shift to another vendor. But monopolies (3) can be intrenched for decades before technology or some other force finally sweeps them aside. And dictatorships (4) are fractions of a century before they can be changed (North Korea)."
healthcare,"Figured it's either something you put together, or some idea I should have been aware of.

Still making the distinction is very important I'll be sure to remember this.

We hear about the free market, and just automatically assume it's a good thing. The only problem with that is just like with everything else there is a good free market (choices), and a bad ""free market"" (monopolies)."
healthcare,[removed]
healthcare,"Yes, parts of the economy are obviously public (roads) and vs obviously private (cars) while other public / private examples are closer together or even overlapping like schools. And our society is divided about where the line should be.

And this gets into cause and effect and the privatization paradox. We look at how well cars are designed and assume the good results are because they are made by private companies. But the virtue of capitalism isn’t privateness, it’s competition, without which private is worse (3) than government (2). 

So when something without competition like prison gets converted public &gt; private, it’s hoped the change produces 2 -&gt; 1 but in practice actually produces 2 -&gt; 3. And most realized cost savings are more the result of a private operators willingness to cut corners than any new operational efficiency. 

And things like prisons, schools, and hospitals have their own paradox: they need economies of scale to be more efficient and for that they need larger buildings. But by the time the building has enough rooms to be more efficient, there aren’t enough buildings for customers to have two good ones to choose from."
healthcare,"Without knowing much about your situation, I'd say that ""suing"" the hospital is likely not an option (or even something you'd want to do if it were). Maybe look to see if your state has any balance billing laws and/or contact your insurance company. 

I know this is easy to say in hindsight and as a third party observer, but in the future if you think something can be done in the outpatient setting, don't waste your time and money in the ED, especially during flu season! "

healthcare,"I hope you get some closure on this. I too have been on the receiving end of this preposterous routine at the Hospital ER. I was billed $700 for a plastic support band, that sell on Amazon for $25. I don't get this system, that is build on sucking the blood out of any one with Insurance.  I have heard cases where people refuse to pay and the hospital willingly (not surprisingly) reduces the bill. 
"
healthcare,"While $900 is a lot of money, it is not a big bill from an ED. I used to work for billing in a hospital. $4000 is a closer number for surgeries and stuff. I doubt you would win any court case about $900. Snall claims court couldn't hurt to try though.

You should try an urgent care in the future. Sorry about the bill though. Medical debt is pure bullshit. "
healthcare,"You are correct, lack of transparency is a problem but it’s an effect not a cause. 

If you had 50 hospitals near you, each owned by different companies and time to research them before visiting any, they would be fighting for your business and jumping through hoops to stand out from the crowd, including posting prices.

That’s how it is with gasoline and other goods and services. But hospitals are are much lower volume. By the time a building has enough beds to have economies of scale (to be efficient), there are so few buildings that each hospital dominates its area. You have no choice but to go there (when a hospital is needed), so they have no incentive to make ‘shopping there’ easy."

healthcare,Could you link to a few of the articles that are raising doubts? The few I've read make it sound like it's currently too preliminary to know what the outcome of an endeavor like this would be.
healthcare,"Sorry, I should clarify that it's unlikely in the short term. The reasons boil down to essentially:

1. it's takes a while to get manufacturing running with the necessary regulatory clearance

2. It's going to be very difficult for these systems to predict generic shortages, though in my opinion given the size of the systems and if Ascension's merger with Providence happens it could make predictions easier. The main thing here for them to be effective at this they'd need more information on demand than the consolidated generic manufacturers they're competing with.

3. Vertical integrations are going to be costly and their manufacturing contracts and possibly facilities aren't likely to outperform those of companies that have specialized in generic production for years already.

These articles touches on these.

healthcare,"Well your comment is simply not true.

We teach all our physicians to be “insurance blind,” which means they treat the patient and the problem in a medically necessary manner no matter the insurance, or lack there of.

We ask for your information so that we can avoid fraud, avoid unnecessary bills to patients, and to ensure that the insurance payer pays for your care.

Hospitals give millions of dollars of free care and write offs for patients that can not pay for their care. If you think there was no clinical reason for something your provider ordered, than ask for the reasoning and feel free to question the need, but don’t assume they are ordering unnecessary tests unless you ask some questions first."

healthcare,[removed]
healthcare,"I looked at your profile and I see that you are not from the U.S., so my comment is with that in mind.


There is no straightforward answer to your question. First, when you ask, ""how much would it cost"", the cost to who? To the family?
 If so, then, do they have health insurance through the father's job (possible for a working class factory worker, if he's full-time and has okay benefits)? If so, what does the insurance plan look like? What are the co-pays and deductibles? OR, if the family's income is low enough, is the mother covered by Medicaid because she pregnant? (Medicaid eligibility also differs by state.) Depending on what kind of insurance they have, and how good the plan is, how much the family pays out of pocket could vary substantially. 

Okay, so family aside... how much does the birth just ""cost""? That is, regardless of how much the *family* pays out of pocket, what does the final bill look like? How much would their insurance (if they had it) pay? Again, there is no clear answer. Healthcare pricing is notoriously opaque in the U.S. and highly variable. Each healthcare provider sets their own rates. They also negotiate their rates with private insurance companies, with the government (which provides insurance to some portions of the population), and even with individual patients. 


This article, while it does not address premature births specifically, gives you an idea of just how variable the question of ""cost"" in U.S. healthcare can be: http://time.com/money/4995922/how-much-costs-give-birth-state/ 

There probably is an ""average"" cost out there somewhere for the scenario you provided. But it's not easy to come by. "

healthcare,"Unsubstantiated claim. So easy to blame Trump huh? People themselves have no responsibility or accountability, right? "
healthcare,"Didn't used to be this hard.  Pre-ACA if you needed a private plan, you found an insurance agent who would do all the work &amp; find the best company/policy/cost - and they'd do it for free (they get paid by commission from the health insurance companies).

healthcare,"I looked at your survey, and I saw that $0 was never an option. I feel like it’s a pretty big assumption to always assume people will pay more for a DNP vs someone with only a masters. Similarly, 0 minutes should have been a choice to get the full picture of how the field is perceived.  "
healthcare,"Congratulations! This is a great problem to have. I got an MHA but went in to consulting rather than the fellowship route so I can't say much about how fellowships will perceive the different schools. 

That said, what I've noticed working with a range of people across the industry is that people that have MHAs or that work closely with hospital administration give disproportionate respect to Minnesota. In other words the perceived prestige gap is greater than the actual quality gap. But as you get further away from hospital administration that prestige drops off sharply. Minnesota may as well be Iowa. So if you wanted to switch out of hospital administration Johns Hopkins or Columbia might have a stronger reputation just because they're more universally known and respected.

You probably are over emphasizing school reputation. It could matter a lot for your fellowship but after that, most people in the industry aren't looking at university rankings every year, so where you went to school gets less and less important the further you get from graduation. I'd encourage you to think more about what educational experience will be best for you. Building your skills is more important than building your resume.

healthcare,"Congrats, those are all very strong programs! Are you interested in a dual MBA/ MHA? That is worth considering as I know that UNC offers one. 
If I remember correctly, Michigan is currently ranked #1 in the country but as the other commenter stated, rankings are only part of the equation. What you really want to know from these places is the strength of their alumni base and how much they vouch for their own. 

If you are from the west close, all these are far away, so don’t let the location be the determining factor. I will say that UNC will be warmer than the others...

Staff are not feeling safe at work and don’t feel supported by administration.  

What do your facilities do in this situation? "
healthcare,"I think most of the excessive costs we pay compared to other countries would be corrected with a single payer system since it saves a lot of money currently wasted on administrative costs and allows for setting reasonable prices for drugs and services.

Single payer also has the benefit of including everyone in a huge pool to cover the costs when people need care.  Hospitals would then get paid for all services.  More people will be able to work and be more productive when they get the care they need.  Set it up as a progressive tax that is separate from regular income tax like social security.  Right now lots of jobs don't offer health insurance, but in single payer all those employees would be contributing something to the fund.  Jobs with health insurance benefits are decreasing, part-time, contract, etc and there's no guarantee a job with the benefit now will keep it or how the plan will change next year.  Single payer would give people the freedom to change jobs w/o the fear of losing ""good"" insurance, more people would take the risk to start a business, retire early, work part-time, freelance or whatever to increase work/life balance that is so lacking in our society.  Companies know people live in fear of losing health insurance from a job and that keeps many under their control.

I also see a lot less stress no longer worrying if a clinic or hospital is in network or not, especially when away from home, changing insurance plans and networks at the choice of your employer, out of pocket costs that bankrupt people everyday, denied claims, deductible resetting each year, etc.  The current system is such a mess and people think it's normal which is crazy.  No country wants to copy our system because it sucks and their citizens would revolt yet too many here keep electing people who insist on maintaining it and I just can't understand why.

I agree with encouraging exercise and nutrition which could be part of the single payer healthcare system.  There's a lot to that issue though with food deserts and I don't even know what all.  I don't support trying to monitor people's diet/life choices since that creates additional administrative costs and invades our privacy/big brother.  Interestingly there are studies that show lifetime healthcare costs are actually lower for smokers and obese people since they die sooner.  Micromanaging people to qualify for healthcare would cost way more than it would save.

healthcare,That sounds high to me.  Go get a second opinion.
healthcare,"The problem is, it's difficult to tell you whether that's the case or not.   The x-rays are fairly standard for new patients, that way they have a documentation of what your teeth were like. 

When you go to get your bottom row cleaned, do not be afraid to be your own advocate.  Let your dentist know that you are new to this and would like to better understand what is necessary and why.  Ask him things like, ""Are three root canals truly necessary?""  ""Is there another route?""  ""$8k is fairly steep for me, is there a way to stage these operations to make it more manageable for me?""  ""What would you recommend I do with my own dental care at home to avoid things getting worse?""  

These kinds of questions make patients nervous, because they are afraid of imposing or angering their doctor, but approach them as someone eager to learn and seeking their knowledge to make better, more informed care.  

One of the biggest problems in healthcare is that there is not a lot of price transparency between providers and you will potentially spend more than necessary to find out there is no better price elsewhere.  And different dentists approach the same problem differently and may recommend different treatments. 

Keep seeking knowledge and become as informed as possible.  That is your best move going forward."
healthcare,"Root canal runs about $1000 for molars.   
You won't want to do all this work in one go - spread it out over time. Your dental insurance is per year, work out some of it over a couple of years.   
 Start with the most critical/painful/ugly...   
Congrats on the job, sorry about your teeth. Unfortunately they are pretty important to quality of long life.      
(Sad that your situation kept you away from personal care...but you're making up for neglect.)"
healthcare,"It depends.  It's pretty much a case manager that deals specifically with behavioral health patients, homeless patients, etc.  These patients typically require more/different things than a ""standard"" patient being discharged."
healthcare,"ask medical records about correcting the record. i dont know the exact process but I believe it is part of ""the patient's rights."" there is a policy for this at mu facility."

healthcare,"Let's make one thing absolutely clear here.  You are not a doctor.  You are looking a medical record, and are upset/offended by something so you want it changed.  But your doctor IS A DOCTOR.  He/she has gone through a lot of training and is using medical terminology they use to convey important medical information.  When the doctor writes that you are *""alert, cooperative, appears well nourished, in no acute distress""* do you understand what the provider is actually saying?  They aren't saying you've got a big old smile on your face, they're saying that you **are able to sit up by yourself, you aren't doubled over in pain moaning incoherently, and you don't appear emaciated**.  

These are OBJECTIVE findings made by the examiner, for you to think it should be changed out of some ill-conceived notion that this will somehow affect your benefits is woefully misguided to say the least.  If you want a different doctor, feel free.  But fair warning, I look at medical records every day, and they all use this sort of terminology, it's part of basic medical training.  

To be honest your comments and some of the other comments in this thread ""looks like a case of malpractice"" and ""ask medical records to correct the record"" are absurd, it shows a total lack of understanding of how the medical profession operates, and how healthcare records are maintained.  "

healthcare,Wow! Glad you are well!
healthcare,"Thank You so, so much. I live near the top of a mountain in an area w maybe a few hundred people. Am from USA and grew up w my asthma and allergies giving me far too many trips to the ER/hospital stays and thankfully had great insurance through my family. Have not had an asthma attack, nor insurance for that matter, for maybe ten years after making changes (most important being less stress) and have no idea why last night went down how it did. Do not know what triggered the attack.

Bundled up and slowly left the house around 5:30am looking for someone to Help me after hours of struggling and trying home remedies that did not work. After walking the 25 stairs up to the dirt road from the house plus the freezing air hitting me I thought I was a goner. Practiced purse breathing and just kept moving. I just kept squeeking out ""hos-pi-tahl"" hoping someone would hear me. Neighbor's brilliant daughter helped me find a ride and that ride took me 40 minutes into the nearest big city. When the hospital staff told me to get in a wheelchair I fought it, then they demanded it and things got easier from there-so hard to even move or hold oneself up after hours of struggling to breathe. When they gave me oxygen w medicine in it I pretty much fell asleep. My bronchial tubes opened up and I could relax my exhausted chest muscles.

Could not believe there was no fee/charge. If I ever strike it rich that emergency room is getting a hefty donation. Can still pay rent now, which is so good. And picked up an inhaler just to be safe. Feels better knowing I have that even though I haven't had one for years. Have been sleeping most of the day. Body is sore. ;)

Thank You to All nurses, doctors and hospital workers. To bring someone relief in a scary situation is truly amazing. It is Everything. I Love You All. ❤

tldr: felt like I was going to die. found good people who helped me. am grateful for modern medicine and the important people who administer it.

I suggest looking into Bernie Sanders’ discussion events with healthcare professionals in the U.S. and around the world on YouTube. We can either have the same overly complex, bureaucratic multi-payer system we have now and spend time away from recovering from illness to fight with private, for-profit companies or on the phone with a billing rep on covering my $50 per month medication, or finally expand Medicare for everyone and pay just a bit more in taxes for it — yes, taxes. That thing citizens must pay to get services back from the government, which is usually vastly cheaper that giving it to private companies in the form of premiums, deductibles, co-pays, and co-insurance (or denials!)."

It sounds to me, given the length of time you’ve been dealing with it, like you will need a quick surgical fix. Don’t worry though, it is an *extremely* common problem and recovery is a breeze. There are doctors who put food on the table solely by fixing these things."

The free preventative visit is for when you're not sick and the doctor is giving you a check up. After that you'll pay 25 dollars, then afterwards is when you'll pay whatever the doctor charges x 80%. 

Typically you need to find a doctor in your insurance network or it wont count towards your deductible, out of pocket cost, or be covered by the insurance. You can shop online and make appointments via zocdoc or just call the office directly. "

healthcare,"I just turned 26, and I went with the cheapest plan that they offered. Insurance is expensive, and I'd rather not spend any more than I have to.

But it really depends on your individual healthcare needs. For example, if you have a preexisting condition that requires you to visit the doctor quite often or to purchase prescription medication, you may want to invest in a plan that has low or no deductible, low copays, and low prescription costs. If you tend to participate in riskier than usual activities, such as snow boarding, biking, motorcycling, extreme hiking, skiing, racing, and etc., I would recommend getting something that covers emergency services very well. Otherwise, if you're an average healthy individual and you don't expect to see the doctor often, you can get by with the cheapest one that they have, but make sure that it includes preventative care. Most plans will cover preventative care 100%.

Some insurance companies don’t include co-pays in the deductible, but do include them in the out-of-pocket max to pass on a bit of expenses to the patient. This would buy them some time to save costs until the timer runs out and resets the annual deductible.

healthcare,"Depends on your plan. If you meet your deductible you only have to worry about copays and coinsurance. Some plans charge different coinsurance and copays for different fees. For example you will get hit with a bill from the actual doctor and the hospital. Your insurance may pay 80% but only after you pay a copay, usually no more than $150. But generally once you pay your 20% until you reach your out of pocket you'll be covered 100% after."

healthcare,"Oftentimes it’s social work type activities, like calling authorities to help. This might be a situation of a suicidal patient that has an event and the case worker would contact social work, police, etc. to help the individual. There is a connection to the hospital because most of these patients show up in the emergency department (ED) after an event in their lives.

This isn’t limited to mental health patients. This could apply to patients or families in abusive relationships or situations as well. Case workers would be called when, for example, a mom and her children show up to the ED with obvious signs of abuse.

healthcare,"I can think of 3 scenarios off the top of my head:

1. They billed it incorrectly, which resulted in your insurance not covering it.  After you got the notice from your insurance, the doctor submitted a corrected claim which was paid.  You owe nothing in this scenario.

2. They billed it, discovered it was not covered, and their policy is to write it off.  You owe nothing in this scenario.

3. They billed it, it was denied, they don't understand why so they appealed, the appeal was denied, they don't understand why so they resubmitted the claim 2 or 3 more times, waiting 90 says each time, and are just now realizing that this won't be covered.  They might decide to bill you in this case.

Honestly each scenario is equally likely so the odds are you don't have to pay anything, if you want you can call to ask them.  "
healthcare,"I usually -and I know this is a bit weird -make an agenda for the visit. I acknowledge that the provider is going to have a lot of things they have to do as part of a new patient visit and I politely assert (because it's my health after all) that I'd like to make sure we include time to talk about what's on my list. 

The GP's plan will involve taking a history of past and present illness including current medications. If she has any previous records from past GPs or specialists, that can be a big help; doubly so if you can get them to the GP's office and alert someone there to their existence ahead of time. For meds (I have a few different vitamins and supplements I take, and this works well for them), I like to line them all up and take a cell phone photo to have with me. 

I also ask if I can record the audio of the visit. I've never had someone say no and I save the audio in an Evernote notebook along with a scan or digital copy of every record, bill, etc. 

I think there's nothing wrong -although it's not usually the norm -in flipping the power dynamic. After all, it's your wife's health and body and she's the customer. I'd do it politely, of course. And we're seeing, increasingly, physicians are starting to not only appreciate, but expect a higher degree of engaged patients. 

If someone were to push back, I think I'd consider that a data point in and of itself that they might not be the right doctor for me. For instance, I had one physician tell me not to read medical journals. That was a huge turn off - I pulled out the 'I work in healthcare at [prestigious institution]' line ...but wished I didn't have to. 

That said, being prepared, in addition to an agenda, with any articles (from journals or even blogs) that may be interesting to your wife could be helpful. 

There have also been times when a provider has told me that they simply don't have enough time for everything on my agenda. In that instance, they offered to help make a follow up appointment the following day (something that is more of a trademark of that particular practice than the norm). So don't be too surprised if the GP asks her to prioritize her concerns &amp; questions. 
"
healthcare,"It's not 100% universal, but it's quite common. It's called 'provider based billing' and happens for one of two reasons: Often, it's because the ER physicians don't actually work for the hospital. They are a separate 'practice' and bill for their time separately. In the times when the ER physicians do work for the hospital, the hospital also bills for their time separately because....well...they can. 

One thing to watch out for - both parties will send their claims in on their own schedule. Increasingly, that's an electronic transaction and both happen on the same day. But usually neither party is aware of where the other part is in the billing cycle. So if your deductible is, say, $500 and the hospital bills you $400 and the providers bill $400, then both might expect you to pay them $400 because they assume you are below your deductible...but in fact, at $900 you'd be above the deductible. I picked smaller than average numbers, but hopefully the point is clear. The trick is to determined who got their bill in first. The one who got their bill to your insurance second has to take the write off.

healthcare,"The providers may be different, but they may also not be, the doctors you're seeing now could very well accept both Kaiser plans....the HMO's, PPO's, and the Medi-Cal plans. You should ask your providers if they accept it, that way you'll know going in. 

The care you get will be the same, providers do not treat Medi-Cal patients differently, but you may not be able to see the same providers and any medications you're on may not be covered, you'll want to check all that before making the move. 

You would not be able to switch back to paying mid year unless you have a life changing event, and you would only lose Kaiser if you change to Medi-Cal if you don't choose Kaiser as the Medi-Cal plan you want, or if their enrollment is closed. "
healthcare,"THIS is why one of my healthcare provider frequently sues the major insurance companies through small claims courts and we haven't lost (we've always settled) one yet.

healthcare,"Get paid for their name while they continue working in their own practice or something else. "
healthcare,"If you owe a specific doctor money, and that's the doctor that he wants to go to, then yes, they could refuse to see him until he pays what he owes. 

Any other physician, who has no ties to his past balances, will not refuse to see him as they don't know that he owes money, they don't run credit checks. 

Hospitals cannot refuse to treat him if he needs to be seen and owes them money. 

You can go to any doctor or urgent care facility and pay cash, no problem, but they probably won't see him if he doesn't pay up front. A hospital will see him even if he can't pay up front, but only to stabilize him, prolonged care may be refused without payment. "
healthcare,"Agreed with /u/KILLSBITCHES but also, unless you know your friends benefits, you have no idea what his OOP maximum actually is. I've seen them as low as $1,000 and as high as $250,000, it varies greatly. "
healthcare,"Yes, I was dropped from a plan for missing a payment and the only way I was able to get back on was because I had a life changing event (I moved) and thus, was able to get back on but was without insurance for a full month. I missed the payment by one day. (It was an ACA plan)

If they are not giving him the option to pay the arrears to get back on the plan, then he's out of luck until open enrollment which is in December, unless he comes up with a life changing qualifying event. "

Also, reloading takes less than 2 seconds, so it really doesn't matter what the capacity of the magazine is. If the gun has a 10-round magazine, then you could just carry four extras and still have the same overall capacity"

healthcare,"I'm thinking of insurance billing fraud specifically.  It's several systems but includes claims processing and medical bill processing.  We found that providers were represented multiple times in the database (sometimes hundreds of times), so my team implemented a set of grouping algorithms and I want to expose any patterns that might exist in the grouped records that couldn't be seen in when the providers were treated separately, if that makes sense?"
healthcare,"Sort of, what kind of patterns are you looking for? Sequential? Correlation? Other ?"
healthcare,"I would love to know more! I’m definitely interested in getting six sigma certified. My current role doesn’t require it and won’t pay for it...I think it’s really smart for these companies to invest in nurses! "
healthcare,"You pay 100% of your deductible and I believe 20% up to $4000 following.  However I believe you plan is capped $1500 for an in-network par provider.  However, any response is speculative and the only way to get a certain and precise answer is to call the number on the back of your insurance card"
healthcare,"Echoing what was said by JR1202 that without additional information or someone to explain your benefits to you, we're pretty much guessing here.

Is this a plan offered through work? HR may be able to explain this to you.

Otherwise, what's happening here might be a ""per episode of care"" sort of deal where you reach a $1500 maximum per episode of care and a $4000 per year under your insurance. 

Insurance is difficult to navigate and they don't make it easy. Hang in there. "
healthcare,Will do! thank you very much!
healthcare,"Insurance is complicated with many moving parts and many different member products.  Often a carrier creates a specific product for a specific se t if clients or employers.  These customizations created to work best for each client results in many different scenarios.  This makes it required to for you as a member to contact your insurance plan on the back of your insurance card.

I assure you that what is complicated with figuring out specifics of a member's plan is a simple results and unavoidable byproduct of these customizations.  

This is why I suggest to contact the actual insurance plan, not HR.  HR c sn help you with things like forms or understanding enrollment dates.  They aren't experts regarding the details of the plan, but the insurance plan customer service representatives are experts."

Although thinking about it, ask to get the full STD panel as well, including HIV and also Hepatitis A/B/C. "
healthcare,"My objective is to show value in the grouping, so probably correlation between say length of treatment or amount/types of downcodes when looking at an individual record vs the grouped records? If a provider bills under multiple TIN/NPIs, could there be correlation between how they bill and which ID they're using for billing?  If there was, what indicators would there be?"
healthcare,"correlation is not causation.  I don't know that this can be shown to be significantly significant.  This article really cherry-picks facts to fit the thesis of the article.

&gt; ""Siegel's analysis only found a correlation, and is not a causal explanation."" (Petulla)   

I also wonder if the number of mass shootings tracked over 4 years is a long enough time span to really evaluate a measurable reduction.   

One thing, too, is that ""high-capacity"" magazines are still obtainable in states with bans.  For example, when the ban in Colorado was enacted, everyone that already owned these magazines were allowed to legally keep them.  The ban only prohibited new sales.  The problem with that is you can still purchase disassembled magazines as a ""parts/repair kit"" that can be assembled into a working magazine immediately after purchase."
healthcare,"Could there be a correlation of when the billing is entered  into the system and what TIN/NPI used? "
healthcare,"Actually that's a good idea, we could look into correlation between timing and TIN/NPI as well as maybe the zipcode and the TIN/NPI to see if maybe different specialties are being used to get increased payments by geo area.  Thanks!"
healthcare,"You’re welcome. "
healthcare,"Your hospital has a very arduous job.  They have to create bill that goes to an insurance company and the insurance company will then try to low-ball them as much as possible to keep themselves solvent while also paying the hospital for the care that you pay them for.  And you are one of many people who sought their services that day - they have an entire community of people to care for.

The hospital also has the added difficulty of absorbing the bad debt from illegal immigrants, the homeless, and the uninsured.  These people have little-to-no ability to pay for their medical care (and paradoxically are also more likely to use medical services) and are unlikely to pay at all.  Hospitals have to write this debt off and pass it along to those that can pay.  So they have a chargemaster of prices for various goods and services in their hospital, they're more expensive than would make sense, but between this bad debt, the price that it actually is, the fact that medicine is costly and has to be wielded by professionals, and the need to achieve some level of profit means that these prices will seem bloated, but it's because it is being viewed out of context.

It's very easy to be angry about a problem, but take this anger and frustration that you have and use it to help find a solution.  Otherwise you'll achieve nothing and lose all of your time and energy on being angry."
healthcare,You're right - insurance companies will not reimburse hospitals for tests and services that are irrelevant or of minimal medical benefit.  Insurance companies are beginning to monitor more than just ICD-10 codes/physician codes and regularly hold hospitals accountable for reckless spending.

A similar post-2009 (i.e. The ACA) audiobook would be Reinventing American Health Care by Ezekiel Emanuel.

Without the ACA you may or may not have an outlet."
healthcare,"If a physician or hospital doesn't have an established arrangement with the entity claiming to provide you coverage, you got nothing.  There are many organizations out there who attempt to negotiate a discount on the back end of an encounter but in truth they have zero leverage.

If on the other hand this is a communal arrangement where premiums are placed in a pool and the pool is reduced when a claim is paid two things come to mind. 1) see the paragrph above in terms of zero pricing leverage and 2) plans like this tend to attract patient with high health care needs and so the water in the pool gets sucked out faster than it comes in.

I spoke to someone who is in the business some months ago and asked how large a pool of participants do you need to smooth out the spikes in expense - his answer was at least 25,000 premium paying people.

In healthcare things that sound good and affordable are typically crap.  By the way hospitals are mostly non-profit.  How is that working for everyone?"

healthcare,"That might normally seem like an outlandish statement, but considering the lengths I’m going to to understand this industry, I completely agree that it must be as complicated as it is for no other reason but to ward off people from wrapping their heads around it. Just yesterday I read a Wall Street Journal article calling it the most complicated industry out there.."
healthcare,"our health care system is more complicated than our tax code. the tax code is better documented and at least sourced in a single place. "
healthcare,"I have a Health sharing medical plan.  Its religious based and do wish these programs could be expanded to non-religious use but for the time being under the law, they work pretty well as far as I have seen.  The difference is this is NOT insurance.  Its really a cash pool to pay for care.  For normal stuff it handles these cost very well.  For example: I had a standardized set of medical blood tests run for about 11-12 different tests.  The insurance cost for this test is $3,250.  But LabCorp has a cash version of the same test for $285. I paid cash for the test and the health share reimbursed my expenses.  I should note that my deductible is $500, which i had already exceeded so the cost for the medical test was $0.  I have a major knee surgery coming up. So since this is really a cash situation, I shopped around for the service and can get a much lower price for the procedure at a private facility.  It's about $18,000 with recovery and some physical therapy.  So we will see what the cost comes out to.  But considering the historical average on the sharing has been 98-99% of the costs covered, I am looking at maybe $100-$300 out of pocket.  Hell, if it was $2,000 out of pocket, that is still much better than any other insurance. "
healthcare,Zero Transparency. Zero Cost Control imposed. Insurance denies payouts while increasing premiums year over year. Its a multi facetted problem.  I think the key is the price transparency.  And you cant choose which hospital you end up at in an emegency situation. So I'll add lack of choice. And lack of effective oversight in relation to all of the above.
healthcare,"As a result of increased employee costs that discourage employees from working in the urban setting at the rural wage. Decreasing employee supply as a result. Driving the wage higher because of reduced supply.  
  
But not because of the costs directly.  
  
Hence why I said ""the supply of surgeons may very well be low"". Supply may be low because of education costs. But prices are not high because of education costs. They are high because of low supply.  
  
It's important to properly attribute each cause and effect. Otherwise we are short cutting the full explanation, and may attempt to implement policy that affects the wrong thing."
healthcare,"Business 101 and economics 101 - the cost to any supplier in any market has no bearing on the equilibrum price at which a transaction between a seller and buyer occurs. Easy example? Text messages. There was a long time where they were priced at $0.10/message, yet only cost the supplier something like $0.00001 to send. That's thousands of percents profit margins. This wasn't some fluke for a day / week / month. This went on for years.  
  
Imagine you bought a table from Ikea 1 year ago. Brand new still in the box, never used. Cost you $300. Ikea has since put it on sale for $200 now. You want to sell it, and list it on Craigslist. Does anyone on Craigslist care that you paid $300? Do you demand that someone pay you $300 because that was what it cost you? No one cares. The max anyone is willing to pay now will be $200 (or perhaps a bit less with no return policy from you), since they can get it from Ikea for $200 anyways.  
  
The cost of ANY supplier in ANY market has no bearing on the price a buyer is willing to pay in that market."
healthcare,"Generally, the price to file in small claims is pretty small, around $50. The point isn't to come ahead financially (the odds of winning are likely low). The point is to attempt to take a stand, potentially win on principle, perhaps under the umbrella of some kind of price gouging law or whatever else is available.  
  
&gt; If they can't make a profit, they can't operate.  
  
Don't know about where you are, but around me, miniature ""emergency rooms"" on intersection corners are popping up like weeds. This is yet another indication that profits are bloated in the market, and new suppliers are rushing in to open up shop and collect those profits.  
  
&gt; Can you propose a system that does cost allocation to ALL the departments a hospital has to pay with your desired 40 dollar payment? Show the numbers.  
  
The hospital's accounting problems are not my problem. I don't check the books to verify McDonalds is making a profit when I buy a burger. I just buy if it's a price that I am willing to pay. If it's too high, I go to one of a hundred other competitors for burgers. If McDonalds is not making a profit, they eventually close and leave the market. This reduces my options of suppliers of burgers, and the remaining suppliers might be capable of raising prices. Eventually only 1 burger supplier exists, and raises prices as high as they want.  
  
I had to repeat the coded procedure again the following day or two later. And it was then that I realized the coded procedure could be had for $40 on the open market.  
  
I actually had insurance as well, and paid substantially less out of pocket. But this wasn't a case of ""fake"" billed at $900, and ""real"" reduce billed at $200 to my insurance. My insurance actually paid the hospital $900. And on principle alone, I take issue with that. And want to fight the hospital on that charge however possible. Because it is this scenario exactly that is messing up health care for the rest of the country."

healthcare,"Why does ""yesterday"" make it a bad idea?  The age of an idea is a terrible way for rating it's effectiveness."
healthcare,"It was a procedure. It had a specific code. I matched that code from the ER with the code from the outpatient setting. They were exactly the same. So it was the same ""coded procedure""."
healthcare,"&gt; I think when you say emergency rooms are popping up on the corner, you are referring to URGENT CARE. That's what you should have used rather than go to a hospital.  
  
Nope, ER coverage often includes a substantially lower copayment than an out of network urgent care. I would have paid substantially more if I had gone to urgent care, since no in network urgent cares were open at the time.  
  
Also, of these new locations opening, some are urgent care, some are legit ERs. The urgent cares tend to me smaller buildings. The ERs tend to be larger buildings with a few beds. But they are not full blown hospitals. They are often marketed as ""community hospitals"". Probably capable of handling level 3 / 2 trauma. But level 1, they'll likely stabilize a tad and immediately ship you off to the real hospital.  
  
&gt; I believe you're having a difficult time understanding that the revenue from a physician at a Primary Care practice CANNOT be the same as at a hospital.  
  
&gt; The only source of revenue for healthcare is physician fees for service. If a hospital only charged that they would go bankrupt. There are hundreds of departments in a hospital that are not direct healthcare. All of those people need to be paid. The janitor, cook, nurse, security, IT, scheduling, billing.....the list goes on and on. This necessitates a large fee for service. Otherwise the hospital will go bankrupt and the community will not have needed access to care.  
  
This is the same cost argument. Costs do not determine prices. They determine whether suppliers enter or exit a market. New urgent care and emergency rooms are entering the market. Indicating that costs are low relative to prices, and profits are to be had. I'd start with this for an introduction to equilibrium price based revenue maximization:  
  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand#Equilibrium

&gt; Prices are all highly regulated. They can't just pick any price they want.  
  
Yet one provider charges $40 for a code, and another provider charges $900 for the same code ...  
  
&gt; Again....healthcare does not operate on the free market principles. There is no consumer choice that will eliminate competition. Who in their right mind will decide to not have cancer taken out of their body because it costs too much?  
  
&gt; You say you don't want to get involved with the hospitals budget, but for you to understand, that is exactly where you need to look.  
  
No consumer choice - yes, that is the problem. We need to fix that with price transparency. Require all hospitals to publish prices for every code conspicuously. So people can make choices based upon price. Hospital A cancer treatment $50k? Hospital B cancer treament $20k? Sure, I'll pick hospital B. Competition drives down prices. Hospital budgets - just repeat the McDonalds example. I'm not sure how to make that any more clear. It's plain and simple economics 101 and business 101.  
  
&gt; Insurance is why everything costs so much in healthcare. If you really want to fight back. Start paying out of pocket.  
  
Um, have you really not read any of the thousands of nightmare stories posted about people trying to pay cash for medical care? There are a few random places where cash has worked, but they are the significant minority.  
  
Just curious - why do you try to defend the hospitals so severely? Do you deny that they are swimming in cash? I know the ones near me are making boat loads of money."
healthcare,"Not sure why you keep replying so many different times to this thread ... you've already started a couple other discussion threads here.  
  
People make priced-based medical decisions all of the time. And it drives the availability in the market. Week to week, on-average you buy eggs from the cheapest grocery store around you. Occasionally, you need eggs immediately, and don't think about price at all. Your on-average decisions drive the availability of certain stores at certain price points. So that when you need eggs immediately, and cost is of no concern, you still only wind up paying at most 2x or 3x your normal egg price. This is how market ecosystems work."

If all these providers would stop trying to *hoard patient data*, and work on *sharing* data I think we could see some real improvements. I would like to see a centralized database that all medical providers could access. Then we wouldn't *need* to send information between providers at all because they could all access the same data.

But the providers are too concerned with trying to keep patients in their own system, so they intentionally make it difficult to share data, and therefore difficult to switch to a different provider.

healthcare,"Interoperability is definitely an ongoing conversation in the informatics community. The huge sticking point is always security. There are very strict laws protecting patient's health information, and very big fines for failing to do so. 

In order for you to access your personal information, you have to create a password protected account on your physician's website and log in. The more people who have access to your information on that account, the less secure it is. If everyone who works in healthcare in the entire country can log in and look at your information, how secure do you feel your privacy is being kept?"
healthcare,"&gt; If everyone who works in healthcare in the entire country can log in and look at your information, how secure do you feel your privacy is being kept?

Just because all of the information is stored in a central database, doesn't necessarily mean *all* of the providers have access to *all* of the data.

The way I imagine it, patient information would all be stored in a central place, and *your* physicians, or the people you *give consent* to are the ones who can pull *your* data. Not everyone.

This way, when you want to see a new dr, or need to give someone medical records for something, the records don't need to be moved around. You just grant access to those who need it."
healthcare,"So what you want is one universal medical record that everyone can type in? And who gets to create/ maintain this medical record on their server? Right now, there are multiple medical record options and the hospital can pick the product that works for them at a cost they can afford. For everyone to be able to access information, there would have to be one single record option on a single database. Imagine having every person's medical information stored in one location. Other than it being a logistical nightmare, you also end up right back at our starting point of a security nightmare if that database got hacked.

healthcare,"If they receive data from providers they are under exactly the same laws as any other covered entity business associate. If they receive it from patients then yes, they are not subject to HIPAA, as patients are free to tell whoever they want anything about themselves, including their medical history."
healthcare,"There are limited databases that share information already across a vast network. The pharmacy system for narcotics is a great example. Pharmacists are able to cross reference prescriptions at various locations to limit doctor shopping or early refills.

The main problem with HIEs is standardizing the way information is input into the database so it all means the same thing as it's accessed by different records systems. Health records are so varied, and not all information is pulled from the same sections or sources. A few solutions have been suggested, like having records on thumb drives that the patient carries, so wherever they go, the physician can plug in that drive and access/input information. But that's heavily dependent on patients remembering to carry it with them, and having backups. Mobile apps are also working on a similar solution. 

Informatics is a fun field to be in at the moment!"
healthcare,"Google doesn't have any interest in the medical records arena. They briefly played around with Google Health, but shut it down quickly and got out of the business.

healthcare,"That’s definitely true, but email is generally organized in the wrong way for this healthcare application. Most healthcare use cases that are using faxing now are trying to communicate documents from one entity or location to another, not from one person to another.

The US currently pays 70% higher fees for Private and 30% higher fees public healthcare compared to Canada and the UK. Currently Medicaid and Medicare make up about 50% of the market. Not everyone would be content with Medicaid and Medicare, so some would still pay for Insurance. Even if Medicaid and Medicare took over 100% of the US market, we would still pay 30% more then the next highest paying country. This is a simple and elegant cost control for healthcare "

healthcare,"There are few ready-made web-based applications like Elysium Exchange and much more by which the physicians do manage patients information like past medical reports, allergies, etc. Users can also send the details to any reference doctors. This can be done with HIPAA compliance in mind to ensure there is confidentiality in the patient's data. Doctors can then forward the information in their own EMRs. Thus, there will be an easy export functionality which will be in the encrypted format to keep the data confidential which can be easily imported into the doctors EMR software. 

The only challenge with the readymade applications are they may not be matching all the requirements. Thus, there is always an option for custom based solution which can be developed by keeping the disaster recovery, HIPAA compliance and security in mind. 

I personally recommend the customized scalable solutions for healthcare industry considering the array of possible services and objectives of those institutions/service providers in this industry. Additionally, having a mobile-enabled solution not only keep you technically ahead in competition but also provides a next-level user experience and efficiency.

Yeah, this article is partisan as fuck. Maybe share something a little less  angsty.

That said, if anyone is curious about the origins/purpose of the tax: when the Democrats were crafting Obamacare in 2009, they needed it to be budget-neutral, according to the CBO. They wanted to raise half the money (approx $500-600 billion) through legisliation/taxes and the other half through industry contributions. Pharma, insurers, and hospitals all knew that healthcare reform - if done in certain ways - could spell disaster for the industries they controlled (e.g. pharma didn't want Medicare to be able to negotiate drug prices like insurers do, and it wanted long-lasting patents for a new kind of drug type called biosimilars). 

These industry players negotiated deals with the ones crafting the ACA in which they gave some hundreds of billions of dollars to help offset the cost of implementing Obamacare. This was pretty much all upside for these industries, since the ACA was going to increase coverage for Americans, thus giving more customers to insurers and giving more access to hospitals and drugs. All these players would be getting extra hundreds of billions, anyway, from the tens of millions of new customers. And they would give 50-60% of that to the government as kickbacks. So it's still 40-50% of hundreds of billions of dollars PLUS no industry-disrupting regulations.

Medical device manufacturers, on the other hand, didn't have any special interests they wanted to negotiate. They don't interface with the insured, since they sell their devices to hospitals. The increase in insurance coverage in America would result in more business for them, but there was nothing the ACA could really offer them regulation-wise. So the Democrats knew that they were just gonna need to hit device manufacturers with a tax rather than get negotiated kickbacks. The manufacturers would be getting a lot more business under the ACA as well, anyway.

healthcare,"Your arguments are all of the classic arguments that hospitals use to defend their revenues.  
  
Economics 101 and business pricing 101 tells you that a supplier's cost has no bearing on the price a buyer is willing to pay. Every single executive that runs a business know this. And every single nonprofit knows this as well.  
  
Hospital groups are experiencing record high profits, and are attempting to funnel them into capital expenditures because they are not allowed to distribute profits.  
  
It's clear as day. And I don't believe the hospitals' arguments about ""oh, but everything costs sooooo much"" for one second. It's a bunch of baloney. Hence I would like to give suing them a shot under whatever laws might be available (price gouging, etc) just to see what happens. Maybe nothing happens. But I'll give it a shot anyways."

Surgeons charge a high price because either the market supply of surgeons is low, or there are errors in the market like the absence of price transparency.

healthcare,"I worked in healthcare analytics and then at a major US electronic medical vendor for a while. It's crazy that data sharing is incredibly difficult even within the same healthcare organization.  We missed a big opportunity during Meaningful Use to force organizations to share data in a way that the recipient could easily upload into their system. Commonwell and Carequality are trying to provide better data exchange but the data they share doesn't flow into the other EHR and doctors/staff don't have the time in their days to review/process it.

In either case those solutions aren't patient centric and your data would still be controlled by each medical practice and not necessarily accessible to you, the patient. The blockchain has a lot of potential to provide the data security, data authenticity, and ease of sharing that we need to move things in a more patient centric direction and get rid of these ridiculous information gaps. There's a bunch of literature out there but this [paper](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/8-31-blockchain-ibm_ideation-challenge_aug8.pdf) by IBM does a nice job presenting the challenges in healthcare and some potential solutions.

The only time someone would be required to pay back the full amount of APTC is if they were receiving and using APTC throughout the year based on their projected income but actually ended up making more than 400% of the FPL.

healthcare,"MHA here too... and the son of an MHA...guess the apple didn't fall far :) 

you might want to start from the other direction - what do you feel called to do? What impact do you want to make in the world? What kind of work environment do you like and what kind or projects do you want to work on and with which types of people do you want to work? 

I've taken a bit of a contrarian path in my career. I lead innovation —change, improvement, re-inventing, fixing, making more human —for large health systems and hospitals. At least 3-4 times a year we've hosted undergrads and graduate students in our innovation center. I always ask them the same questions: 

A. describe the work environment you hope to have 
and
B. Why do you want to work in healthcare 

To the first question, without fail and with very little deviation I hear the same three things: 

1. I care more about projects than a stove pipe path - I want to go from neat project to neat project rather than following a linear path though management. 

2. I want to work around smart, fun, collaborative people in a fun environment. 

3. I want a modern work-life balance - I want to pick when and how I work. 

Now, those are my paraphrases, but the answers are remarkably consistent. 

To the second question, I've noticed a change. 10 years ago almost everyone spoke about some childhood experience or the experience of a family member that inspired them to want to improve healthcare. Today, I hear that less and less - more often, I hear that people think HC looks like a good, stable industry (ha!). It is, and that’s a fine answer. Just noting the change. 

The things to consider are these: health administration is increasingly about the administration part. Hospitals and systems are consolidating into larger and larger conglomerates. Having an MHA has become the ticket to play, but unlike 20 years ago or my dad's generation -when it virtually guaranteed a CEO job -today its required for manager positions. To that point, consider the ROI - what will the degree cost and how long will it take to get into a role where you can pay off the degree (unless you have the ability to go through school without much/any debt). 

Also, consider the pattern of answers I shared above. Almost every local hospital has an MHA grad (or 20) who'd love to have you shadow for a day or two. See what you can determine about the work environment and culture. I'm not trying to poison the proverbial well— I love the industry I've chosen even when it makes me frustrated beyond belief :) —but I think it's fair to say that healthcare is a very old, conservative, traditional industry. There aren't a lot of young people in administration and there aren't a lot of flexible, start-up-looking teams (although its the focus of my peers and I to try and change that). 

That, of course, can change if the next generation of healthcare leaders demands it and forged the path. 

To the later question - healthcare has opportunities galore. There's not much else, save for university administration, like it. It's like running a small city from food service delivery and construction to life-saving medicine and compress finances. If you are interested in operations, it can be for you. If you are interested in finance, investment or revenue cycle, it can be for you. If you are interested in complex 'system challenges', its certainly the place to be. 

If you are interested in making changes to a complex system that, often in spite of itself, still doesn't treat people —including those who work in the field —as fully human....then we need people like you. And you need to know the system is self-healing against change. It'll be a long climb. And there are lots of people intent on seeing health delivery, finance, operations, policy and care not change. 

And finally, if you are someone who wants to build something new...a new model, a new tech-based solution, a new tool or service....consider a different route. It doesn't have to be Silicon Valley, but it might look more like Walgreens or CVS or a consumer product company. That kind of change isn't going to come from inside the industry. 

Finally, with much respect for /u/tyguy131's experience and insight... I dont see much value in ACHE and it's fellowship program (the F) any more. I think it had it's time and place but we aren't seeing cutting edge leadership and change coming out of the ACHE. ... just my two cents :) "
healthcare,"Absolutely wonderful insight. The only reason I would recommend the ACHE is for networking purposes and getting experience from the start. I gained a lot of insight from other healthcare professionals in regards to what you can do with the MHA. The MACHE may be different experience from other ACHE chapters, however, which may skew my view of it compared to yours."
healthcare,"That’s a solid point about ACHE!

And realized in my referendum on the industry (jk!) I forgot to answer some of the OP’s direct questions. 

A good MHA program should have a residency component where you’ll get placed in an organization for about a year. That’s how most people start their MHA-based careers. 

Also things like ACHE, HIMMS and HFMA are great for networking. 

In the less traditional route, things like Stanford’s MedX community, FasterCures and the various tweet chats line #HCLDR are also great ways to network. 

As for work/life balance - I think that’s where some of my biggest challenges are for encouraging young people. We’ve modeled our culture off that of how we train doctors which itself is about 50 years out of date. So meetings often start at 7a and days can be 12 hour days at the senior level of organizations. That’s not universally true. But I see it enough that it’s worrisome. And because traditional bedside care happens, naturally, at the bed side, we tend to think everyone has to be present. If nurses have to be there then so does everyone else....to which is say: let’s find a way to have less people in the hospital entirely. 

All my cynicism aside...

It’s the largest part of our gross domestic product. It’s adding jobs consistently at a rate above the rest of the economy and it’s still the only industry that is fundamentally about humans taking care of humans with the goal of reducing pain and suffering.

healthcare,"MHA doesn’t guarantee anything in the industry. I’ve worked in healthcare for over 20 years and have worked my way from staff to CEO. When I asked this same advice many years I was told to just get my MBA because you never know what’s going to happen.  What will make a difference in your career is your experience and how you conduct yourself. Always stand by your moral convictions and always do right by the patient.  Don’t show up looking for a paycheck. If you don’t like people and don’t genuinely care for your fellow man, then you should consider another field. "
healthcare,"Excellent points about how much simpler Improved Medicare for All would be for us when we need care.  I think the most underrated argument is the freedom of not having healthcare tied to certain jobs.  Not all jobs offer insurance benefit and if your job does, it could be dropped, the benefit changes each year, the deductible resets or you might get laid off.  The next recession would be somewhat less stressful if people didn't lose their job and health insurance.  Such a cruel double whammy that we keep tolerating for some masochistic reason.

It's great to identify problems with the VA and Medicare so they can be fixed and not repeated in a system for all.  To point them out and say it can't be done is not helpful and not how we've accomplished many great things and solved problems in the past."
healthcare,"This is another example of why we need Improved Medicare For All!

Lots of good points that really illustrate many links between addictions, jobs and healthcare.  When someone struggles with one of those, the other two become less stable and it's a vicious cycle.

This work requirement idea is another cruel dream of the gop.  There aren't that many unemployed, fully-healthy people getting Medicaid for an extended period of time.  If they are getting unemployment or other social support they already have to show job search effort.  The cost to monitor and administer the work requirement, enrollment and re-enrollment will cancel out any savings from denying the few people who are fully healthy.

Their real hope is that a lot of people who *do* qualify will get kicked off and won't have the will or knowledge to jump through the hoops to get enrolled and maintain enrollment.  They think if you aren't financially successful it's your own fault, are just a drain on society and will die sooner without healthcare.  Sadly too many people agree with that and don't consider that getting healthcare is the only way some people will be able to get back to work, but kick that leg out from under them anyway."

healthcare,"Hello!

I stumbled across your post, I hope you were able to get this resolved. I work a lot with health insurance.

Let me clarify some information for you regarding the Nurse Practitioner. Nurse Practitioners and Physician's Assistants are not usually contracted directly with insurance in the US. NPs and PAs work directly under doctors, and claims are submitted with the doctor's information. In this case it sounds like the NP works under a Specialist.

The information that you want to track down at this point is which physician  the NP works under, and how are they contracted with your insurance. If the physician is a specialist, you will want to reach out to your doctor's office to see if the NP can also bill under your PCP. If they can resubmit the claim under your PCPs Name, that would be ideal and you would only be responsible for the PCP copay.

Please let me know if you have any questions!"
healthcare,"We had this happen when my wife needed surgery for her cancer. I had to argue and threaten to contact the  hospital admin and board to get them to drop it. Even though we pay nearly 35% of our income on health insurance we don't qualify for subsidies because my wife's employer offers a ""cheap"" Individual plan (Less than 9.5% of income) but there are no rules on how much a ""family"" plan can cost. If she didn't have that we would qualify for a subsidy... :( 

I wish the United States would pursue Universal Health Coverage. This year my wife and I spent $19,000+ on health insurance and medical bills which is over 35% of our income. Next year it'll be much higher with her having cancer, etc. 

My wife just had surgery and one of the doctors turned out to be out-of-network after the told us they were in-network. So we got a surprise $4k bill. American healthcare is pure surprise and robbery even if you do your best to prevent it as the prices are unknown.

If you want to see a typical ""Excellent"" relatively cheap American FAMILY healthcare plan, take a look at this. 

https://imgur.com/a/dJ8hL 

Basically $982.51/month for a family to be paid by the employee, and $946.93 to be paid by the employer. For a grand total of $1929.44/month for the ""BASE"" plan. This has a $2,500 deductible and a $5,000 max out of pocket! 

If you want the upgraded plan it is only $1,213.08/month for the employee, and $946.93 for the employer for a grand total of $2,160.01/month. This only has a $3,000 Deductible/Max out of pocket! 

So not counting the employer contributions, below is what it would cost a typical employee within a 12 month period if they were maximize their benefits. 

So the base plan is only $11,790.12/per year + $5,000 Max out of pocket for a grand total of $16,790.12 for all IN-NETWORK services!!! If you have to go OUT-OF-NETWORK then it is only another $10,000, so worse case scenario you are ONLY out $26,790.12 for the year. 

If you want the upgraded premium plan it is only $14,556.96/per year + $3,000 Max out of pocket for a grand total of $17,556.96/per year for all IN-NETWORK services! If you have to go out of network then it is another $12,000 so that brings the worse case scenario to $29,556.96 for the year. 

Typical American Healthcare Insurance! And this is only for things that are covered by health insurance and approved by the insurer. If it is not billed correct or covered then you are on the hook for 100% of those charges. 

So you can see how someone with insurance, even good insurance, can be in deep financial distress just from paying the premiums, let alone using the insurance. 

"
healthcare,"Healthcare worker here. 

Premiums are skyrocketing because the healthy support the growing sick population  (boomers) with our premiums. Universal healthcare will shove the costs elsewhere, but doesn't address the root problems. Healthcare costs need to be addressed first, or your will receive ""free"" universal healthcare that isn't very good OR you'll receive ""free"" Healthcare and will need to bribe doctors to receive adequate care (see eastern europe). 


Our situation blows, but we need to address the root of the problem  (why is this stuff so expensive??!) Instead if just shuffling costs around. "
healthcare,"Very good points.  Right now we are negotiating with the hospitals to try to lower the bills as we are unable to afford it with my wife having cancer, us having 2 kids, and me being unemployed for 6 months.  I hope that all the financial paperwork I filled out the past two weeks amounts to something. "
healthcare,"Afaik, this has really been standard practice for quite a while. The organization I'm involved with has pretty substantial evidence that collecting up front is a much better practice for the hospital as the chance of reimbursement from the patient after the fact drops significantly.

The only part that really starts to irritate me is when they come up with an estimate of your patient responsibility, they don't take into account that the hospital bill is the one that's being paid last by insurance. If you are fairly close to meeting your deductible, or if your procedure is just expensive, The Physician bills will bump you into your out-of-pocket where you're covered at a higher percent which means you end up paying the hospital a portion of the funds that really should be going to the physician and then you have to go through the hassle of getting a refund in some instances."

Boomers were in their prime at the left and the US still had the highest rates in the world. This isn’t a new problem, this is an old problem that keeps getting worse.

Other countries have obesity, they have bad food, they have boomers. Private healthcare is the thing that makes the top line different. It’s the root you’re looking for.

Capitalism is the best system on the planet but it only works when customers have choices and can leave a provider when it sucks. Water, power, cable and healthcare don’t have choices, so the free market doesn’t function. So costs are artificially high."
healthcare,Look up Quadramed.  Great identity management.
healthcare,"I agree with you, but can't tell if you're supporting my point? 


The root problem is cost of healthcare. But healthcare costs are so high because of regulations, lack of competition, and other constraints on the market. 

Free market capitalism, In my personal opinion, is the solution. You can see it in services like lasik, plastic surgery, and orthotics. They openly advertise lower prices, and deal little with regulations and insurance providers as middlemen. 

Also, ask yourself this: why is a surgery for your dog 5-10k, when that same surgery on a human is over 100k? The tools and anesthetics are the same, the complications are the same, what makes them so dramatic in Prices?!


Regulations. 

People are eager to blame insurance companies and hospitals for the lack of affordable care, when their profit margins are, In actuality, very low. Insurance and hospitals are held captive in a non-free market system and try their best to keep the doors open. "

I wouldn't recommend waiting until you find a root cause for this emotional dryness so much as trying to find what does stir some feelings for you.

Volunteer at a hospital or at a local charity and see if that can help you feel compassion.  Or, go see a friend or a family member and truly invest some time in getting to know what is going on with them - perhaps one or all of these things can help get you out of this funk and on to better/greater things.  

Also, if you have something that you have been repressing for a while and that constant repression has caused you to feel less vivacity in other areas of your life, it may be time to confide in someone close to you or someone with some emotional intelligence."

healthcare,"So what your essentially proposing is the following:
The first $10,000 is out of pocket (from a patient perspective essentially a $10k deductible)

Then your insurance kicks in, and will cover you until you reach $125k...

Then the fed government picks up the rest- is that correct?"
healthcare,"Yes, you are missing catastrophic events. "
healthcare,"thats what Medicare for all and Sharing take care of: Anything from $125,000 and above"
healthcare,"No, not a 10K deductible.  If you spread out the risk across all Americans, then you can get up to $10,000 in yearly care for $25/mth. ($300 out of pocket per year).  "
healthcare,"You said 500k max- life time? Annual? "
healthcare,"Annually.  I'm sure there would be some life time max like there is today. "
healthcare,"500k is one encounter in some cases. So what happens to people who spend $550,001 of Medicare coverage ?"

Assuming they average $100-$250K above the $500K, then anywhere from $3 to $12 per month into a sharing pool by individual families (this doesn't include kids who obviously can't pay) pays for people that exceed this coverage.

Many of the people involved in high level decisions in this area aren't, the majority of the rest would argue for days how the profession of a closely related colleague means they really aren't the right kind of profession for the job anyway, and the rest have spent enough time to recognize they are professionals in a tiny piece of the vast interrelated system.

1 basic. I like the idea of covering general care, preventative care, ""basic"" care, the sorts of things that should go without saying. The things that public health students learn day one, that economics majors use as case studies, it's the arithmetic of health. Are screenings cost efficient? Generally, yes. Are nutritional guidelines a net positive? For sure.  Is going to the doctor if that cold persists a bit beyond what you're used to a good idea? Yeah. Annual physical, vaccinations, prenatal care, check check check. Funding these are clear wins. This ""first dollar"" of care is always the most valuable, it's a rule of logic.  It's right out of the book.

And we all know this. Yet, time after time and study after study back up the one main thing: it just doesn't happen. It takes ten times the investment to actually encourage seeking the type of care we all know is good. Smoking, obesity, childhood vaccines, we see over. And over. And over again that just because it's a good idea, the bottom dollar logic isn't going to work. Don't even look at health. Free IRS assistance for taxes is available to every American, have you filed your 1040? Never mind irs, private industries are required to provide it. Still, I know friends and family who shrug and say ""sure"" when h&amp;r block offers their minimum package. Pay the 25 a month in, you don't even cover the cost of a website that says ""AND HERE'S HOW TO USE IT"" never mind the ""NO REALLY YOU SHOULD USE IT"" site. 

2 comprehensive care. This gets into complexity. Because, no matter what you say about the insurance industry, it has created it's own mathematics for healthcare.  I was looking at a job promotion at my workplace a few months ago, and in my ""well I better sign up for this to pretend I care"" I signed up (for free) to the healthcare compliance association. Their newsletter is gobbledygook. It's coding and cross coding and I swear the articles are literally saying ""save/make money by calling x, y."" But incomprehensibly. Because healthcare isnt actually fee for service, you don't actually buy ""an Echo"" or""*specific kind* heart surgery"". There really are different prices for different people. One patient came in with family history of a certain illness and you could pass him right along to the surgeon. The next, well it could be this, it could be that, we can test for this but that indicated the third thing which it can't be because, oh wait okay her fourth doctor caught the correct symptoms and passes her to the same surgeon for the same surgery that suddenly actually cost a WHOLE lot more. Not to mention, there really are networks, partnerships and bulk discounts. There really is a doctor out there who will advise the best course of action as bedrest and strong broth, and another who loads up antibiotics and three nights in the hospital (and there really are hospitals where a cotton swab is tied to the nurses salary, or where the jello was part of a federal research grant, or where they bought the fanciest diagnostic machinery that is overserving the population so might as well double check for that thing that only has a tiny percentage chance to be be worth checking (except, wait, wasn't ""screening"" on our list of basic worthwhile care? Any care, of any kind, is only ever worthwhile for a specific population, artificially ballooning that population doesn't help)

This is part of the point of

3 medicaid for all (because that's what you're really saying, we say Medicare because it's a pleasant fiction we provide better for our elderly than our needy it's the same. Government, standard and impartial coverage based on criteria we can all potentially fit and all pay into). The guidelines for Medicare/aid program are MASSIVE and impact EVERY. SINGLE. ASPECT. of providing healthcare in the us. It's not the gold standard of healthcare, it is the only standard. It is the benchline practice, the minimum essential coverage, the ""multiple of two odd numbers is an odd number"" every doctor has these patients, every healthcare administrator has these patients, every insurer has these patients and marks others against them, and nearly every person will become one of these patients. But let's also recognize that one of the things to love about these programs is the rules, the guideline they provide to get to the ""next step"" of care. How long can grandma stay in the hospital for pneumonia? Three days, then rehab, home care, or maybe we need to identify a co-factor. How much can X drug cost? Well, did they try Y first? Okay then this much. It covers all 1,2 and 3 of your ""tiers,"" saying it ""kicks in"" at a dollar amount misses the point of it, it only makes sense when it covers A-Z. 

4 sharing so, this is the equality plan equal for everyone equally. Except these folks. They're more equal. 

5 prescription excluding pharmaceuticals would be awesome. No arguments here. Only way you could have gotten me more on board was if you said they'd all have tits and be on fire, and that we are banning Rx commercials. 

I think you're focusing on the solution, seeing only the endpoint, at the ""ultimate"" $ cost of care, and ignore how you got there. Medicine can't have a logic of ""well, this person hit their basic level 10k and now has to work with their private insurer who... Oh wait, different network/guidelines/actually just decided not to buy this"" until they hit the ""now it's all covered by the people as a whole"" 

""We spend too much"" and should spend ""less"" isn't actually an answer, it's just rephrasing the problem. "
healthcare,"the term out-of-pocket is not defined with premium, which you're doing $25/month or $300 year. there is a cost of insurance, we call this premium. out-of-pocket refers to expenses incurred from services rendered.
most can't see past their doctor co-pay for an office visit, nor do they want to. all everyone wants is something easy, simple, and cheap.

i am in the industry."
healthcare,"I guess this is where measures like MACRA and Value based healthcare are pointing us in the right direction. Away from fee-for-service. More towards reducing readmission rates, evidence based healthcare, better clinical decision support. 

Incentivizing better patient outcome on a provider level is better at reducing healthcare costs than trying to figure out some universal one size fits all rule. It’s also better for the beneficiaries! People have to understand the quality measures and data as a whole before they determine how much $$ to spend. Preventative care is the best and most affordable care. "

healthcare,"I had kind of thought making a statement followed by examples of how that statement is true was explaining, but sure. Jessica has the flu, and decides that this ain't the life and she'll treat herself. She's been doing pretty well at work and has a little extra socked away, and decides that curing this flu is what she'll spend it on. How much will Jessica spend? Well, first she has to go to a doctor (what one? Where? Urgent Care clinic or regular appointment, or does she hit up the ER cause it's a really bad flu? Is it actually a really bad flu, or just a particularly nasty regular one?) Regardless of where she goes, she will pay a copay, or the full cost of the appointment, and those will be different depending not even on which type of clinic she visits, but which specific one. This is getting in the door. Then the doctor, well maybe she just sees a PA, prescribes a drug or, well maybe not. And what kind of drug? What if she's allergic to that one? What if she's not a pill taker and wants the liquid kind? Designer or off brand? What if her flu is actually bad enough she has to be hospitalized? 

Certainly, at the end of the day, you can chalk everything up and hand Jessica a bill, but these are notoriously dense and illogical. She's probably not really paying THAT either through insurance or lower cash payments. 

And that's a gross oversimplification of the flu, which comes around every year and hits, like, everyone. (did Jessica get her yearly flu shot?)"
healthcare,"yeah I understand that. I wasn't trying to confuse the situation. I was trying to point out there is no out of pocket expenses in the Basic Care "
healthcare,[removed]
healthcare,"Who would insure you today?  All health plans have a lifetime maximum (usually $1M) so if you have an extreme chronic issue over a couple few years, you are going to exceed that amount.  There are Cancer patients who's prescription drugs are more than $100,000/yr.  With the Chemo and other costs, you will out pace your maximum.  Then what?  What exists today to resolve that?  Nothing, except hope.  

This was the idea behind Sharing.  I have a Medical Sharing Plan today.  My medical costs are covered.  And people in the plan understand; ""You do share yourself, you don't get a share."" So everyone does.  Under this new plan, there would be a place people can go to ask for help.  "
healthcare,[removed]
healthcare,[removed]
healthcare,"I agree I am probably focusing on the end state, but that is the engineer in me.  I looked at the actual costs and said how do you categorize those costs into buckets of expenses then develop plans to pay for them.  

This would have to be Public/Private overall solution.  Government would have to changes laws completely to implement, so yeah, its probably a pipe dream. So if we look at Basic Care, by government establishing that insurance is not available for anything below $10,000, you let the free market come up with solutions, such as Doctor Concierge care, large companies (Apple, etc.) having their own doctor practices, etc. Basically, government isn't involved here (except for fraud and malpractice but all the risks for malpractice have mostly been removed because of the $10,000 restriction). So now people have to engage in their care.  

As for the others, I appreciate your input.  I agree the whole medical practice is a mess.  I am an independent contractor so I have to seek medical care from the Exchange and watching what has happened to care there is why I now have my medical insurance through a Health Sharing Medical Plan. But even on the Doctor side, I have a family member that is a mental health provider who has been trying to get on the insurance plans as a provider.  It has taken 6 months and still has not gotten on the plans.  Worse yet, Aetna approved them on the plan, then without warning, had removed them from the plan due to a paperwork error and my family member was unable to collect medical expenses for 4 months of work. Its like the insurance companies are fighting to not pay for customer medical care and doing what they can to prevent providers from being able to give care.  And I don't totally fault the insurance companies. I know they are greedy but at the same time, they are working within the insurance market defined by the convoluted mess the government has wrought. Then, as you say there are Doctors who are honest brokers and those that maximize their insurance claims. 

I know many people say this is why we need single payer healthcare, but ever time I hear that I see Veterans Administration Healthcare for all and that is down right frightening as hell. 

Its why I was concentrating on the Basic Care and the Sharing being open to everyone.  Removing 99% of the risk factors effecting insurance today and making Basic Care a completely market driven service will dynamically change how we provide preventive and basic care.  That change I believe would ripple to the other areas of care.  With Sharing being a safety net for everyone, the other portions of care could be adapted over time.  My hope would be the Basic care transition would impacts the way care is provided in the insurance and Medicare markets. 

However, the truth is, I see the real answer to complete healthcare replacement through the use of Blockchain technology.  Not Bitcoin, Ethereum, where Doctors, medical facilities and hospitals are all a share of the system and where the purchase of ""care"" results in the value given to providers improving the quality of care at a lower price. An Ethereum based Blockchain medical market could completely eliminate the need for government and insurance companies."

healthcare,"as stated previously, there is no lifetime maximum limits post 2012 per the PPACA"
healthcare,"I was thinking about this a bit more immediately after I hit post this morning (sorry if my start had seemed snarky, pre-coffee).  I think you and I are looking at the product being purchased differently, because when I look at ""the cotton ball"" or ""the test itself"" being the product, then it clearly is a fee for service (though I think we'd both say an incredibly complicated one where neither the provider nor patient have a clear idea of the fee) whereas I was trying to emphasize the product purchased as the goal of these services: health. I just don't see many people lining up at doctors offices for the latest and greatest test, their demand for the test follows from the demand for health, and I'd still argue here that there isn't a fee for service system for that particular product. 

I might be wrong, but is it possible we're just disagreeing on definitions?"
healthcare,Obamacare banned insurers from imposing lifetime maximums.
healthcare,"healthcare is a fee for service driven model, period. there's a whole system of codes, actually a couple systems if codes to classify a given service. one of those is called CPT codes. depending on the service there can be levels, for example level shoulder surgery, level 2 shoulder surgery and so on. these are often accompanied by more codes (for services) like the tissue, Kleenex, or injection. 

also, I'd beg to differ on the people running out there for the latest and greatest test. while this is a broad statement and if we spoke on Rx specifically, you will find people do buy brand much of the time because they think it works better (I have my own personal experience with this but now isn't the time). providers push the latest and greatest in terms if drugs for many reasons but highest in the list is, you guessed it kick-backs. people rarely question doctors on choice of this or that. heck, most people have horse blinders on in general let alone wanting to learn more about a given prescription or why this x-ray was used and not another."
healthcare,"Fair enough. I was not aware of that.  "
healthcare,"Couple of points 

The reason the VA sucks is that congress doesn’t believe their funding should be continuous 

The problem with us healthcare in general is not the insurance. It’s that we expect capitalism to solve everything and capitalism only works when customers have choices and most healthcare choices are made by someone/something else

The USA doesn’t exist in a vacuum. The rest of the world already figured this out. We need only choose one (or more) of those systems or hire them to administrate ours"
healthcare,"&gt; who pays the first 10k? missing you there.

Everyone does, its just done through standard actuarial risk to create a monthly fee.  And since the vast majority of potential cost risk has been removed from the equation, the cost for the monthly fee drops like a rock.  

Yes government will likely never leave or stop interfering that is true. 

&gt; can apply blockchain tech to nearly everything

And that's exactly why it has appeal. Many people think of the Blockchain in terms of Bitcoin.  But the reality is the Blockchain provides cryptographically ENFORCED dual and third part contracts. A contract that can't be broken. It means we see publicly every transaction to understand all the dynamics within the system. You can actually build the fraud prevention rules into the contracts themselves and prevent unauthorized or unethical billing or even price changes for services. We can measure the quality of care through transactional analysis and a multitude of other capabilities.  Where the internet was the world changing event of the 1980's, the blockchain is the world changing event of the 2010's
"
healthcare,"&gt; The reason the VA sucks is that congress doesn’t believe their funding should be continuous

yes but if the government had Single Payer, it too would have to be appropriated each year like the VA now so, that a moot point. And you are making the argument for why the government shouldn't be doing Single payer in the first place.  But yes, I generally agree with your other points. "
healthcare,"Here’s a better solution: Keep America’s privately-run hospitals and clinics, have a single, publicly-run insurer for everyone and use their concentrated market power to drive down prices (for example, Medicare for all), and only allow private insurance around the sidelines for non-essential care and reimbursement (like what AFLAC does now as supplemental health or to cover acupuncture, etc.). Billing departments, marketing costs, and other related overhead expenses would not be as potentially large as they are now or in your example because the multi-payer system would no longer exist in the scale it currently does with its layers and layers of networks and policies.

This is how most other developed countries do it. Let’s follow what works for other nations with less cost and better outcomes than us."

healthcare,"I need to review your numbers previously shown with premiums for $300 year. just out of curiosity, if one only spends $25 a month and can receive up to 10k in services, what would keep them from abusing the system? H.R.A. comes to mind with that idea and believe me you, the employees know all too well if they don't use it, they lose it. 

in response to your blockchain comment and internet/era correlation- word. 
shared view on application of blockchain and I a bit more. back to premiums and a Medicare style setup, where consumer accrues credits/coins instead of cash. the coins can only be used for medical care and therefore outside of taxation. credits earned through work just like now and those unable to work are given enough to satisfy their needs from the pool, but only on the basis of checks and balances on care provided previously and similar qualifications to Medicaid. part of the issue here is an increasing population and those who float outside of the system already. many of my ideas rely on heavy enrollment numbers to work, heck that's how insurance risk is spread now."

do you really believe anyone working in government sector positions dealing with the general public enjoy their job? do you think if nurses were paid more at the VA care would be better? how about the DMV? pay those people more and they will perform better? I say no. there is ZERO accountability or oversight with any operation the government has a hand in. exactly why I believe capitalism does work where only the strong survive and consumer directs the market. PPACA has the market directing the consumer. people need more control of where their healthcare dollars go"
healthcare,"AFLAC is the biggest pile of garbage in our industry. "
healthcare,"If you want to read a very interesting and informed book about alternative healthcare models, check out T.R. Reid's The Healing of America.  You'd enjoy it, especially if you're willing to start asking this kind of question."
healthcare,"In that very first post, I recognized the coding (I did so flippantly in an attempt at humor, sorry) but if the goal is to establish categories of care, and delineate these into levels of care, my point was that we can't start with the fee for service model, as it just doesn't reflect what people go to the doctor for. Sure, brand name Rx can be an exception to A LOT of my assumptions (and I'm making a lot of assumptions) which is probably why OP put them in their own category. But no, you're just not going to convince me that a patient really really wants to buy a cotton swab at the doctor's office  They'll be charged for it, but they're trying to buy health and that swab was a piece of getting to that health.  The ultimate dollar amount we're looking at from those services and the codes,  (as pointed out by others) might need to change  Those blinders you mention are part of the problem with just looking at what the end dollar amount is. "
healthcare,Great Thanks!
healthcare,"The number came from the breakdown of health expenditures from the government statistics, insurance company public stock filings, industry statistical analysis from multiple groups, all of which allows some classification of what amounts of the actual delivery of medical services is truly an expense.  We supposedly spend $3.2T on health care when in reality the expenditure of care in about $1.8T while the other stuff is government admin, VA, R&amp;D and other things not directly related to administered care. Then using the statistical analysis data to create cost pools.  Then dividing those cost pools by the number of users in the pool.  The basic care actually comes out to be more like $9-$11 per person, but with admin, fees, taxes and profit I bumped it to $25.  As for people using healthcare more, that's likely, but there are only so many doctors for people to see and triage/scheduling will limit the over use. 

yes the Blockchain approach is not something that can just suddenly happen. It has to work in concert with what exists today and be offered as an option that hopefully grows and replaces what is here now.  The likely solution is a Dual Coin approach where Providers operate on a [Proof of Stake](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/proof-work-proof-stake-explained/) system and there is a direct relation to a Stable Coin ($1 stable value) that is used to purchase medical care.

healthcare,"I agree. That’s why we should push private insurance on the sidelines and make it completely optional to sign up. It’s expensive if you factor in marketing and private equity demands, then they start to factor in other ways of competing with each other once the market is made up of only a few large competitors, such as by offering lifestyle incentives, free blood pressure monitors for enrollees, etc.

I’m thinking private insurers will begin tacking on international healthcare networks once single-payer is implemented in the U.S. to make it more attractive for enrollees. This is how it’s done in most other rich countries — private insurance is just travel insurance and short-term disability (or accident insurance) for a bit more money."
healthcare,"obvious comment is obvious.  no one wants to spend money on anything they don't want to. why are cotton swabs any different? because the hospital provides them they're just part of some kind of pricing structure that is inconceivable? those are actually inventory and there is a cost of goods and cost of goods sold, hence fee for service and the hundreds of thousands codes.

as for your next statement about buying health, this is the misconception when the consumer receives healthcare across all levels of care, from the cotton swabs to the surgery to physical exam and of course those prescriptions one takes. you can't buy health and while I don't like to get morbid, you're dying the moment you're born."
healthcare,that's screwy and yes you got screwed. I know what's going on here and I can imagine new benefits started 2/1. the broker or HR has about 5-7 days following the effective date to have everything scrubbed and submitted. someone is just being uptight on your end
healthcare,"i would tell you that you can't push private insurers to the sidelines for a number of reasons but we'll run with your thought, which is ultimately money.  many seem to forget insurers are not your friends (neither are doctors) and they're in business for revenue. as i said in a previous thread here, there's a cost of goods sold and doing business. without these monies, insurers will fail.  i will be the first to admit insurers are shady mofo's with a butt-ton of excess money but this is how the system has been designed more recently because of the PPACA.  not sure how much you understand of our nationwide public health exchange but in my state of California, 4 out of 5 applicants receive premium assistance (PTC or premium tax credits).  here's a real world example- single 39 year old woman making 28k a year has a standard premium of 600/m but receives 400/m in premium assistance. that insurance plan still costs 600 a month.  who is paying that? and where do you think it's going?  sheer stupidity if you ask me especially since this 39 year old woman could have spent that same amount of money on premium 8 years ago and received much richer benefit (yes with underwriting clause). most people received benefits from work, heck is part of the reasons for getting a job here or there but now it's now the case and the benefits are gone down in richness and costs increases. again, why do you think that is and where is it going?  

optional enrollment will only produce people buying insurance to cover surgeries and big expenses, the risk pool will not be satisfied.  i think there should be more of a auto insurance type program, where one could buy ""full coverage"" includes all the bells and whistles and then another could buy ""liability only"" type of coverage.  fyi, there's a butt-ton of fraud in auto insurance claims and guess part of the reason why? because one can setup their auto policy anytime.

i refuse to compare our healthcare to that of other countries with significantly less population.  not mentioning other factors for time sensitivity. i would be here for hours going on about this country and that country when all everyone cares about is their endpoint. how this affects me, me, me and my wallet."

healthcare,"Oh one other point. You have to be careful about the numbers provided.  A number of times they embed data you don't want.  For example: In 2010 Cancer costs the US $157B, but a portion of that (don't remember the actual number but is somewhere around $60B) is to account for lost wages and work. So that actual medical costs is around $100B.  Same thing is true with the $3.2T healthcare cost in the US. When in reality the money spend on medical services to customers is about $1.8T. So you have to be careful how you use the numbers. "

healthcare,How can I get involved in this project?
healthcare,"It is becoming increasingly common for providers of any practice to stop accepting insurance and only accept cash payments due to the reduced rates that insurance companies are paying providers directly. They charge the patient and then the patient can submit the bills to their insurance company on their own or through an advocate.

I've been in the medical billing field for over 20 years and my providers are (mostly) not contracted with any insurance company. I also deal with a lot of patients in my patient advocacy business that simply pay the cash to go to the better doctors, doctors who KNOW they are better, and thus feel they are worth more money than what the insurance companies want to pay. Which, I agree with. 

Example: One patient sees a mental health provider, pays $250 per visit, ins co reimburses the patient what they consider normal and customary which is about $85. No provider wants to accept that insane lowball amount, especially when they only see 6-8 patients a day. 

I am very pro-physician and anti-insurance company, doctor's are not ""rich"" the way they once used to be known as. It's sad when I see myself making more money some years than actual physicians. "
healthcare,"Why do you feel like you need insurance to sit down and talk with someone about your mental health? Insurance should be for emergency claims -- hospital visits, surgeries, accidents, etc... Do you have insurance for regular maintenance and repairs on your car? Why do you for your mind/body?

The system we have, where A pays C so that when A goes to B, A doesn't have to pay B out of pocket, is messed up. A should just pay B for most things, and have C in case of emergencies."
healthcare,"Wtf are you talking about? Office visits with an in-network psychiatrist (and in my case, a portion of out of network costs) are a clearly dilineated benefit in my insurance contract.  The insurance company covers it so that they don’t have to pay for an in-patient hospital stay if someone with mental health issues, say, tries to kill themselves instead."
healthcare,Thank you so much for the advice! I was convinced that debt collectors would be knocking on my door or something. Will call the lab.
healthcare,"I will say that I’m glad that I paid the extra money for the initial visit bc my doctor is fantastic and $100 for a follow up every three months or so isn’t terrible at my income.  Still, the idea that someone out there could thinking of doing something really terrible and has no access to mental healthcare is frightening."
healthcare,"I'm trying to make the point that we misuse the term ""insurance"" for the way we manage payments in our health care system. It's not really insurance when we tap into it every time we receive care, it's more of a brokerage service. Having this 3rd party involved creates problems, like when a provider doesn't want to deal with them.

My assertion is that normal, predictable visits should be paid for directly by the patient, not by the insurer. Only unexpected care should be paid for by insurance, and only then when the cost exceeds a certain amount."
healthcare,So you’re just whining about semantics?  Health insurance plans have included preventative care for decades.  They keep healthcare costs lower by incentivizing enrollees to keep themselves in better health.  Are you seriously suggesting someone on Medicaid should be covered for going to the hospital after slitting their wrists open but not for the antidepressants/psychotherapy that could have prevented a suicide attempt?
healthcare,"I don't recall mentioning any Medicaid recipients -- I was talking about people with health insurance who can't get an appointment for lack of providers. You had mentioned that the ""cash only"" clinic got you in within days.

I have bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed 10 years ago. I've dealt with our horseshit health care system along with insurance during that time. I've tried with mixed success to develop a good relationship with a psychiatrist. It's obvious to me that our current insurance system doesn't work very well.

healthcare,I don't pay the copay directly to the hospital. They deduce the copay from what they pay to the hospital. I realized it when the hospital sent me a bill that was basically $150 to high. Does that clarify it?
healthcare,"Because health insurance in the US is a mess. I've been trying to figure it our for a week, Can't find any insurance, state website never picks up the phone and I can no longer stay undermy parent's plan since they retired a few months ago. I wish Amazon would offer insurance. "
healthcare,"I think I'm following what you're saying...

So the way your insurance works is like; at the actual time and date of your medical office visits/treatments/Hospital visit/stay etc. you pay nothing to the providing doctor and/or med. facility you don't pay squat to the providing doctor for his services rendered to you directly. 
Then after the appointment/procedure/etc has already been performed. The Dr sends the ""bill"" (or 'reimbursement claim'  in insurance talk) for the amount being charged for that particular service. 
Your insurer receives the claim/bill from the Dr and insurance guy then pays the dr then sends the dr his payment which is $150 less than whatever the total charged amount listed in the billing/claim statement.  (With that remaining  amount left unpaid of $150 being the patients copay responsibility?)

healthcare,"Ugh, “circumcision”. What a waste of money."
healthcare,"NPs can absolutely bill for specialty services. There are specialist NPs at most specialty offices who have trained under and alongside specialists and some NPs who even have a degree or post graduate certificate in a specialty (all of us have some sort of designator and focus during school which makes a huge difference - family practice, acute care, emergency medicine, women's health, gerontology, to name a few and there are many specialty fellowships and advanced practice certificates that some NPs get in addition to their masters or doctorate degrees hospice, HIV, diabetes, oncology, neonatal, etc.) Insurance oftentimes pays these specialty visits at a % of what they would pay a physician for billing for those codes.  I think the range I've heard is around 60-90% depending on the insurance company (haven't really been on the billing side of things yet but excited to get more into that! Well... Maybe excited isn't the right word, but it just has to be done if we as practitioners are going to be able to make this flawed system work for our patients.) I'm suspicious that OPs PCP's office is one of the many where the billing decisions are being made by someone who doesn't give a shh about the patients."
healthcare,This is the fault of the PCP office or the NP.  You have to make sure you are listed under the NPI of the PCP clinic or else you're billed as a specialist.
healthcare,"Regardless of what certificates an NP may have they cannot be a specialist because, in medicine, that term implies you passed specialty board exams (eg cardiology). Regardless of whether you work along side a specialist, that doesn’t make you a specialist. Insurance will often pay a percentage of the coded bill by a mid level working under a specialist, but that isn’t equivalent to billing the actual patient the copay at the full cost of a specialist. Especially if the patient never saw a specialist and, as in this case, the supervising PCP isn’t a specialist (so even a chart signature would not elevate it) . "

Especially if the patient never saw a specialist and, as in this case, the supervising PCP isn’t a specialist (so even a chart signature would not elevate it) . 

This is pretty much my line of thinking. Even if the NP that treated me happens to moonlight at the office/practice of a specialist, that isn't the capacity or circumstance that they were in when I was being treated at my PCP/GP's office. Therefore, it is not correct to charge me the co-pay for seeing a specialist when I was making a standard PCP/GP office visit."
healthcare,"Have you actually seen the Explanation of benefits on this claim?  And did the insurance actually treat the NP as a specialist?  
You could look the NP  up by NPI number and see his/her/their classification.  
It will be time consuming but you should probably contact your insurance provider and ask for a case manager.  
Also, you should have received a Summary of Benefits when you got your insurance that probably has the answer to your questions.  If you don’t have this, you can request from HR.  "

healthcare,I like it :)
healthcare,"My GP/PCP is part of a larger hospital/company/health care system in our city that is in network with my insurance provider, and it is that hospital/company/health care system that sent me the bill and is stating their NP is a specialist. I talked with my insurance provider as well and they said that the visit was billed as a specialist, and that if I only paid my regular Dr.'s office visit co-pay at a specialist's office then that office/provider/company would bill me for the balance/remainder of the co-pay for seeing a specialist. 

The bill I received was not itemized, but I was able to get a verbal break down of what my insurance provider covered and what they did not. According to that health care provider billing dept., I'm still on the hook for the other half of the specialist co-pay + $0.18 of the nebulizer breathing treatment that my insurance didn't pick up."
healthcare,"Where I live, RNs start at 18/hr which is why I'm going straight through school. Is the pay better for you?"
healthcare,"In medicine, yes, but this is nursing and insurance companies we're talking about. Notice how all i said was that NPs can bill for specialty services? It's the cpt code that matters here. I see people talking about NPI numbers, but that only tells you NP vs PA vs MD vs DO, nothing about specialization. Totally agree that OP is getting screwed here though. We're all pretty much on the same page with that."
healthcare,"Thank you everyone for helping me clarify some of this. I'm going to call back and throw my new found knowledge back on them, and if they refuse to drop the whole ""specialist"" thing I'll get my insurance provider more involved."
healthcare,"Thank you, I appreciate your perspective and it's good to hear that there isn't a big disparity in people's opinions of either degree.  I will probably take the path of MPH, bc personally that is what interests me.  My clinical background and work experience (have done some QI projects between clinicians and public health) has allowed me the ability to go back and forth between public health and the healthcare side pretty fluidly that some of my peers with only an MPH have not been able to do.  So, you're right, past experiences, networking and hard work do count.  Thanks again!"

healthcare,"Oh my, yes. Much, much better. As a staffing agency RN (so you get to have 100% flexibility in your schedule) I started at 38/hr in Seattle."
healthcare,"At this point I disagree. I attended an apointment/visit at my regular GP/PCP doctor, not a specialist. I was provided care services by a NP at my primary care physician's office, not a specialist or an NP working from a specialists office or practice. 

I don't see any reason why I should be on the hook to pay 'specialist' co-pay for a routine visit to my GP. If any part of the visit or treatment during that visit was provided by a specialist, I expect that they would have charged me the proper co-pay amount at the office that day. Since they didn't and I was asked to pay the standard Dr. office visit co-pay, I believe this to be an error that is not mine  to shoulder.

Further, if this had really been a 'specialist' visit my insurance provider would not have covered the regular Dr.'s office co-pay or the specialist co-pay as I did not have a referral to see or be treated by a specialist per their requirement."

healthcare,"NPs have boards for specialties as well and can get board certified. They absolutely can be specialists and depending on where they are they don't even need a collaborative agreement with a MD/DO. "
healthcare,"Yes NPs can be specialists but if you went to your GPs practice then I do not believe you should've been billed as such. It usually just takes clarification from insurance. I just took my kid to the opthalmologist and was billed at the specialist rate but then just got a refund check in the mail because insurance said he was not a specialist according to my plan.  

Honestly your GP's office could've billed you the same as always and insurance made changes. Just give them a call. "
healthcare,"There's literally nothing in that bill that seems controversial or partisan at all, so it really just comes down to drug companies want to cheat the system to maintain their current profit share (and it IS cheating - none of the changes suggested are changes to the patent system or length of patents on drugs).

In short, drug execs just bought themselves out of trouble. Congratulations to them, I guess. The rest of us better start saving up for higher drug prices."

healthcare,"When you dig into it it's pretty difficult to offer discounted inpatient services. While simple outpatient services have begun to have a known price, hospital pricing is pretty much a black hole. It's hard to compete on price when you can't point out what your competitor's pricing actually is. 

In Boston, where I'm from, there were some really good community hospitals outside the city that were able to offer quality care at far lower prices than the top research hospitals like MGH. The big hospital networks however were allowed to buy up those smaller community hospitals and there's not a lot of competition left. Pretty pessimistic that hospital pricing will change much but hopefully we can continue shifting care outside the hospital where pricing is a bit more competitive."

The tried and truth path there, even for health policy, is something like a MPA...but honestly, I think economics or a JD is the currency of the realm. That said, even a B.A. an a strong interest is enough. If that's part of your passion, consider shadowing or even interning for a policy lead for a local health system. That person usually has a JD and not an MHA... soak up the the process stuff and policy stuff... then find a local candidate or someone in office and ask to help with health policy. You'll be surprised - even at the state level - a young eager person is often what they are looking for. 

You can also consider trying to start right within state or local government at something like a social security, Medicaid or support service office.

I ended up falling in love with the admin side, especially while working at a medium sized PT practice and helping start up their social media and CRM programs and improving practice flow with more established benchmarking. The only thing I was not a huge fan of for my program was a lack of a mandatory internship. Many of my classmates were already well-established doctors, nurses, or other healthcare workers so it didn't really matter for them, but for those coming in at an entry level I would definitely recommend a program with a mandatory internship. I did get my green belt in Lean Six Sigma, which was nice, but I would have enjoyed a mandatory internship more. I would recommend working at any healthcare practice you can while you pursue your masters, as any experience is good experience. I'm looking at pursuing an MPH and eventually a doctorate in the same thing. The only thing I would recommend is getting IT experience. Your program should have at least a class or two dedicated to it, but more experience in it is essential given the way things are going. "

These docs are the best thing since sliced bread. I'm surprised more people don't use them.

You typically pay 50 dollars EVERY month and get unlimited primary care. Long appointments, same day. Some give you 24 hour access to their cell phone. No insurance hurdles. Great care.

It's basically what going to the doc back in the day was like. Real honest, caring healthcare. 

For about 600 dollars a year, you get unlimited care. Some ACA insurances cost 600 a month!!"
healthcare,"The study comes out three months after Congress allowed funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program — which provides insurance to nine million low-income kids — to expire. And it builds on data released earlier this year, which finds that overall life expectancy in the United States has declined for the past two years — a troubling trend that hasn’t been seen since the 1960s.

Infants in the US have a 76 percent higher risk of death than in other wealthy nations. “It really seems to be the impact of our fragmented health care system,” Thakrar says. “Mothers who are qualifying for Medicaid for the first time because they’re mothers might be seeing doctors for the first time. They might not have a family physician, or a clear support system.”

Teenagers in the United States are 82 times more likely to die from gun homicide. And US teenagers are twice as likely to die in car accidents than their peers abroad.

Earlier this year, Congress failed to reauthorize spending for a home visitation program that serves low-income families and their children. Funding for Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting ran out the same day as CHIP, and there is no conversation about extending its budget."
healthcare,"Private healthcare is adversarial healthcare. Rational customers try to lower costs by not buying insurance until they need it. Rational providers will prevent them from doing that by limiting the windows during which they can sign up.

So if you went to the Ear you can contact the hospital and call B.S.. its a common ploy for the hospitals to claim out of state isn't covered to get you to pay. This was really designed to prevent Medicaid from getting screwed by out of state hospitals claiming they weren't contracted.  Even if it wasn't ER, most Medicaid recipients are ""held harmless "" which means you are not financially responsible for the bill. I'd suggest getting your carrier on the phone to let them know you received a bill for healthcare services and they need to work it out with the hospital.

I've worked with Medicaid health insurance in multiple states for over ten years."

So, docs keep jumping from clinic to clinic looking for a place that actually values their expertise. "

healthcare,"Well this answer is most likely not the complete answer.

You might be seeing a locum tenen, which is a doctor that is contracted out to cover the practice while they recruit another full time Physician.

I work in healthcare and we do hire locum tenens to bridge the gap of the loss of a Physician and hiring a new one. This happens more often in rural communities that struggle to attract physicians to the area, but does happen in more metropolitan areas as well.

You might also be seeing a rotation based practice. Some groups rotate physicians for coverage reasons as well. This is rare, but it happens.

Primary Care is in a severe shortage of physicians for some of the reasons above, but that is certainly not the entire answer. That being said, there is a shortage of physicians throughout the country and the trends are not improving. Fellowships across the country are not being filled and this is putting more and more stress on the system. Reform to healthcare would go a long way to bringing talented people back into the profession.

Hope this helps!"
healthcare,Doctors also used to own the practices and be small business owners.  Over the years it's become much more difficult to open and maintain a practice and now big companies and hospitals buy up/open many practices.  They often churn through docs because they just care about getting as many patients seen in the back shortest amount of time of possible
healthcare,"Lol @ the two previous answers. As for why doctors move, I've not seen that sort of movement personally in my 20 years of health care experience. Even my own doctor has only moved once in the 7 years I've gone to him. And that was to have his own practice and not be a part of a group.

Now all the sayings about obamacare and insurance payments are untrue. Granted we are moving towards quality of care vs fee for services for a few reasons. Some people took advantage of the system, and billed out for things at a higher rate or didn't happen. Plus you have people not taking care of themselves (being fatter, drinking more, drugs etc...) so that costs more in health care. I think people that don't take care of themselves should be charged a greater share for using more services, and not be able to drop coverage. But alas I doubt that will ever happen "

healthcare,"Ya it could be locum tenens (which means they are a part time temporary doctor). This is BECAUSE physicians are treated so horrible and quit. Locum tenens are brought in because the clinic cannot find a doctor to work there, or because there are not enough doctors and one needs to take a vacation.

Facts are. Docs work miserable tortuous hours. Most docs are now employees thanks to the high cost of running a clinic. Hospitals have gobbled up all of the ""town doctors"".

Insurance companies don't pay docs what they are worth. This means docs have to work MORE hours to make a living.

Physicians are the only real source of revenue for a clinic. Physician visits pay for the front office staff, the equipment, nurses, utilities, rent. As payments from insurance go down, physicians need to see more patients to make the same amount of money, this is why so many patients are crammed in to an 8 hour day. Then physicians get to go home and do the charting until 9pm.  Then on Saturdays, physicians get to .........,,,,,,,,,,,,wait for it.................,,DO MORE CHARTING!!!!!! More data entry! Hurray! Thank you Obamacare! Thanks big data!

So physicians get no home life. People think they make a lot, but that's a lie. They work twice as many hours. 

Medicaid and Medicare pay a FRACTION of what the already low insurance payments are. A fraction. This means more patients because of expanded Medicaid means less money. 

Don't get me wrong, all people deserve to be treated and to receive healthcare. But all physicians deserve to be paid the FULL AMOUNT for the service rendered. Imagine if you were told you would only be paid 70 % of your normal pay because the job had to do with Medicaid, and that your boss wants you to work a 16 hour day instead of 8 bit you get no overtime.

Now tell me how great physicians have it,

And for those that say, ""They are the highest paid job in the nation! My doc drives a Mercedes!""

Would you work 16 hour days for 8 hour pay? Would you take out 200,000 dollars plus in school loans? Would you work for peanuts for 3-8 years after you graduated just to get your license, while interest in your loans accrues? Would you do this with every Tom, Dick, and Harry trying to sue you! Would you do this when you have to spend thousands of dollars a year to keep your license? Would you do this knowing even when you take a vacation you may have to be on call? Would you do this when so many drug seeking patients assault you or threaten to kill you?

Quick answer: being a doctor sucks and they are all scrambling for a clinic that actually gives them a lifestyle where they can spend time with their family."
healthcare,"Lol. Wrong. Your doc is probably older. They prob are ready to retire. And they probably had doctor parents who paid for all of their college AND who practiced medicine when doctors WERE rich! Plus, they probably inherited all of that wealth!

I understand how you perceive the industry to be. Maybe you're a doctor who was given the golden spoon. Or maybe you're a foreigner who practices here because you got free college. 

Talk to physicians and I think you'll get a different answer. Read articles on KevinMD and learn what docs go through.

Physicians have the highest suicide rates of any profession. As many as an entire medical school kill themselves every year. More then 50% of all docs would NOT recommend healthcare for their own children. Burnout rates for docs are huge.

Fee for quality = make docs do ungodly hours of data entry so they can have the data to use and sell to different organisations. It also equals lawyers being able to prove a doc screwed up so they can sue them.

If we are focused on quality, why do studies show that physicians spend 2/3 of patient time entering fats and 1/3 talking to patient? Insurance companies give a doc 15 minutes. That means a doc should only talk to you for 5 minutes. QUALITY??????

You took the red pill."
healthcare,"Do you work in healthcare? Do you know how any of this works??

Physicians have a thankless job, like many of those who choose a profession of service and caregiving. Please do not speak for all of those that have given their lives and careers to the profession.

I have had the opportunity to work for and with some amazing physicians and caregivers and can tell you that despite the constant changes and increasing expectations, they still love caring for people and helping people improve their health and wellbeing.

Quality measures are put into place so that you know what type of facility and provider will be caring for you. Quality measures help people live longer healthier lives.

Yes, those measures take extra time to enter into the computer system, but these are measures that haven't been collected in ""the good old days"" when physicians couldn't compile data at a macro level to help eliminate disease and illness. Quality measures help us cure complex disease like cancer.

If you prefer to move to a country that doesn't measure quality data and doesn't work towards curing diseases and doesn't care about improving the health of everyone in the country, then you will have to find somewhere else to live. This is the reality of medicine. Embrace your increasing longevity and start saving your pennies for your retirement... It's going to be a long one!"

Your ideas are not well formed nor are they presented well. 

Also my doctor is in his late 40s so I don't believe he is retiring anytime soon. "
healthcare,"I agree physicians care about their patients.

Sit down and talk to your colleagues about whether they think constantly entering all of this data into the ehr is a benefit to their job. And no, this data is not curing cancer. If it did, other countries that supposedly do this would have a cure for cancer.

Seriously, talk to a physician and ask them if most of this data is not a waste of their time. Data is fine, but the govt and insurance is not paying physicians to enter this data. Physicians are forced to do it for free. If this were such a great thing, why would there be a 90,000 physician shortage? We have a shortage because being a doctor SUCKS!!!!!!

Patients suffer because they only get a few minutes of time with their doctor.

It will likely result in qualified people being removed from coverage by ""mistakes"" and have to apply again.  Making it as difficult as possible for people to get medical coverage is part of their plan.  They would rather spend more money making it harder for people to enroll than spend less and cover a few people who could get a job.  It's something they can brag about and some of their base will like, even though it just shifts spending from care costs to administrative costs.  Such a waste."
healthcare,"I work in this field. There is no direct correlation between how wealthy a physician’s clientele is and their determined rates in the underwriting process. Rates are determined by state (often broken down by county), specialty, limits, loss history, among some other factors. 

Certain states and counties within those states have higher rates due to state law and the litigious nature of those areas. Areas with higher litigation rates might have wealthier inhabitants, but again, not a direct tie. 

Certain high risk specialties have higher rates, for a multitude of reasons. OB/GYNs for example have very high rates. This is because the statutes of limitations for any issues can often last until even after the child’s 18th birthday, among other reasons. 

State specific laws exist for what limits of insurance physicians must purchase. Physicians rarely purchase and insurance carriers rarely provide limits any higher than the state determined level. Unless gross negligence is involved, physicians will usually not be sued for anything above their limits of insurance, no matter how wealthy the patient may be. 

Loss history is how many times a given doctor has been sued in the past and for how much. Obviously a huge factor when determining rates. 

Other insurances would come into play here if the malpractice were to result in the person not being able to work. Ex. Disability insurance, Life insurance, etc. Long winded response, but happy to pass on the information."
healthcare,"Thanks. So is it you understanding that malpractice payouts are rarely based on earnings potential? That surprises me, I thought it would be the majority of cases. If something goes bad enough that they are suing, I would have thought in many cases that it disrupts their ability to work."
healthcare,"Payouts are usually based on the severity of the malpractice. Depending on the situation, the person’s disability insurance would kick in to make up for the lost income. "

healthcare,"Interesting article kinda related, but not sure how it works if you don't have any insurance.  Would be nice if we could get to a single payer system where everyone is covered rather than the bs that is the current system which you are experiencing first hand, unfortunately.

healthcare,"**This is the only tip you will ever need to rid yourself of flu:

If you want to cure influenza all you need is this:

- Lugol’s 5% iodine solution (Speak to pharmacist in Canada to acquire, otherwise purchase online)

- a dropper

Directions when fighting flu:

Day 1: 4 doses of 20 vertical drops of iodine in water spread out throughout the day.
Day 2: 4 doses of 10 drops of iodine in water spread throughout the day.

** vertical drops refer to holding dropper vertically

You can continue with Day 2 dosage for 3 days (including day 2) if you want to be sure, in my case it was always gone after first day.

Flu will be gone after first day, second day is just to make sure.  It will not cure secondary infections like sinus infection etc but it will irradicate the flu virus from your system and you will feel way better after just one day.

I have used this twice and it irradicated my flu both times, one day unable to get off couch, following day energy back and feeling wayyyy better.  I took this protocol from a doctor who used it to cure influenza and malaria in Africa.  Good Luck!﻿"
healthcare,"Scum. "
healthcare,"How about we allow anyone to enroll into medicaid and medicare at cost? No preexisting conditions, the poor would still be covered? This would give a guaranteed low cost solution to anyone who needed or wanted it. It would lower medicaid and medicare costs through higher enrollment. This idea is not new, take the example of United States Postal Service (USPS). No one can deliver a letter for $.50 except for the USPS. So some who still are not happy go to UPS or Fedex. The fact is the USPS is fair competition and keeps prices low. Hence why even Amazon uses the USPS. Lets make insurance as accessible, affordable and dependable as the Post Office or at least use medicaid and medicare to disrupt the market and keep costs down through fair competition."

healthcare,"Like with so many health care things in our country,it's all about money money money here. When my wife got sick while at the gyno for a pregnancy check-up, they called an ambulance, which then just drove her literally across the street to the hospital. We said we can just drive her but they insisted. 
That 30 second trip cost us almost $1000 dollars. Insurance didn't pay anything. 
I heard a lot of stories like this and it's just not acceptable. "
