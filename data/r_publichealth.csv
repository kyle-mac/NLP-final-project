publichealth,And are you planning on working back home or working in the US?
publichealth,"I find that getting posts removed or engaging in debate with a conspiracy theorist does nothing to change behaviors. Instead, I will just comment with something like ""Interesting theory, but it seems like most experts have a different opinion: &lt;link to some easy to read correct source debunking the topic&gt;. The goal is to provide an alternate and correct source where people can go to find the information"
publichealth,What alternatives would you suggest for people interested in epi?
publichealth,"MPH student here with a non-traditional undergraduate degree (BS Environmental Science).

Pick a couple of schools where you think you'd like to get an MPH and look at their curricula, then be sure to fill in any holes you have while you're still in your undergraduate program. Economics would be good but I'm betting you'll have to take that for your degree. Load up on Statistics and Probability—the more the better. A Sociology class might be useful. If you can build on Statistics and take a Data Analysis class, you'll be ahead of the game."
publichealth,"I have not worked inside CDC, but have worked closely with them for years. First worked with DHAP dealing with domestic HIV as a state-level epidemiologist. I was accepted into EIS and declined. After my PhD I was the Country Director for a CDC-funded NGO in an Ebola-affected country during the 2014-2016 epidemic. CDC temporary duty (TDY) staff would work with our organization as they rotate in and out, while we managed the long-term health systems strengthening."
publichealth,"This one is tough. I went to the cheapest CEPH accredited, but I also didn't apply to any of the top programs (despite one being in state and close). Even though I didn't go to a top program, I had a fantastic MPH experience, learned a lot, and got into another school for PhD. 

However, I will say I was in an established CEPH program for my MPH that was well organized. If the newer one your talking about isn't CEPH accredited and doesn't have at least 2-3 cohorts out, I don't know that I'd pick it. The more established program is most likely going to get you to your next career step better than a less-established program. 
"
publichealth,Thanks for replying! Did you do your MBA as an online program?
publichealth,"Yes, my AmeriCorps duties included teaching fitness and nutrition to school aged children (very public health-y).  Most AmeriCorps positions should have a public health or social health component (all related- all good on a resume).  Just a note, I didn't like my AmeriCorps job, but it was really good experience. 

So I did 1 year AmeriCorps and then worked 2 years for a local public health department.  I highly recommend working before MPH, if possible.  

3 big reasons: 
1) you can contribute meaningful discussion in your courses, it was very obvious to me who in my classes had a sense of PH work and who didn't.  
2) if you're working in PH you should have a wealth of knowledge at your fingertips that will help you complete classes, for instance I don't know anything about water testing but it was in one of my classes, so I walked down to environmental health and asked someone to explain the process 
3) PH is sort of a risky field to be in, most PH jobs rely on grant funding and the political climate, a lot of jobs are limited term or on contract. Try to avoid incurring as much debt as possible.  AmeriCorps provides you with an educational stipend. My 1 year covered 1 semester of grad school. I saved money like crazy while working full time. I had a cheap living situation and I ate a lot of peanut butter banana sandwiches. I was able to pay for grad school out of pocket. 

My program allowed you to take 1 class at a time, I doubled up the last semester to finish a little early.  That last semester was tough, but otherwise I had no prob completing the coursework while continuing to work full time. "
publichealth,"I think you're touching on a wider issue there as well, which is just like many other sectors of government spending, like the military, without consistent funding you only understand the impact of something because of its absence. Things don't become crises if you take preventative measures, and though everyone understands that its more expensive to fix a crisis, there's not the political will to put public health on the same level of concern as defense spending. Instead, we get what we got when we had when returning health workers who volunteered to help with the Ebola crisis, with politicians using what they've seen in movies as a means of controlling something they don't have the qualifications to understand in the first place. It's all show, no substance, which unfortunately is what the public health departments in many places have become, just marketing departments that just run PSA's on television, which lets face it is a dwindling medium like newspapers."
publichealth,"It's definitely a gamble. But I think it'll help if you have an intended date of moving and housing secured. If you didn't find a job right away is your SO ok with handling expenses? I would say that's another important consideration. 

Also, keep in mind any alumni associations for your college and other networking opportunities. Does your school have an alumni association in ATL? Try to make the most of this when you move to a new destination. If nothing pans out, I will be hitting these up! Networking is so key these days. "
publichealth,"Television? Lol lol I wish we had the budget for that. I agree with the majority of your post, I would like to add one item - years and years of not being able to tell the people you want to reach a damn thing is incredibly fatiguing. After a while you just stick to what you’re funded for and roll with it - opioid awareness? Sounds great! Built environment? Sure, let’s buy some outdoor exercise equipment! I would love for wic to have higher participation rates, but after a while it just gets tiring trying to share what a great and useful program it is, all for another report of declining numbers."
publichealth,"It depends on the university but more importantly, the concentration you do. Unless you go into consulting "
publichealth,"Woooo my alma mater making news! "
publichealth,"I agree. And the UK is cool, good Healthcare and personally I would rather work and like in the UK."
publichealth,Emergency Planner for my county. Still here!
publichealth,It’s bleak. I applied for probably over 200 jobs (every public health job I could find) and only got a couple interviews. I couldn’t find a job in my field so now I’m using my skills with data analysis and big data at a healthcare business instead. Thinking about going back to school for a PhD or becoming an actuary now. There’s just not enough public investment in public health.
publichealth,"Definitely project management skills for one. There's a lot of juggling multiple programs at the same time, coordinating people and resources, and you need a mindset that can explore different outcomes for different situations. 

One moment you might be determining how many victims a hospital can take in during a mass casualty incident and the next you're finding 4 more hospitals to send patients to because the assailant turned up to the first hospital and now their staff and patients are victims too.

A month later and you're evacuating 100,000 people for a hurrucane with only enough shelter space for 30,000, and only enough staff for half of those shelters to be open. There's always something to keep it interesting."
publichealth,They do offer opportunities for that in both! Thank you :)
publichealth,"Thank you! "
publichealth,"Hey /u/Health_inspector7 thanks so much for your feedback! I have taken a couple courses in Epi and will look into taking a toxicology course. I assume most of the paperwork you're doing related to reporting the issues/non-issues you document on an inspection? 
Do you get involved in any of the follow-up to the neighbor that can't pay to fix the issue? Court cases, etc? 
Thanks again! I so appreciate professionals taking the time to give great feedback to students. "
publichealth,"(I finished my B.S. a year ago and deferred my acceptance to get my Masters in Public Health for a year to travel around Europe and teach English in Spain... 10/10 RECOMMEND. I had an incredible experience and feel ready and refreshed to continue my studies in graduate school).

Do it now, before you start your masters. especially since it's a career switch, you don't know if it's REALLY what you want so traveling (especially solo) will give you a refresh / time to think about your life / experience the world and all your options wholeheartedly (not that you're not doing that already, but it'll for sure help add perspective. also you said you've been working already for 4 years so this is as good of time as any: you're debt free, you have savings, and once you get your masters you'll start working again and your career may just keep going and going and you'll never get the break you want. I say, if you have the means and time in your schedule/life to do it, then DO IT! :)

TL;DR: traveling if you have time/the means to &gt;&gt;&gt; burning yourself out with more work/school too soon"
publichealth,"Is this your first computing language? And do you already have a background in stats?

I didn't learn stats till grad school, but I had some experience coding, so the learning curve wasn't so terrible. Hard, but not completely alien.

Enterprise Guide took me a while to understand but it's pretty good if you need to do a lot of processes. In staying to appreciate its quirks. Still wish I were on regular SAS though because now I'm finding old programs to be Enterprise compatible, and I sort of hate it."
publichealth,"Yes I'm far from ATL. I live in upstate NY. (I was actually down in ATL last weekend though and it was a LONG drive!). I may ask my SO to do that, except I'm afraid of dealing with legal issues. Who knows, they may find out when doing background checks and may lead to trouble). "
publichealth,"I was much more selective but also much more careful about my applications. I only applied to jobs I actually wanted and I believed I was very qualified for, and I customized my resume and cover letter for every application. I made sure my references were solid, I also had writing samples prepared for interviews if it was relevant to the job. 

All together, I probably applied to 10 positions between March and June (graduation was May). Got 4 interviews and 2 offers. I started my job that July. 

I wouldn't recommend the method of applying to 80 positions with a standard resume and cover letter. Make yourself stand out. As another poster mentioned, it's all about your *experience* and not just your degree, and it's about how you sell that experience. "
publichealth,"It would first be helpful to know what you mean by ""pure IH"".  If you mean 100% of time spent chemical sampling then that is rare. I consider myself fairly pure IH and spend about 75% of my time doing task that are listed by ABIH as counting for IH CM points (chemical monitoring, noise monitoring, confined spaces, IAQ, PSM, and thermal stress) the other 25% is spent in safety committees, conducting general safety audits of areas with the largest amount of IH issues, and review of construction plans for EHS compliance. 

I think the number of jobs that are at least 75% IH are the same as they have been for years its that the number of total EHS professionals has grown so IH jobs are a smaller percentage of those available.  I think this is especially true for entry level positions. Though many of these entry positions may spend 50% time doing IH."
publichealth,"You have to complete 120 hours, (I think, it's been a year). I was able to secure an internship with someone I had met through my work. I had saved up a bunch of vacation time, but I only ended up using a few hours, otherwise I did the research and prepared the information from home.  Originally I was going to intern with someone who works in a hospital setting, but the hospital and UNE were being possessive about their paperwork, one wouldn't cede to the other, and I had to find something else in a matter of days in order to remain enrolled.  That was my hiccup.  At the end of the class that accompanies the internship you present a research paper.  Since my internship was slightly related to the work I was already doing, I chose to write my research paper on a completely different topic that I wanted to learn more about, but was really passionate about. It seems like extra work since most people made their paper off their internship, but I was deeply interested in this topic so it didn't feel like work.  Oh and you present a presentation based on your paper,  online like skype-ish style. "

2. What are things or skills you think people in your position should know or learn, especially going into the future?

3. How do you intend to deal with worker shortages, given the projections for public health workers?

publichealth,"I'm in a similar situation regarding relocation to Atlanta and looking for public health coordinator jobs. I've been told that it gets easier when you actually are physically present. I only started getting bites on my resume this past week after I secured an apartment and started publishing that on my resume/applications. It isn't falsifying anything, IMO, since that is physically where I will be. Just in three weeks' time. ;-)

Have you secured housing? Are you set on moving to Atlanta? It sounds like you have some solid padding for your resume, with the MPH recently earned and already being employed as a research assistant. Make sure to express your desire to relocate in your cover letters and, if possible, present a time frame. Google some phrasing to use. Often times employers are either seeking to hire in immediately or drag their feet for months on end (this is what I'm discovering with a few positions and I just can't wait that long).

Try looking at Indeed and keep hunting around Emory's site for the coordinator positions. "
publichealth,"I might be able to- it's really good to know that program accreditation is that important though! I may do an MSc instead to minimize chances of time wasting. "
publichealth,"I suppose every program starts somewhere and they're obviously compensating you well for the risk.  Is your alma mater competent otherwise?  I'd imagine that a large public school (or comfortably funded private) should have the resources to obtain accreditation and that could be worth your time. 

That said, the first cohort through can be a real pain in the ass if they haven't figured out (or staffed) their process.  I could imagine a few scenarios that concern me more than accreditation (if it's forthcoming):  

* Course availability:  Which classes will even be available while you're there?  You'll want to ask upfront about which ones are on the books to be offered the first year.  Are you going to be held over a semester waiting for courses to become available?  Are you going to miss out on survival analysis or cancer epidemiology or something that you intently want to study because it's never offered?

* Course development: What if your whole schedule was filled with courses that had never been taught before, no tested lesson plan or veteran lecturers?  What if instructors are just filling in on a course until the department hires new personnel?  Could be a real hit or miss situation.
   
* Advising: What if you have questions about fieldwork or about subbing courses or overrides?  Is there going to be someone qualified to give you guidance/permission if you're the first person with that issue?  Even accredited programs can put you a bad spot if they have a heavy staff turnover or poor organization that can't address exceptions to the rule. 

Don't get me wrong, I think free is great and if you aren't looking for employment that would require express accreditation (or are reasonably assured that accreditation is pending) then as long as the department is run well, it could be a good opportunity.  Good schools will bend over backwards to meet accreditation and in doing so they get heavily invested in your success.  It's a black mark for them if you don't graduate in the allotted time.  You'll have a lot of agency to provide feedback and shape the curriculum, maybe taking independent studies or getting guest lecturers, and they might be more inclined to take your input forward each semester to improve.

BUT you are going to be a test case, an absolutely free test case.  "

publichealth,"If you want to spend most of your career in the USA, you will be best served by getting a degree from a school in the USA. A British school will focus on public health in the British context. For example, all the time you spend learning about the NHS will be pointless, and you'll be at a disadvantage to your American peers who have learned more than you about the ACA and county health departments. "
publichealth,"Hi OP.  I've an MPH in Biostats.  

I'd recommend trying to learn the stats packages your program uses ahead of time.  Find a short course online.  SAS offers some intro stuff for free (it's not intuitive); there are a ton of free R resources available online.  You can get both of these programs for free.  Stats classes are generally taught in tandem with a statistical programming package and, having some orientation to coding, you can focus on the methods being taught rather than troubleshooting your code all week for simple errors.  It can carry you forward through a lot of tough classes when you don't have to spend as much time learning the programming component (which is probably less complicated to learn on your own than the statistical concept).  Just grind through some instructionals now and learn the nuances that you would rather not first learn of the night before an assignment is due.

There, let your present self do your future self a favor."
publichealth,"Public health outreach coordinator for TennCare Kids. Now a County Director.

publichealth,"Undergrad in Safety Management and worked in aluminum and oil refinery industries. Worked on the private sector for 2 years, but realized that private safety didn’t thrill me anymore. 

Chose to pursue a Masters in Public Health. Now work at a local public health department ensuring food and cannabis safety. I’d do it all over again without hesitation. Taking a couple of years between education made me realize loving what you do should be your priority. "
publichealth,"I was confused about MHA as well, but I decided to go with MBA in healthcare administration because it’s well known worldwide and gives you the business acumen needed for hospital management, imo. 

"
publichealth,"You'll be fine. I actually found my MPH easier than my undergraduate degree. In my experience, professors are more clear about what they want you to learn and there are a ton of group projects \(which have a lot of practical applications in the work world\)."
publichealth,"I second this, start in a rural area to get the whole picture OP! Food is exhausting after a while if it’s the only thing you do"
publichealth,What are you trying to do after you finish your post graduate degree? Like what line of work are you considering?
publichealth,"Ahh...gotcha.  Well, I wouldn't pass up a fully funded MSc program for the chance to attend an MPH that may or may not be accredited.  I think it's rare that a program applies for accreditation and doesn't receive it, but if you have to make a decision before June when they find out for sure, I wouldn't risk it."
publichealth,"I'm not sure what your future plans are in clinical research. MPH gives you more career flexibility outside of clinical research whereas MSc in Clinical Research will probably make you easier for hiring straight out of grad school with clinical research organizations. I'm more on the staff and running trials side rather than principal investigator aspirations. Work experience is valued more on my side.   "
publichealth,"Not sure if something informal like this would meet your needs, but if you just want some practice without having to pay for an additional credential [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?languages=en&amp;query=biostatistics) has some really good free/very cheap MOOCs that focus on biostatistics for public health.

I went to a ceph-accredited state school as well."
publichealth,I would never encourage anyone to be an MPH right now and I am a former faculty member for a school of public health. I regularly get emails from old students who have been out of work for a year. It’s a mess.
publichealth,"I’m in a somewhat similar position so I don’t have much advice to offer. I was just curious, what city are you looking for employment in? Also the internship you’ve been offered sounds like an amazing opportunity. Is it a paid opportunity limited to recent grads or is it open to current students as well? "

publichealth,Me too! I'm graduating very soon from UNE \&lt;3
publichealth,"Do not spend more money than you have to on a MPH.

The only field that comes close to a guarantee of a very high ROI is Biostats. Epi, Policy, and some segments of Environmental Health can have decent returns, but there's a greater range of salaries in those fields and that comes with much lower salaries to pay debts back.

$60-120k on a MPH is beyond ridiculous. You're wanting to indulge your dream of living in Europe, and I think you know it. Don't do it.

Have you considered the Peace Corps? That seems like a better way to get your foot in the door and will likely give you a leg up into more competitive global health programs."
publichealth,"Hmmmm. Do you think an MSc in clinical research would be just as useful as an MPH? Most of my mentors/senior coworkers have an MPH so I wasn't sure if I'd be selling myself short or at a disadvantage with an MSc instead of an MPH.  "
publichealth,"You post here quite a bit warning others not to get into public health. The majority of people in the field do fine, and most don't go into it for the money. Would you care to give details on your situation?"

publichealth,"I'm an infectious disease epi in Ontario. Unfortunately, the MPH/MSc is the absolute minimum for most entry level positions in public health. At the moment, there is a real over-saturation of MPHs in the hunt for any available vacancy to the point where even most of our health/data analysts ('junior' epis) and research assistants all have MPHs and are putting in their time and trying to very slowly work their way up the ladder. So the bottom line is - it's hard enough to get a job in infectious disease epi for someone with an MPH...let alone for someone with ""only"" a BSc. 

My advice would be to go for the MPH sooner than later. Although you would be a more competitive applicant if you had some relevant public health experience, it is highly, highly unlikely that you will be able to find opportunities in infectious disease epidemiology without a masters."

publichealth,Please share if possible :\) Very proud of my med student friends
publichealth,"Yeah... I am too. You'll be fine with an MPH, it'll just be harder than other industries. There are government jobs (working with the community) and research assistant jobs at academic institutions. Try to rake up as little debt as possible. Seriously, I cannot stress that enough. And make sure you get a student job that gives you experience in public health while you are in school. Otherwise you'll have nothing relevant to attach to your resume.

I got my MPH in health education and behavioral sciences. I have ended up doing stakeholder engagement at a medical school, and am not using the knowledge I gained about behavioral change models and health promotion. This being said, I do like my job a lot (it is challenging, but not so exhausting that I don't have energy to do other things when I get home from work)."
publichealth,"Also, the Student Doctor Network has a great yearly MPH applicants forum where you can see people's stats, acceptances, and scholarships to gauge yourself. 

If you have a few hours (or days, tbh) you should consider looking there as a potential applicant! "
publichealth,"Yes, and it’s important if you pursue something beyond your MS, so I’d look into the MSc option or ask the other university what additional resources they will be providing students if they cannot get accreditation by the mid June deadline. They can’t fault you for having reservations, especially since accreditation is very important in the field. "

publichealth,"Scholarships are difficult in any graduate program. Student funding in the order of prevalence and amount provided are:

1. School provided merit scholarship programs given at the time of enrollment, most common for biostatistics
1. Funding attained from working as a research assistant/program manager
1. Workplace provided continued education incentives
1. School-specific named scholarships
1. Government sponsored loan forgiveness or scholarship programs, including Armed Services, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, sometimes Peace Corps, etc
1. Institutional Scholarships from Gates, Rotary, Global Fund, etc., often tied to specific concentration areas
1. Institutional Scholarships focused on diversity grants 

As to where to find these, your school student services and peers are the best place to start. Look at the major funder organizations in your area of concentration to see if they run scholarship programs. "
publichealth,"You should look into mph/mba dual degrees. Hopkins has one but you need 2 years of work experience to apply.  

This might be the brutal truth but I wouldn’t advise you to do any of these. If you are admitting at this point in the process that you don’t know about what you applied to, that’s a problem. You should work for a few years and think about where you want to end up. Keep learning about the field and only until you have short term and long term goals, then go back to school. Remember that mph or mba programs aren’t like med school or law school where you get your license and work in that profession. They are open ended and having 2-4 years of work experience before doing your masters makes a huge difference in terms of getting good, fulfilling jobs when you graduate "
publichealth,"Hey, I'm an EHS, REHS. There is no set day to day type of work, it varies with the season and can flucuate dramatically. One day I may have almost nothing to do, the next I may have a few hundred miles to go with a lot of on site work to do, the next I may spend three hours in a single restaurant, and of course those very painful days spent doing nothing but paperwork.

The worst part for me is enforcement. It sucks to get into a situation where someone's poo is flowing on to the neighbors lawn and of course without fail the culprit has no money to fix the issue. It also sucks writing up a restaurant for something that you know the landowner will never fix.

If you are really looking at this I would highly suggest you look at working in a rural area. I personally would never do this job if I was stuck in a city only inspecting food establishments. Where I work I get to work with food, sewage, water, daycares, pools, recreational waters and HAB, vectors, as well as the plethora of other totally random stuff along with all the complaints I get. 

I would highly suggest you take some courses on epidimiology and toxicology if you haven't already.

Gory details??? I have investigated multiple residence for public nuisance determinations, generally for odor. The worst so far was a place someone kept a dog in, they litteraly only kept this dog in the house and noeone lived there. Every month or so they would toss in a bag of food and fill up some water dishes. This went on for years. Needless to say there was several inches of poop on the floor, mosquito infested pails full of water, feet thick layers of spiderwebs, mold everywhere, and an unholy stench. As a caveat to the hating enforcement point, in these situations I have no problem with it.

If you are planning to stay at your hospital, see if they are stupid.  What I mean by stupid.....will they pay you for years of experience working for them, or will they pay you as a zero xp nurse when you get hired.  I was very pissed that all the hospitals in my area didn't give a damn when I graduated with my RN, that I had 2 masters degrees and 20 years work experience...I got paid the same as a 21 year old who's only work experience was working at hooters.  When you get that RN many places will only pay you as years of RN experience...which is stupid.


That being said.  

1.  Yes, most places won't take you seriously unless you have a few years RN experience under your belt.  Going to RN school doesn't teach you squat except how to pass the NCLEX.  You don't know diddly until you work the floor for a while.

2.  RN opened doors for me that my MPH couldn't get me prior...I basically had a 'hollow' MPH meaning, no experience.  

3.  I've gotten myself into research now, and love it.  My MPH is helping to get me into some roles that I would have had to spend years grinding for.  

RN is never a bad thing, but the way the system is set up, you're going to be frustrated for a few years.  (Unless you're lucky)"

publichealth,Some schools offer programs for individuals who have established their career/gotten other degrees but want to get an MHA.  The one at the school I attended was majority online but had a week each semester on campus. That might be something to look into to give you the best of both worlds.
publichealth,"I was a case manager for people with disabilities, and absolutely hated it. The work itself was fine, but the management was unbearable. Now I’m a clinical research coordinator/ophthalmic technician and I’m enjoying this a bit more, but I plan on applying to graduate programs in epidemiology."
publichealth,"I applied with a few years of biomedical research and only a small PH internship in college (through a class, so not even individual), yet I was accepted to every program I applied and most with scholarships.

Apply!! "
publichealth,"I work in clinical research and I've never been asked whether my MPH is from a CEPH program (which it is). I don't plan on going for a PhD and I don't forsee myself in governmental public health which is where I see more of the CEPH requirement. A full ride at the graduate level is a hard one to turn down. 

Just keep in mind, regardless of funding, whenever an institution is starting a new program and you're in one of the first cohorts, there will inevitably be growing pains and you'll be a part of the figuring out whether the curriculum plan works. "
publichealth,"started out as a undergraduate research assistant in public health nutrition and health educator on my college campus

worked as a clinical study coordinator for 2 years and then went back for my MPH in Health Behavior and Health Education. During my MPH, I worked in evaluation and research

post\-MPH I worked as a Outreach/Client Services Manager for a software start up, research associate in clinical trials research, and now project coordinator for a PCORI funded project at a large university/health system"
publichealth,I guess practicality depends on your long-term goals. I'm glad that you found a concentration that was much more aligned with your interests!
publichealth,"Having worked in the public sector (not public health) for 12 years, here's what I've consistently observed: budgets are first allocated to what is most politically expedient for the people in charge, followed by whatever is a ""hot"", consistently trending topic among *voters*. 

Because of that, allocating budget to healthcare and public health is often reactionary to a large event. It's rarely proactive. 

A cynical lesson I've learned is that the people in charge are voted in or appointed by those who are voted in.  And their ultimate goal above all else is to be re-elected. How do they do that? By appeasing their constituent *voters* and those who bolster their (re)election efforts. 

This lack of spending on public health will remain a problem until a large enough group of voters makes it their priority and voices it to their elected leaders. "
publichealth,Does the woman actually *use* her MPH at her airline company job? I ask because I could easily see an MPH grad ending up in a public-health-related project management role and then getting another job in project management outside of public health to make more $$.
publichealth,I'm going part-time and it is definitely the way to go if you can swing it. It's much more manageable.
publichealth,"Started as a health educator at a county health department as my first job after undergrad. Currently working in epidemiology at a different county health department and just finished my MPH online. "
publichealth,"My reports are technical reports, a write\-up of the sampling I've done and the conclusions and recommendations based on the results, and they're very much structured like a high school or college lab report. My company very much strives to keep our reports readable to the layperson, so we get technical in order to cover all the information they need, but we don't get too into the weeds of how something works.

My day to day relies mostly on chemistry \(analytical and organic\), but I had a microbiology undergraduate degree, so colleagues will come to me with biology questions as well. I also occasionally have to get into physics, specifically regarding noise, ventilation \(fluid dynamics\) and ionizing radiation, but I've had to apply non\-ionizing radiation and simple mechanics as well.

My first job was in the Risk Management department at a university, but I moved to consulting after I got my master's degree. I much prefer consulting, though Risk Management did still give me a variety in my day to day.

Also, some books to read: The Jungle by Upton Sinclair and Radium Girls by Kate Moore are both great. If you can find it, Pain and Prejudice by Karen Messing is one I like to recommend to researchers and scientists because while the author studies ergonomics, the book is also about remembering that her research subjects are people."
publichealth,"Thanks for your response. Was yours and executive type of MHA? 
Do you mind me asking which school?"
publichealth,"If your program has a practicum and capstone requirement then start looking for one in the field where you want to work at the very beginning. When you meet your advisor they should ask about your interests but if they don't then you should ensure that they know what sort of work you want to do for those two requirements. If it's a program that requires a thesis, start looking for data on day one. If you delay then you might find yourself taking whatever project is available and perhaps not loving it as much. "
publichealth,"Okay why don't you revisit this after you are in your last semester of MPH. "
publichealth,Great questions. Thank you!
publichealth,"I’m a RN, MPH working in maternal and child health. If you want to advance in hospital admin/management, a nursing degree would definitely be helpful. You will likely have to work as a staff RN for a couple years to gain experience before moving into management — the value a clinical degree brings to your career comes with the clinical experience, so working as a RN is crucial if you want the RN to advance your career. 

It really depends on what you hope to do in the future. If you want to be more on the data analysis/research/epi side, a RN might not make a huge difference to job prospects. If you want to do case management/department management/clinical side of hospital admin/quality improvement, then a RN would be very helpful."
publichealth,"From what I understand, it really depends on the school! Emory, Columbia, etc tend to have very large \(100\+\) classes for cores, whereas others \(Vanderbilt, etc\) are often less than 40"
publichealth," As someone with a BA and a MPH, I'm not sure how those two things are the same ""level"". I went to graduate school to learn so much more and to have higher earning potential. I'm on soft money and looking for my next position. 

When I read something like this, I read, ""we want someone with master's-level knowledge and abilities but we're only going to pay at a bachelor's level."" I'm pretty disappointed that what seems to be the general consensus of employers now is: ""great that you went to grad school! Too bad you didn't get your PhD because, now, we're going to treat you like grad school only counts if you get a terminal degree! Hahaha!!!"""

publichealth,"Not sure about peace Corp but I’m looking at AmericaCorps right now and it looks intriguing "
publichealth,"Well depends what your goals are.. if you want a job more focused in data analysis/stats, then I would say take more biostats courses. You want to show employers that you have the proper training. There are a few grad certificate programs that will show that. Employers want to make sure you have the foundational knowledge before hiring a recent grad
"
publichealth,Would you mind PMing me some details about what your did for undergrad/when applying? I haven’t applied to MPH programs yet but I’m planning on attending an international master’s in the UK this fall related to global disease and your undergrad path seems similar to mine!
publichealth,"I had never thought of this before. Thank you for mentioning it. I will definitely look into it! "
publichealth,"MPH is pretty much the minimum needed for most public health jobs; where I am, individuals with bachelor's in public health degrees have a hard time getting hired. I think all but 2 of my MPH community health cohort found public health related jobs within 6 months of graduation (2 years ago). 

The most frustrating thing I run into is people running health promotion programs without health promotion degrees. I know a lot of MA/MS grads in health promotion jobs, with very little understanding of behavior change theory and health program theory, and it makes me wonder similarly. I don't know if they are just more appealing candidates than MPH grads, but it's very frustrating from a program evaluation standpoint. 

Edit: I know nurses in research who do pretty awesome work because of their experiences. I think there is more out there for a qualified clinical mind to assist in intervention delivery and measurement for research. "
publichealth,"All of this. I have a non-traditional bachelor's degree and an MPH. This combo has let me bring forward added value to a team. Public health, by definition, is multidisciplinary. And a willingness to work in rural areas to pay your dues and build field experience for even a few years will boost you forward for the rest of your career."
publichealth,What are the two schools?
publichealth,"The only tip I have for preparing (aka something to work on before classes start) is trying to find employment in your department. Most students will wait until after classes start or just before so you'll be ahead of the game and now that the spring semester is over and professors have turned in grades, it's no longer too early to ask about fall opportunities. Consider looking at TA opportunities in Geography and Envr as well if you can't find something in your department. I was a biology TA for my entire MPH because public health has very few undergrads and wanted PhD students to TA MPH courses, but bio had way more undergrads than they could handle and were sucking up TAs from every related department across the university (I was in nutrition and minored in bio and chem in undergrad)."
publichealth,"Could you elaborate on what you talk about with co-sleeping? Is it the risk of the infant being suffocated while the parents are sleeping?
"
publichealth,"Go for the MD! I just went to a panel on health disparities research, and all of the panelists except for one were physicians. You can do sooo much with the MD degree, and depending on your institution, can totally maintain a clinic and research. Also you’d have the option of doing a distance MPH for those with MDs, if you felt like you needed more quantitative skills. "
publichealth,How did you transition to epidemiology without a masters (and where did you do your masters online)? Do you have any advice?
publichealth,"Public health is forgiving to low GPAs and test scores. None of the content in an MPH is particularily difficult, the rigor comes from the speed in which you must learn it (in one year programs), and new concepts of epidemiology and biostatistics which can be confusing.

Schools are not looking for the top students, they are looking for students who will work in their schools priority areas. Local state school train students to fill their county health departments, sanitation offices, STD clinics, and hospitals. Even top-tier schools admit international students with poor grades but will go back to their countries and improve the health systems (and hopefully throw some grant money at their alma mater). Your mission statement matters a great deal.

An MPH hopeful with low GPA or test-scores can balance their application with a strong personal statement and experience in public service, public health, or research. At top-tier schools, participating in research culminating in a presentation or paper would make you a competitive applicant."
publichealth,One thought I would like to see your analysis on is the pros and cons of a small department/cohort versus a large department/cohort.
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"I appreciate the response. I didn't mention my personal passion for either field due to it not relating to my question on the path to a career. I am very confident in my choice for social work as well as aware of all the elements it brings. With that being said, counseling is definitely the reason why I became a psych major. It's a field of study that I would love to work in, however, I've found Healthcare social work to be something I'm more interested in. Nevertheless, I'm still just a college grad and am still exploring all my options for my future so thank you so much for the reply!"

publichealth,I graduated with an MPH a year ago.  Started my first job in November as a researcher in the biostats dept. Want tp become an epidemiologist in the future.
publichealth,"Thanks for the response! 

For those with a MD-MPH who still part time see patients, do you know what their day to day life is like? Does seeing patients detrack from their epiwork or does it add their knowledge/skill sets related to their epiwork responsibilities?

Why in general do you say MD/MPH is preferable? Seems like the last two years of MD are not super relevant if one wanted to be a full time epidemiologist yet your PHD background seems 100% relevant (correct me if I'm wrong)

Also, do you know anything about Emory's epi program? I've heard BU is a MPH factory so I'm not thrilled about going there. Emory is still an idea. 

Thank you again 

Edit: added spacing to make the wall of text look better haha."
publichealth,You can’t reason someone out of something they didn’t use reason to get into.
publichealth,"SAS is a coding language for statistics. You might have, say, a list of all the people in your study and their ages and want to get the average age. As a statistical coder, you couldn’t have to know the math behind how the stats work, but be able to troubleshoot when the coding doesn’t match up. Usually there’s a main coder and a secondary coder, you both do the same set of directions and compare to make sure everything is correct. They are pretty well paid (and if you are good, it can be very lucrative) and jobs are highly in demand and flexible. 

As far as pay, there’s a glut of masters level public health graduates, so competition for jobs is somewhat harsh. I ended up getting my PhD as well, and haven’t had any problems, but it definitely isn’t a sure thing for improving your pay. Some computer programming skills opens up job opportunities often in the same vein, and I think they usually have higher pay potential. That being said, I loved getting my graduate degrees, thought the work was quite interesting and fun, and continue to like my work. It’s just a risk. "
publichealth,"It could be that you're experiencing this for your core courses but class size may go down for your second-year coursework when you're able to focus on electives etc. I know that my program is super small and even our intro-level core courses were enormous, then later on class sizes go down to about 20 students. "
publichealth,"Unfortunately the hospital says that for a job description ""study coordinator 2"" you have to require an undergraduate degree (as I understand it). Without it the app will bounce from HR and the people doing the actual hiring will never see it. 
Other institutions have other rules but I guess that the next time we list a coordinator position we could try to list it as, BA/BS/MPH/SOCRA Cat 1 with experience or something similar - they might have a mechanism for that that I don't know about. I'll see what they say.
Thanks for pointing out https://www.socra.org/certification/ccrp-certification-exam/candidate-eligibility/ to me, that's helpful and I'll try to include it next time."
publichealth,"Thanks for the response. Is the reduced workforce in the public sector due to the recent budget cuts? I agree that a broad knowledge base is important.  I'm currently an intern with an EH&amp;S department of 1 and have been able to get both IH and safety experience, which has been good for me (I have much more of a scientific mind, so the IH portion comes easier to me, while I am still working to be comfortable with safety management).

publichealth,"Working with restaurants is pretty variable. Its just working with people, and that can go very well or not great. I can still go into my old jurisdiction and I have managers and staff greet me warmly and stop and catch up, and probably my favorites are my managers/chefs that have improved and are so proud to show me what they’ve fixed or how they have changed their habits. And then I have my places who love to sneer at me and say “I’ve been cooking longer than you’ve been alive” True but that’s weird because I learned that beef can’t lay out on the countertop at 67f like, the first day. I honestly prefer the people that just cuss me out haha

I will say though post exposure is pricey and can be a big medical bill, but rabies is 100% fatal (with 2? exceptions in history). In that case though, the sheriff was certain they were on something so logic was probably pretty minor in their decision making."

publichealth,"Get experience before you commit to the PhD. It's not just to make you a competitive candidate. I know quite a few individuals who regret getting a PhD, and they had experience before enrolling. Depending on what you want to do, the PhD might not be super advantageous. It's also a huge commitment, so  it's to your benefit to be really sure it's what you want."
publichealth,NEXT!
publichealth,"Totally just realized now you weren’t the OP. Shows how much I pay attention in the app. -_- 

Glad to know others are in the same boat though!"
publichealth,"Yeah sure, the program went really well. I had a hiccup at the end over the internship and miscommunication, but otherwise no issues. 

I did most of my work on the weekends.  I took 1 course at a time until the last semester I doubled up.   While working full time, one course was very manageable, the semester I took 2 felt like quadruple the work instead of double.   There were a couple of really challenging courses but I already work in public health so I had a lot of help from co workers. They do offer online tutoring, I didn't have to use it but I know some students who did and it helped them.  

Not sure if you have experience in online courses but it is really important that you be assertive from the get-go.  Lastly, take the intro course seriously.  I could really tell by the writing of my class mates who did and who did not have a background in public health (there were many nurses and some military), you need to grasp that concept of the health of the whole community versus the health of individuals."
publichealth,"Best of luck!  And really, don't get caught up in degrees.  Solid training and experience are always worth the effort IMO."
publichealth,"The clinical work inspired me to pursue global health because I was a bilingual counselor that wanted to make a larger impact. Job experience alone didn’t prepare me for the work I’m doing, the MPH really strengthened my research and public health knowledge and skills that one wouldn’t really pick up with just a psych degree. Things like capacity building, epi/demographic/nutritional transitions, health economics, social determinants of health, policy analysis, and global health agreements/strategy were all topics the MPH covered that my BA didn’t. "
publichealth,"Keeping program size as the only factor, larger is better in nearly every scenario. Larger programs offer more diverse experience, more opportunities, and usually a better brand name. A small program indicates a lack of funding or focus in the concentration.

Any negative associated with a large program is easily overcome if you take the initiative to approach faculty to find mentors, advisors, and work on programs.

However, sometimes programs restrict their cohort size in order to offer better financial aid packages, teaching assistantships, etc; especially if they have a mission to train professionals for a specific geographic area. The above still applies, but you need to weigh the cost-benefit yourself to see what makes sense."
publichealth,"I'll add Hopkins to my list, and well as Columbia. Mine is a 2.8, but I'll explain in the circumstances that this was due to an undiagnosed illness. By the time I graduated, my grades skyrocketed. My main redeeming quality is really my work/field experiences.
What other schools did you able to?"

publichealth,"If you are in the policy review/auditing side of public health, the HealthCare Information Security and Privacy Practitioner \(HCISPP\) is a good emerging certification for the health\-care minded Security &amp; Privacy officer, if doing technical system reviews on EHR's and such is your main jam."
publichealth,"I graduated May 2017 with my MPH. About 5 months ago got my first job as an infection preventionist, a position typically held by RNs. 

With my position, a nursing degree would be helpful in some aspects clinically, but overall I feel like the knowledge I lack initially can be learned over time. 

So I would ask, what is it you want to end up doing? I think in the coming years (and this is purely speculation), nursing degrees won’t be needed as much for administrative positions due to the huge need for floor nurses. Then, people with MPH/MHA degrees will be in greater demand for administrative roles. "
publichealth,"I really appreciate you taking the time in giving your thoughts.

A bit more context\- I just graduated with a Bachelor's in public health, and have a job with my local university extension program in food access. I enjoy the work, but the pay is not great \($24,000/year plus benefits\). I could definitely see myself enjoying working in community nutrition, but my dream job is being a professor\- teaching and doing research on disease control in developing countries. 

By going to the larger university for my MPH, I could explore more public health topics and get more diversity of experience, get a better research background, be nearer to large funding streams, and network with professors who are at the forefront of their fields. It would make it easier to get into top PhD programs. Really, it's the door to my dream job. However, I know I could also eventually become a professor by going to my local university, but it would lock me in to community nutrition work, since that is basically all the research and programming we do here. It's definitely the safer option. I'm just having a hard time determining if the opportunity cost is more than $80,000 over the next ten years, like you said..."
publichealth,"I would say unless you're going to the London School of Hygiene, there is no value in studying internationally. The value comes from working internationally. In a school, you're looking for professors with international work in your area of interest, and a strong set of core epidemiology and biostatistics classes.

I was in a similar position to you. I chose Johns Hopkins because of the incredibly high international placement rates. It worked out well, I've worked closely or within each of the organizations you listed. Look into the MPH/Peace Corps program, or the MSPH. The MPH is a one year program, so it's similar to price to the others listed.

Another program would be George Washington University, purely due to its location. They have an internship program with PAHO you might be interested in."
publichealth,"would you tell me the school you went to and would taking the course online makes a difference?

publichealth,"Yeah, this is a good idea. I'm doing this already but I had to learn about this when I was looking for my current job. They use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to parse through resumes. "
publichealth,"""The literature is mixed"" is the operative phrase here. People use cannabis to affect their sleep and our funder was interested in knowing if it actually worked for that purpose. See, Colorado collected a pile of tax money from Medical Marijuana over the years and there was a legislative push to investigate the therapeutic effects that were being claimed. This was one of the focus areas; does it work? Does it cause any problems that aren't obvious? Is there any indication that a certain varietal or method of use is more efficacious for initiating sleep? How about maintaining sleep once it's initiated? The first step in understanding this is to get granular data on a bunch of people who are using it for sleep and a bunch of people who are doing other things for sleep and compare them. 100% observational at this point but observing patterns is hypothesis generating. Of course in the current climate of cannabis research there is no option for an RCT using cannabis products you can purchase, only NIDA products so that's a problem. We'd like to dose cannabis naive participants with specific sleep problems with say edibles vs vape vs smoked products and look at route of delivery, dose and all that but, nope, not in the cards right now."
publichealth,"Hi OP,

I've got an MPH in Biostats and a BA in Poli Sci and somewhere in between I considered a few law schools, but had no desire to go that route.  For what it's worth, some schools even have [JD/MPH crossovers](https://www.law.temple.edu/academics/degrees/dual-degrees/jd-mph/), but I've never seen one in the wild and wouldn't know exactly why anyone would need that set of credentials. 

I worked for several years with different health focused nonprofits doing survey work and grants management before getting my MPH.  Health policy was one of my hobby horses in Poli Sci and I imagined that my contribution to the field could be facilitating the clinical work of different organizations that aligned with my policy ideology (Hint: universal healthcare).  A lot of local non-profits are based on poorly organized good intentions.  They would love to have someone do the paperwork, the administrative piece, so that they could get out from under it and focus on their core mission, but after collating an endless waterfall of forms for several years, I was less enamored with the job, but enjoyed the data work immensely.  We'll say it was a 70/30 split between administrative chaff and analytic forecasting.  

Somewhere in there, the grants stopped being about serving as many people as we could clinically and instead shifted to finding evidence based methods around how to do the work smarter and how to get insights that would forward population health; marginal gains for a broader and sustained improvement.  And now I work as a biostatistician/analyst, crunching data and designing experiments.   

Now, this is all occurring over 20 years or so at a half-dozen organizations, working full-time during undergrad and grad school, sometimes getting my classes comped, sometimes working long hours or skipping vacations and birthdays to complete projects, and now I would certainly say that it's a worthy endeavor, but in the middle of it all, the low pay, the grind, the 'dues' you have to pay, Public Health can be a thankless field where the quality of your work is the only reward.  I love what I do now, it helps a lot of people, but from an uncertain start to this space here and now, the middle was a slog.  Of course, personally I could never have committed to any specific career in my early 20's and I certainly wouldn't have picked biostatistician/analyst or anything in that stream.  

If I had to make any recommendation for you it would be to just jump in and swim.  Find an organization that relates to your interest and see what you can do to work with them. 
      "
publichealth,"Of course, this is a very good point. I meant that EIS is a good gateway into the top areas in Epi. I must profess that I am ingnorant of other ways to enter the CDC unless you have extensive work experience.

From your experience are MD-MPH's or MPH-PHD's more qualified for the workplace in the CDC (I know the work varies, but I'm trying to think in general). I wish I didn't have to ask this kind of question and that I could just instinctually tell which route I would rather go down, but at this point I can't tell which I would like better. Knowing which path would help me be more qualified and resourceful in respects to working at an organization like the CDC might help me decide one way or another."
publichealth,"SAS programming certification is one I’ve used. "
publichealth,"This is more or less what I expected. I'm planning on doing a lot of very entry level work right before I go for my MPH, so I think I'll be good on that. I don't have a specific plan, but I'm shooting for an interdisciplinary resemue "
publichealth,i came here to say this
publichealth,"Honestly, it is really difficult to change people's beliefs, and if you don't communicate in an effective way \(for instance suggesting someone's beliefs are dumb\) you will push them further into their belief set. Science and numbers don't appeal to a lot of people, so this isn't the way to approach the matter. 

One trick I have \(for in person communication, not via facebook\) is asking people more and more about their beliefs: Where did you hear that? Why do you feel this way? Can you tell me more about that? etc. Ask in a non\-judgmental way, and sometimes you can ask people so many questions they start to doubt themselves. 

Another trick is storytelling. People respond really well to stories. So if you can find stories that will challenge someone's beliefs while simultaneously resonating with their human side, you may be able to make some progress this way too. "
publichealth,"If you have a good understanding of the US system, knowing about other systems can aid in understanding of the US system.

publichealth,"Hey, my wife is a MPH student at Emory, focusing on Health Management. From what she says epi isn’t too difficult, however, at least at emory it requires mastery of SAS. Once you get the basics of bio stats down it becomes more about inputting data and analyzing it rather than doing the actual calculations. Doesn’t seem as tough as what biostasticians have to do. She also took an epi course at Emory and says it’s not too bad. As for employment, Epi is highly desirable for candidates. However, a lot of positions require a doctorate in it. Though in comparison to Behavioral sciences, Epi definitely gives an edge to any applicant as it exemplifies not only conceptual knowledge, but analytical skills as well. At the end of the day you will excel at what you enjoy, and that’s the best way to approach your question.  
"
publichealth,"I graduated with a B.S. in Health Sciences from a relatively new, unknown state school and got into every (12/12) program I applied to (MPH/MSPH epi/global epi). I applied to Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Emory, Hopkins, GW, UMN, UMich, BU, NYU, Vanderbilt, and Brown. I overapplied since I was worried about the same thing.

I think ultimately it boils down to your experiences and essays-- even though your background isn't in public health, can you prove that you want to pursue a career in it? How has your background in Health Sciences led you there? 

Also, excelling in a variety of hard science classes &amp;/or research shows that you have perseverance &amp; a strong work ethic, which is definitely a positive!

I'll be attending Emory this fall due to a 50% scholarship + work-study funds, love for the environment, and a dream of working at the CDC! Good luck applying!"
publichealth,"I didn't even visit Columbia after I found out I wasn't getting a scholarship (apparently my quant GRE was just below the 80% cutoff). Combined with the cost of living, there's no way I could have justified attending."
publichealth,"Hey, Health\_inspector7, just a quick heads-up:  
**accross** is actually spelled **across**. You can remember it by **one c**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
publichealth,"That’s probably what I’ll end up doing! I’ve got my eye on University of Michigan - Ann Arbor and Emory especially because they have great RPCV scholarships and communities. "
publichealth,"It's hard to say. I have only worked for this public health district. I would guess it would be similar nationally, but I couldn't say for sure. The area I cover is massive, the county I cover in whole is the size of Delaware, my total coverage area has a population of about 15000, no stoplights, no fast food joints, and the biggest city is about 4000 strong. Funding is a big issue with such a small tax base and such a big area, there is certainly enough work for more than one person."
publichealth,I work in government as an epi and I would have never imagined how much I have to interact with people. I definitely got over my anxiety for calling strangers pretty fast.
publichealth,"About 35 for Gen eds, anywhere from 5 to 25 for classes taylored towards my major."
publichealth,"Thanks! I come from a different background/career so this is all new to me. "
publichealth,"How’d you do in your stats classes? I found calculus to be challenging but stats to be very enjoyable. I’m about to start my MPH in epi, and the only undergrad course requirement was statistics, not calc. The coursework will mostly be epi and biostats courses. If you like stats, or even think that you could knuckle your way through two years of stats, I’d go for epi."
publichealth,"My MPH program didn't require tracks. You could concentrate in certain departments, but you could also customize your concentration to be whatever you wanted. So maybe that's how OP's program was as well."
publichealth,"I was a program coordinator for an early childhood nutrition and physical activity program at a small non-profit. I worked there for about 2 years before pursuing an MPH in health behavior and health education. I'm now at a large non-profit research organization and primarily focus on evaluating US-based chronic disease prevention programs. If you have any interest at all in doing research, I would highly recommend working at a contract research organization for a couple of years where you could explore many different content areas and develop a wide array of skills. The bachelors level analysts I work with in my current position are some of the smartest people I know, and they pretty much always get accepted at their top choice graduate program. Best of luck to you!  "
publichealth,So what's a good alternative other than law school?
publichealth,"What is your opinion of Columbia's MPH program? It's one of the few US schools that do not explicitly require relevant working experience. "
publichealth,"I work in EMR.... honestly I would get an MBA if what you want is to move into leadership role. Maybe even MHA since it's hospital . 

"
publichealth,"Even if you’re in a distance program, talk with your classmates! Undoubtedly some of them will be working in the public health  field and can provide some insight to their jobs, their agencies, and how to obtain positions. "
publichealth,"Your wage potential will be higher with the health policy and management \(if the management is with regard to being say a hospital administrator\), however I originally got into an MPH program for health policy and found myself way too bored so I switched concentrations. I didn't switch to Epi, but I really enjoyed the epi courses I took. 

Good luck!"
publichealth,"I'm an epidemiologist and I have to talk to people constantly. I call hospitals, labs, health departments and providers most days related to surveillance issues and to provide education. Depending on what area of epidemiology you were to work in you could be required to talk to strangers a lot and play health educator to some degree. 

Money wise, it sounds like you would probably be best skipping the MPH. In my state epis in government start at entry level and move up based on years of epi experience. This varies by state so it's worth looking into. 

You don't need to be good at math to be an epidemiologist. We don't use a lot of complex math and we tend to use the same types of analysis fairly often. I could explain this better if you're interested but what it comes down to relationships and the number of variables. Don't be intimidated by biostatistics. "
publichealth,"My hope is to pursue a PhD afterward and become a professor. I can certainly do that no matter what MPH program I do, but I guess my concerns comes down to the question\- do professors that come from top universities make more than those that come from smaller universities? Enough so to justify going into debt for an MPH?"
publichealth,"I think you should take the position at the hospital. Experience is experience. Holding out means you might risk going months (or longer) without *any* experience, which is much worse than having vaguely related experience in the ""wrong"" sector. And if nothing comes your way in government in the next months, then you're back to where you are now, except with no experience or pay to show for it. Take the position, gain experience in public health, and build skills and networks.

Work outside the government sector won't prevent you from entering the government sector. It *might* make it difficult only because you might not have the network within the field, but that just means you need to put in a little more work building your network. 

And you may start at a lower position without direct experience, but that's a relatively minor downside in your first few years. Especially since you'll have outside experience of some kind so you should be somewhere between someone fresh out of grad school and someone with direct experience in government."
publichealth,"Data entry at the state health department, epidemiologist at the same health department, now public health specialist at the world bank."
publichealth,Just graduated with a MPH. Biostats and Epi are related with the math aspect. If you don't like math then I'd choose the lesser evil
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"The job market for me right after my MPH was bad, but not as bad as you described. Its unfortunate for sure, but I imagine it may be more difficult for foreign students.

I kept a detailed Excel spreadsheet of jobs I applied to, the contact person for that job, date of interview #1 and #2, and the final outcome. Based on my job search data, I applied to a total of 54 jobs over a course of about 4 months before I got my current position. I had 5 phone screen interviews, and 3 in person interviews. "
publichealth,"I worked for a health insurance company.

I learned a lot about policy and administrative stuff; it's not sexy, but it's actually very helpful to know about."

publichealth,"Disease control in developing countries is my area of research, specifically disease surveillance. I'll go for the hard sell: I am biased, but I would suggest you attend the top tier school if your ultimate goal is international work and academia. Especially since name recognition matters in academia. Success is 50&amp;#37; luck and 50&amp;#37; recognizing and taking opportunities as they are presented.

It is easier to get into PhD after attending the same school for MPH, the best in the field will become your advisors, you'll finish the Phd faster, and will probably get a better funding package. More importantly, you'll have options. Disease dynamics, health systems strengthening, community approaches, mobile phone interventions? Someone in your program wrote the WHO guidance. Want experience in WHO, CDC, MSF, USAID? No problem, a professor is seconded and heading up their XYZ intervention. I was afforded the opportunity to design the entirety of the reporting and case detection parts of a surveillance system for a small developing country. My MPH friends were given practicum experiences around the world. Most also joined research projects at average rate of around $25 an hour for 19 hours a week during the school year.

It depends on the relative strength of the two programs, but a new program which is focusing on transportation barriers and behavior change in nutrition won't provide you with nearly the same experience. You can find your dream job either way, but you can pay for a massive boost or start free with a handicap. I've been lucky with salaries in this field, but I know $80k is a significant investment to make, even if it's in yourself.

Not an easy decision, good luck."
publichealth,"You definitely don't need calculus to understand epidemiology. At its most basic level, epi is problem solving. What food did everyone eat that made them sick? If someone is walking to the store to buy cigarettes and is hit by a car, did the cigarettes kill them? How many times do kids put their butts and mouths over those water jets that come out of the ground in water play areas? (Seriously, I attended a presentation on that one). Stuff like that. Epi is a HUGE field and can be applied to almost any topic area. It's useful (and cheaper) if you can learn how to do your own stats, but outside of the taught coursework you don't technically need to do it in your job - just dont go into an analyst position. Behavioral sciences is much more limited in the scope of what you were trying to solve or figure out. So if you want to leave your options more open, epi is the way to go. Hope that helps!!"
publichealth,"Facebook will let you report posts with incorrect information and they sometimes delete the posts. That's what I do when the poster isn't receptive to the actual science. I think posts that get reported more times are more likely to disappear, so getting mutual friends to report those same posts will help even more."
publichealth,"My official title is Community-Based Research Liaison - what this has meant in practice is that I provide the link between the organizers that are members of a grassroots coalition and the funder that led to this coalition being created by evaluating the coalition and the communities they work in using CBPR techniques. I also assist with grant-writing (we're at $74,000 in my 9 months of service!) and other administrative/technical assistance tasks to help build the capacity of the coalition"
publichealth,"Higher Ed jobs.com. Hospitals for research coordinator jobs "
publichealth,"It depends on your topic. Like another user mentioned, you will do the systematic review in the process of a meta\-analysis. However, meta\-analyses are projects unto themselves and depending on what you're synthesizing \(risk ratios, prevalence rates, etc.\) can be very time consuming. I'd recommend looking into how to do a meta\-analysis \(two articles that might be useful are""Meta\-analysis in medical research"" and ""Meta\-Analysis in Epidemiology""\) and going from there.

Since you're BA level I would guess that a systematic review, with a table or two summarizing your findings, would be suitable. I'm not sure if you're planning to continue into an MPH and/or doing more research on your topic, but the review could be framed as the foundation for a future meta\-analysis.

Good luck!"

publichealth,"This is amazing. Thank you so so much!
edit: what would you recommend for an applicant that had a &lt;3.0 GPA?"
publichealth,"Depending on what schools you want to apply and their program, your biotech experience might just fit the bill. I was in biotech (pharmaceuticals) and applied and got in to a California state university program. Most programs will have a statement of purpose as part of the application, be sure to clearly explain WHY you want to be in public health and how an MPH will help get you there. Good luck!! "
publichealth,"Can you defer admission to the program you've been accepted for until a decision is made \(if the mid\-June decision is true\) just to ensure you have both options open? Accreditation really is really important, and I hate for you to waste your time on a program that wouldn't have it post\-grad. "
publichealth,"Broad generalizations incoming:

MD/PhD: Usually a paid dual program which is heavily oriented towards research. Pros: Paid, highly valued, huge boost towards working in leadership roles. Cons: Takes a long time to complete

PhD/MPH: Will have the best epi-skillset. Good at research and research translation. Better at analysis assessing epidemics. Often work at the systems level in addition to managing the details of an outbreak. Pros: Versatile combination which can work in a lot of areas of PH, good at research. PhD required for most high level PH work. Cons: Can be unpaid unless funding is available, less valuable than an MD in some settings.

MD/MPH: Mix of clinical and PH knowledge. Usually not great at data analysis and Epi, but superior at actual epidemic control (IPC, treatment etc). Pros: Good for leadership positions, can do clinical work for income supplement. Cons: Will have less hard skills in epi, expensive

Bonus: DrPH: Newish degree which is meant for PH practioners rather than PH researchers. Meant to be completed post-professional, often online/part-time while in a job. MD/DrPH is common mix.

publichealth,George Washington also has a fully online program I believe!
publichealth,"I've traveled world and I wish I did it after I had my shit together. Most people I ran into decided to take time off after they already finished their masters/doctoral, and had 5 years experience in the field. Go travel the world in your mid 30s. You will still be young and you will have a killer resume when you need to find a job when you get back. Get to the Finish Line then reward yourself. :)"
publichealth,"TLDR- children, aged 4-9 years old, that were just told how to properly handle a gun did not show any improvement in gun handling weeks later when put into a room w/ a nonfunctional gun.

The authors did cite that a more hands-on approach has better results, when compared to just being provided information, but that is still not that effective.

Bottom line, parents that own guns and store them at home need to be responsible adults. The parents need to a) teach their kids how to properly handle a gun, b) make sure the guns are properly and safely stored away from any access by kids, and c) just use their brains instead of putting on blinders and thinking their kids will just figure it out."
publichealth,I can't read this article can you post it? It's behind a paywall.
publichealth,"It's highly variable, both among schools and even within them- during my Master's program, class size for me ranged from 4 to 75+.  Typically, the first year/core requirement courses are much more crowded, but once you start getting into courses that are specific to your major or concentration, the class size should decrease substantially."
publichealth,"I’ve worked for NYC DOHMH and can personally attest to the fitness of healthcare workers/those w. experience in healthcare settings to join the agency. They have many departments and, further still, teams within those departments. The one I worked for specifically focused on healthcare quality improvement. I worked on building connections between primary care practices/CHCs/FQHCs and community- and Faith-based organizations that offer preventive/self-management programs in order to get high-risk patients referred. Understanding the demands on the healthcare team, the structure &amp; workflows of their environment, and policies which incentivize their participation in certain public health programs will help you very much! Take the job! "
publichealth,"For an entry level job, perhaps. i would try to get data analysis experience also along with coursework.

So I'm a Director of Biostats for a pharma company.. I have an MPH in Epi and PhD in Population Health Sciences. Neither are biostats degrees. If you can demonstrate you have the knowledge and can do the work then you would get the job. Employers only care about getting the job done and not your degree."
publichealth,"Yeah, the program is only a few years old at the university where I work. Up until recently, I had never even considered it as an option, seeing as it isn't a proven program. I haven't even applied, but I know the faculty in the program and they tell me that I could be in as quickly as I said I wanted in. I think the idea of taking on $80k in debt has weighed on me to the point that I've now started looking for a way to avoid it. But ultimately I think I would be giving up on my dreams by settling for the lesser school."
publichealth,"That is so cool, can I pm you about the process of getting into americorps? "
publichealth,"I thought that price was not worth it either, but it seems like that is how much typical MPH programs cost.  Surprisingly, if you include cost of living, US programs run more expensive than the European programs I've been looking at, but maybe I've just completely missed the good (but cheap) programs in the US.

Mind you I also feel confident in getting some sort of tuition assistance, and seeing as I am making 32k/year now and most jobs I've seen that required a MPH start at 45-50k/year, I think that 2 years of 30-50k in debt pays off within 3-6 years and the rest is profit.  I do think its doable to get into one of the cheaper 60k programs.

And most positions that I am currently eligible for in the Peace Corps are volunteer positions or they are in fields of study that don't interest me as much, and seem to be geared more towards getting into a Masters program.  I'm less worried about getting in, and more worried about paying for and finding a job after, so paying extra to get better connections might be worth it."
publichealth,"It's possible if you have a strong record of scholarship. It's not unusual for medical doctors to get n MPH, but most use the skillset in a practice. In short, while you would meet the minimum standard, you may not stand out as a competitive candidate for a top program.

JHU particularly focuses international admissions on students with a research intersest and experience (epidemiology, health systems, community, doesn't matter) and those who are intent to return to their country and work in public service. The research experience does not need to be extensive, you can do case studies, assess clinical knowledge, look into the burden of disease, it's more about process than content."
publichealth,"Thanks for the response, sounds like you have had an awesome career path.  Appreciate the advice and am excited to hear about the future opportunity in this field.  "
publichealth,"Core classes will be larger, and concentration specific classes are smaller."
publichealth,"Take the internship. 

"
publichealth,Then maybe you shouldn’t have asked questions that are answered literally in the first sentence of that Wikipedia page.
publichealth,probably in Singapore!!
publichealth,"I think it’s less a question if it’s doable, and more a question if future employers might wonder whether the full-time course load was too fast-paced for you. I would even think it’s doable to travel while enrolled full-time in Europe. Most countries are a short train or plane flight away - also students typically have breaks both during the semester and months in between (such as winter and summer break). If you think of anyone that has taken even a semester studying abroad, they will have often traveled many places while the program being full time. I suppose it’s a matter of what you want out of traveling and what you want out of your time in graduate school."
publichealth,What the fuck is going on
publichealth,"I'm currently a research coordinator at a major hospital in East Coast. I applied straight out of undergrad and went through what you're going through now. 

I started getting interviews when I tailored each resume to include keywords that were in a job requisition. Sometimes I even copied+pasted an entire phrase on job requisition onto my resume. I was NOT falsifying anything, I was simply using their way of wording rather than my way. These hospitals receive thousands of apps so I suspect they use some form of software to scan for keywords first before the resume even lands on someone's desk. If you're already doing that, sorry for being unhelpful but I hope the tip at least helps someone else."
publichealth,"Thank you! I appreciate your insight. "
publichealth,"How much will you expect to owe at the end? These are pretty different fields each, but which has the best option for jobs? Any stats on job placement rates within 6 months of graduation (specifically, with jobs in the field--not working at Target or Home Depot to cover bills)?"
publichealth,"Soo many since last May. And a whole bunch of interviews. Took me about 6 months to land my first job as a research assistant working with a biostatistician and research investigator, as well doctors and clinical nurses. I'm interested in Epidemiology and am working my way up. Hopefully this will pan out in the end. "
publichealth,"I completely agree with this. I always worked while in school, and it always helped me understand the coursework better, plus it gave me better options when I graduated when compared to my friends who didn't work or had jobs outside of the field. "
publichealth,"Yeah, I think it's a really exciting and constantly progressing field.  I got started through my MPH's externship program where I worked on updating a PH Emergency Communications Plan for a local health department, which lead to the offer for the part-time Planning Assistant position.  Through my two years there, I gained enough FEMA training and experience with exercises and some real incidents like H1N1 responses that I was able to move to another health department as the Emergency Planner, running my own shop essentially.  

One of the most exciting things is when we have an incident or planned event that we are able to put all the planning and preparing into action.  Since I've started in the field, I've responded to white powder incidents, tornados, hurricanes, measles, TB, EVD scares, and then Zika Virus.  It seems like there is always something new coming along to prepare for and keeps you on your toes, plus I love collaborating with the other partners to have nice products of living Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Plans.  I'm also really interested in Epidemiology so PHEP and Epi go hand-in-hand in a lot of PH EM responses, too.  

The only problem with the field of PHEP is that there are a very limited number of jobs and it's hard to move around unless you're willing to actually move to a different city.  I've lived in a different city for each of my jobs.  "
publichealth,"Depending on your jurisdiction, you will likely need additional coursework in order to earn a microbiologist certificate. How much do you really love lab work?"
publichealth,"I was looking at programs that have strong connections with international organizations (WHO, USAID, World Bank, UNICEF, etc..) because those are the types of jobs that I would be looking at.  The University of Utah has tuition not too far off from the numbers I gave (~$14k/year for resident)  At current rent here, even for a reasonable place at $1000/month comes out to $52k for the program... and that's before buying food and other necessities of life.

And tuition is still only half the program cost.  Where you are living for $300 in rent seems impossible to me.  Even in Utah where I live and rent is relatively cheap, I would be paying $1000 (at best) and more like $1200 for my place which is the difference between $7200 for rent and $24000 for rent which is where most of the money is going.  Even with low tuition, the rent is what is making the difference between your estimates and mine.  (given tuition, rent, and a low $250 for food per month you're estimated cost of the program is $36k.  If you account for higher rent [$1000 per month] even your lower cost school would go all the way up to $53k which is putting it into the ballpark of the higher prices I suggested --- note these numbers are for 2 year programs)

And while paying back loans in that short amount of time might be very optimistic, I think it is more that the increased income over years pays for itself even if you pay off the loan slowly.  When you're making $10k+ per year, even with student loan payments you are better off than before IMO.

[EDIT] After doing some research on Geneva (my top choice), it looks like I could do a long-term AirBNB which could lower my expected rent costs to as low as $930 for a small-ish studio apartment, which would put my expected costs closer to $45k.  Much more reasonable."
publichealth,"I'm pretty sure the MPH@GW has a spring semester start date. It's an online program, so I'm not sure how you feel about those, but it is accredited. You can also take some credits on campus if you will be in the Washington D.C. area. But the online curriculum does 10 week segments year-round ranging from 1-3 years."
publichealth,Honestly that was my first thought too until I was told the woman mentioned to my mom's friend that airlines (and cruise companies too apparently...?) actually need people with MPH degrees working for their companies.
publichealth,I'm doing AmeriCorps based in a county health department right now and it's been great! My undergrad was in international relations so it's helped me sort out that public health is what I want to do - I'll start my MPH less than a week after my AmeriCorps service ends later this year!
publichealth,"My roommate's sister went to BU for the MPH, MS might be a different ball game, but a big issue is large class sizes, and the difficulty some people have with finding a practicum, maybe because of the large number of MPH students in Boston and the competition.  The faculty are always tinkering with the curriculum, sometimes in small ways, sometimes larger changes have been made.  BU is a solid school in many different areas, but they don't excel in any specific areas, such as other schools which have a draw due to being stellar in some field, they are a middle tier public health school.  Not especially rigorous coursework, but good on social-related public health issues.  The school makes a real effort to get faculty to interview for news stations and, as somebody else noted, for publications to boost awareness of the school."
publichealth,"I think I applied to like 15\-20 places. I had the added bonus of trying to move cross\-country \(my spouse got transferred just before my last semester\), so I was applying to jobs in a city where I had very little connection.

I started applying in February ahead of my May graduation. I had two phone interviews in early April, then a second phone interview and an in\-person interview at the end of April with the place where I work now. I also then got a counter offer in early May from the place I was working at the time to replace a coworker who was retiring.

The job market varies by field. IH/OH is definitely a networking game over numbers and I was reaching out to regional AIHA and ASSE chapters for assistance in my job hunt. In any field really, network network network."
publichealth,Of course!
publichealth,"I second this. I graduated with my M.S. in Health Education at the end of 2016 and have been working in tobacco control and prevention for the past year now. It's become a very big focus point right now in my state (Ohio). 

OP, make sure you develop good relationships with the staff at your internship. You'll be using them and your internship coordinator as a reference for future jobs and seek them out as mentors. If things go well, you could potentially transition into a full time position there after you finish your internship. Even if you don't see yourself doing work with tobacco down the road, it's a good first step into a career in public health. Especially if you are interested in policy (think 100% tobacco-free schools/colleges, tobacco-free parks, passing local ordinances regulating the amount of tobacco retailers near schools, pressuring FDA to regulate e-cigs and stricter regulations on flavors in tobacco products including menthol, etc.). "
publichealth,"Conspiracy theorists aren't responsive to facts, otherwise they wouldn't be conspiracy theorists.  You'll never get through to them no matter how good your sources if they don't believe in the underlying principles of science, deduction, and reasoning. 

I know because I tried arguing on Facebook with them. Citing reputable news outlets, directing them to peer reviewed studies, pointing out fundamental flaws in their logic. No impact. I eventually just unfollowed them and was happier for it."
publichealth,"If you had good work and study habits in undergrad you should be okay.  Class size is smaller and you will have to read much more. There is no bullshitting, professors will know if you don't read as discussion is pretty much expected from you.  I found it to be easier compared to undergrad just because you really have a focus (and many of the material overlap) as opposed to juggling a whole bunch of courses that vary in topic in undergrad.

Also, dont be intimidated by others in the program. I was too when I started but eventually that subsided as you build networks with these individuals. Remember you are in this together.  And for the most part, I agree with everyone saying to find job/internship that you have an interest in.  It is better to build that right now as it could potentially benefit you for a field experience or capstone requirement.  For myself, I wish I would have done this.  I ended up taking on some projects just out of convenience that I really had no interest in just to fulfill the requirements for the program.
"
publichealth,"See, that's the part that really throws up a red flag for me... they don't have a timeline listed on the school's site. 

According to the CEPH's website the decision is due mid-June, but I'd have to apply by June 1 in order to receive the scholarship. "
publichealth,"Same here. Interested in family planning, adolescent sexual health, and STD prevention but found myself in an internship for the American Lung Association. Very worthwhile experience and I got to work with leaders in the tobacco prevention field. Make the most of it while you're there. You can learn applicable skills that will be transferable, should you find a position more suited to your interests.

Mind if I ask where you are located? I can provide you with a good list of health care agencies and organizations in the DC area (a Policy hotbed!)."
publichealth,"I wrote to my old supervisor

Although in my opinion the response was BS overall, my name will be included . 

This isn't even a publication, it's just a report... that circulates the entire 5 county region - the place I will wokr in for the next decade as I have kids and my husband works here .

This report  was build by me, all the words are mine, and it is a product of mine  that shows my abilities (I am early career) to have someone else put their name on it, and remove me, makes it almost seem like it's not my work, and it allows people to question the wokr I did do. Was it really mine or did this other person do it and you claiming credit "
publichealth,"I'm technically an epi major but my interests (and future job) lean more towards biostats so apply what I say as you see fit. Also, as others have said, your work experience alone should guarantee admission to any good biostats program. Very good padding indeed! :)

Anyways, here are my tips for preparing yourself :

1. Learn some basic statistics if you haven't already. If you didn't take any stats courses in undergrad, you can either take an online course or take a community college course or something. Having a basic knowledge of stats will make the introductory classes, and the statistical software classes, much easier to deal with.

2. You don't really have to teach yourself R beforehand, but if you really enjoy it, by all means go ahead! More and more organizations are using it now, and I've personally found R to be very easy and intuitive for self-teaching. Plus, all the resources you'll need for it are free!

3. As for the other languages such as SAS, STATA, SUDAAN, etc., I'd hold off on learning those until you're already in a biostats MPH program taking classes on them. Whichever university you go to will likely have the (very expensive) licenses for these programs already, and since you'll probably be learning the languages there anyways, it's better to learn it through your tuition instead of out of pocket. 

Hope this helps!"
publichealth,"Free.  Definitely free.  

The MPH is a generalist's degree.  It doesn't teach expertise, but rather the orientation necessary to build expertise in an applied setting.  Fieldwork, which is the defining aspect of an MPH degree, is the avenue for that applied knowledge, and you can do this strongly anywhere.  Free is certainly better. 

Further, MPH grads are excellent researchers and are competitive for a PhD program, if that's your interest, but really it's a working degree.  The root of MPH research overwhelmingly tends to be community oriented and translational.  It's not a classic ivory tower degree.  You can find opportunities to publish and you could arrange your fieldwork to resemble a thesis of sorts, but really MPH students build interventions, run programs, and evaluate outcomes, publishing is a secondary function.  I relay this because rather than compare a free MPH program to one at $80k, if you want to position yourself for a PhD (Which I think is miserable work), you'll be better off seeking an MS with a thesis option and focusing on publishing, publishing, and publishing.  At least that would be optimal.  And really if you're treating the MPH like a stepping stone and not the terminal degree that it is, go for free.  Free is is definitely better."
publichealth,"That's a good idea, and definitely one option that I'll keep in mind. Thanks! It's encouraging to hear from a HPM grad with a good experience. What kind of work have you been doing since graduating?"
publichealth,"There's nothing like networking in person. If there's any way you can afford it, do the MPH in person and network like hell while you can. If that’s really not an option, get to a conference early on, network there and aim for 3-4 more throughout your course where you're likely to meet up with the same people. Build yourself a network but that will inevitably include having to interact face-to-face. Good luck!"
publichealth,"Interested in econ, public health (at least epi/biostats) uses a lot of the same skills but is less soul-sucking and more personally fulfilling, and combines another interest of mine, medicine."
publichealth,"I'm an industrial hygienist working in a consulting group. There is no solid day to day, I'm literally doing something different every day. 

Most of the time I do industrial hygiene monitoring and write reports, but I also teach safety trainings, write programs for clients, and provide support work for a client with an understaffed EHS department.

The best part is the variety I get from consulting -- I've seen dozens of different industries and environments. 

The worst part is the unpredictable work load and schedule. While I mostly work days, my client's hours are my hours, and things can change at the drop of a hat. I've had to become a very flexible planner as a result.

Before entering the field, I wish I'd had more environmental science. I know the safety and IH part well but I'm still pretty clueless with environmental stuff. That's my professional development for next year I guess  (this year is taking the CIH exam)."
publichealth,"I think you're answering your own question, then."
publichealth,"These are my thoughts - TAKE THE POSITION!

I’m saying this because
     1.) the public health market is over-saturated at the current time 
     2.) Vietnam is a cool place to learn and study, I’m sure it will give you a leg up on competition

I’m interested about how you graduated with an MPH without a specific track, but from your undergrad experience, it seems like epi is where you should go. 

Anyway, good luck. Learn all that you can. If you have any further questions, please, reach out to me. 
"
publichealth,"Sorry for the late reply but I got it through an internship. I got the internship through my MPH school’s alumni connection. "
publichealth,Are there any fields of epidemiology with better job prospects in Ontario than infectious disease? I'm starting an Epidemiology MPH in the fall and wondering if there are ways to tailor the degree to make me more employable by the end of it.
publichealth,"Heavily discounted rather than free. 90% discount from the full fare plus taxes (ID90 fare) is common but you are on standby (dont have a confirmed seat). ID50 ie 50% of the full fare is also common and is a confirmed seat. Source: used to work as an airline ground handler for Qantas. "
publichealth,"Most of the paper work is issuing permits or finals with the appropriate lingo, and letters, I write a tone of letters. Most of those ltters are sent to homeowners to say HEY you need a permit to do this, but there is always a lot of policy issue letters to write too.

I am a one man band for my coverage area which encompasses all of one county and large parts of four other counties, so yes I am involved in all of the follow up and if we take someone to court well guess who else is going. 

If you do set up in a rural area then you need to be aware of programs that are available for those folks. Since it is an environmental issue and a sanitation issue there are often grants and the USDA is generally willing to lend to homeowners for those repairs."
publichealth,"I'd agree with the previous poster. It is essentially a multidisciplinary apprenticeship that trains you to become an autonomous researcher, capable of working in many different roles, with many different professionals. With the added bonus of having the population perspective on health. 

Because it's a PhD you can steer it in any direction you like. I am trying to steer mine towards biostatistics for evaluating clinical and cost effectiveness of interventions. So we can make more informed decisions on the best options for the limited budgets available in healthcare systems.

"
publichealth,"That basic job is recruiting participants and conducting the study visits following our protocol. That's a BS level set of skills coupled with motivation. If you have more skills and training then we'll pay you more because we'll ask you to do more. The job is coordinator II with specific minimum skills, if you're motivated and trained then you bring more to the table and we offer you more like top of the scale vs half way up the scale.

For instance we need participants enrolled, visits completed and data entered right? All of the instruments needed to do that are in place so getting the data into the computer is a function of typing speed. A few months ago I wanted to ask a different question using an instrument that didn't exist which had to be piloted, validated, the online data entry tool needed to be created and then the data needed to be cleaned so that I could use it as pilot for a grant. That was more of a masters level ask but the end result would have been an authorship for the coordinator with shared writing. A BS/BA coordinator might not have wanted to work on that project along with the day to day stuff and that would have been fine, I can do it myself it just keeps me from doing other stuff. I would have expected a masters level person spend some time in the literature and contribute scientifically. 

The terminal degree thing is different, if I want to hire a PhD then I'll expect that they go for their own funding, have their own research interests and their own collaborators. I'd tell them up front that I'm able to cover .5FTE and help them find the rest until they get on their feet, something like that. I'd specifically not hire a PhD for this position because they'd be bored by the day to day and they'd quit. This has happened several times at other places I've worked, you hire someone with a doctorate who is really just interested in getting their fingers in the door so that they can more on, they stay six months and leave as soon as they're trained and competent. We had one woman swear she'd give us a full year as a coordinator (different study) when she had already been accepted into nursing school out of state. We trained and paid her for a couple of months and then she didn't show up one day, she got her paycheck and moved away and we were back to square one."
publichealth,USF has very low GRE requirements like the bottom 13% works. It's the 16th best college of public health in the nation and is also fairly cheap because it's Florida.
publichealth,"Probably! I think what's frustrating for me is that I'm a program evaluator who ends up on contracts with messy programs that sound good conceptually, but don't actually do what the people running them think they do when you get into the weeds of it. A lot of times, it's because they don't have experience in intervention theory and they aren't addressing levels or barriers well. Health promotion sounds like an easy job- I mean, everyone has health and promoting health is an easy enough concept. It rarely works like it seems though. 

Also TIL that 3 universities in the US offer a MS in Health promotion. I'm in a state with a couple of MPH programs in health promotion, which is why it's odd to me why the programs don't go to those grads. "
publichealth,"You will always be at a disadvantage compared to traditional students. I go to 2-3 networking events a week minimum and even after two full semesters of that I still meet new people and grow my network at each one. Granted I go to more than the average mph student because of my involvement in the organizations that put the events on, but you can expect most driven traditional students to at least go to on campus networking events two or three times a month. If you want that experience then you need to move to your school and take advantage. 

However you do have your own advantages you can leverage. Mainly your financial freedom (I hope you have more than the average full time traditional student does) and your existing network. The reality of the work is that, despite how involved in the industry some schools are (Emory with the CDC for example), most public health practice takes place outside of the schools. Use connections you make during your time at the health department to connect you to their contacts in the federal realm. I guarantee that someone at the health department oversees some program that receives federal funding. That program will then be overseen by a federal employee at the CDC. Use that connection to find contacts in the fields that you want to be involved in. This is all using your current network and is probably something a student could do as well, the real advantage you have is the money from a full time job. Leveraging that advantage isn’t as easy but may be more rewarding. Use your newfound federal contacts to identify conference and meetings around the country and use your vacation days to attend those. In that environment, although it isn’t as facilitated and easy as school events, you can really make some good contacts. Poster sessions are the best places to make a contact. Keep the contact info for any posters or presentations you are really interested in and follow up with them after the conference. As your network grows through those conferences you can identify even more meetings and conferences to attend and it just snowballs from there. 

If you are a savvy networker then you might build much more meaningful connections this way versus at school networking events. Many of the professionals attending school events sort of already have their guard up or are looking for a specific student for a project. At conferences the environment is much more conducive to what I like to call professional networking versus academic networking. "
publichealth,That kinda just sounds like an epi phd
publichealth,"I plan on going just not sure if i should seek an entry level job first or just jump into grad school. "
publichealth,the lesser evil being epi or behavioral sciences?
publichealth,"In my field, biostatisticians have a PhD. MPH specializations etc. would be data analysts. Your plan is dependent on what your current knowledge is and what you plan to do as a biostatistician. If you're interested only in clinical trials, self-study and helping your office biostatistician may be sufficient. If you want to learn more about psychometrics, bootstrapping/MCMC, machine learning, and the cutting edge of the field, you may want to look into further schooling."
publichealth,"I finished my BS in public health back in December and jumped right into an MPH in epi. Got an internship with the health department near my campus and taking a GIS course ��. I found lots of the people I graduated with used the undergrad as a stepping stone for PA or med school. Only one person from my group I walked with ended up going to the same school as me. "
publichealth,What kind of skills did you gain from the case management position? I’m also looking at positions similar to that but I’m not sure if they’ll be relevant to my goals of going into epi.
publichealth,"Also pick up a copy of EpiInfo and look at their meta-analysis tool, it might clarify the difference for you."
publichealth,"Go get the degree get the money. One you get 5 years experience at a job, then take the break! Trust me!"
publichealth,"I did health education and behavioral health... not a big money maker but I like it a lot... epidemiology might be more practical, although I'm not positive."
publichealth,"No problem! I'm working on it, circumstances just weren't right for the traditional college/pre-med path, so I started working as a CRA, honed my skills, was offered better positions as a CRC, and I now have tuition reimbursement. Plus, I love being a CRC.

A bit of unsolicited advice: A lot of 'career' CRCs, who are the type you'll want on long-term protocols and/or as regulatory personnel, (as opposed to gap-year pre-meds, who you'll want for shorter-term protocols or as data entry and lab staff) have non-traditional degrees but years of work experience and are CCRCs."
publichealth,I have one of those! University of Memphis for the win!
publichealth,"Go with the free program, assuming it’s CEPH accredited. I find it hard to believe that a “top 3” school is offering you $80,000 more in value for the same degree. Really, the elite school will probably make applying to jobs easier,  but if you network throughout your MPH program (and you should) you’ll be fine. 10-15 years from now when you’re not still trying to pay off the loans for your MPH, you’ll know you made the right choice."
publichealth,Peace corps volunteer. Health educator now.
publichealth,"Still working on getting to where I want to be! I went the LHD route (currently in MI but locating to Atlanta in a couple of weeks). Took me a stint in the nonprofit industry to develop some communications and partnership building skills post-grad, and then I was lucky enough to land a dream role at our LHD in STD prevention outreach, which I unfortunately have to leave due to my SO’s job. A lot of advice I hear is not to worry about not landing a dream role right out of school. It may take a couple of tries to get to where you want to be. Focus on similar skills in the job PDs that you want to acquire - is it providing education? Capacity building? Strategic planning? (These are just examples, sort of unrelated to policy!) Think about what you want to learn and where you see yourself a few years from now. You may learn a lot of cool things at an unrelated job, or in a field that isn’t exactly your interest. Try to broaden your search and you may surprise yourself. I think your upcoming internship will be great! And a lot of policy experts are needed at the state level. :-)"
publichealth,"You are right, my program didn't require any tracks. It had a big overall picture of public health. So my program's courses included health promotion, health policy, program evaluation, epi/stats - pretty much all the fundamental skills. I'm still not sure if it was a right idea to do a general MPH program, but I definitely learned a lot."
publichealth,Are you graduating before or after the summer internship? Do you have any public health experience besides this upcoming internship?
publichealth,"Just want to agree with the others here that taking the job if it is offered is a great idea. You can gain skills in juggling priorities, project management, etc. that will translate to future work in gov. You may also liaise with city DOH types and gain networking/connections that way. Good luck in the job search!"
publichealth,"I had a really strong resume by the time I finished my MPH, but it took me 6 months to find work. Part of the problem is applying to jobs out of the area you currently live in. Make sure you address wanting to relocate in your resume and cover letter. Once you get a job things shouldn't be so bad, but I would say public health is discouraging to find work in. The field is dominated by young women, which means wages are low and employers often have their eyes open for the ""best deal."" You will find yourself competing with women who have a financial support network and can accept a job that pays $38K for someone with a masters degree \(I don't have a financial support network\)... so it took me 6 months to find a job that would pay me enough to meet my bottom line."
publichealth,"I don't think it's hard to be honest when you sit down and take the time to learn the stuff, and there is no pressure to learn fast or perform for a grade. I do admit for my applied epi class, which was the first time I used SAS, was a nightmare because our professor did not teach it to us who are new and weren't familiar (think it was because it was a five week course and hence it was rushed) and just expected us *know* it for some of the complex things we had to do and she wasn't there all the time to help us, so it was frustrating trying to figure out errors and stuff. After that, I just decided to learn SAS myself and it's been much easier to grasp the content. Thank god for some very valuable lecture on YT!"
publichealth,"That sounds more or less like what I want to end up doing. I'm sure there's something out there that better reflects what I want to be doing. Thanks "
publichealth,"Take the internship, as it will give you some of that experience you need. Also, my advice to you is that if you want free experience, volunteer somewhere remotely related to public health. Even if the duties are light employers like to see that you're putting yourself out there and trying. 

Also, don't get too discouraged \- It's \*always\* tough finding a job right out of school. It may take months or even years but eventually, you'll work yourself to where you want to be. Don't get discouraged when you don't get what you want right away \- it sounds like you're already on the right track :\)"
publichealth,"To my knowledge, most programs have restrictions that would prevent you from attributing credits earned towards an already awarded degree to a new degree.  Even then it would be unusual for an institution to take more than a few courses as transfer credits.    

You've got an MPH.  That's a working degree.  The most cost effective method might be to find employment that involves some data work, learn on the job, and see if you can get them to comp you for additional education hours to expand on that work.  Example: Some universities give free tuition to employees."
publichealth,It's unlikely they would not get accredited if they are currently in process. I would worry more about the lack of PH research and internship opportunities in a new school
publichealth,"First of all, worry less about the impostor syndrome, people mistake a lack of education with a lack of capability. You are taking an active move to put that fear to rest, so to drop a cliche if you are trying to ""be the change you want to see in yourself"" then don't fault yourself for not being there yet. You have to use your own yardstick to measure your success. I also have an MBA, and as I told the few professors I had philosophic differences with ""I didn't take this program thinking the only answer was to put everything up as an offering to the free market."" It can be intimidating, like taking an accounting class and being the only person who isn't already a CPA.  That doesn't mean you can't do the work and get what you want out of it.

Also, along with that advice, I'm going to give you the two best pieces of advice I got before graduate school:

1. Graduate school is as much about knowing what you can safely ignore as much as it is about what you should be studying \(i.e. they'll want you to read a ton, know what you should be reading to help you succeed, rather than what's assigned\). This will really start to make sense half way through.
2. All things being considered equal, most second\-tier schools have largely the same curricula and the same amount of work as a top\-tier school. If you have the opportunity, pick the first\-tier school. When everyone someone is looking at has the same degree, the prestige of the school you go to matters. For example, I could only afford a second\-tier school, and now I work as a consultant, which despite keeping the same clients for years at a time is still like applying for a new job every three to six months. With a second\-tier school, I have to work twice as hard to get the same jobs an ivy league person does.

...and finally, one from my old coach ""you gotta have love, if you have love for something, you may not be the best, but you'll always be a contender, and everyone will see you got that love. If you don't have love, you got nothing."" Good luck!"
publichealth,"thank you for your advice! "
publichealth,"NAU it is there first year. Not even accredited yet. I think they were taking like 20 people "
publichealth,Thank you for the comments!! Maybe I need to think of it AFTER having MPH experience....
publichealth,"Not to mention that corrections health care comes in at ten times the cost of the same care outside the system. This is just what happens when you eviscerate public health infrastructure and make the corrections system the dumping grounds for all of society's problems. That is not to say that lack of public health options cause crime, but when half of most inmates are non-violent drug offenders, and half of those aren't even in for distribution and might be helped by addiction treatment, it's safe to say you might be able to cut innate population by as much as 25% with funded diversion programs."
publichealth,"Me too. Somewhat related I really see Non communicable disease as a misnomer. I mean, we know socially diseases like obesity spread from friend to friend, family member to family member. Our friends and the food they eat or give us can be thought of as a vector of disease. "
publichealth,"I think the reputation is great, it's ranked pretty well. The teaching quality was excellent. Also I feel like I see my professors quoted in the new york times all the time. One of my favorite professors actually did a reddit AMA recently!

For the program itself I feel like it's probably changed a lot since I've graduated. I checked the website recently and it looks like the course requirements and things have all changed. My biggest complaint was that there were too many core classes and it didn't leave much room to take classes that interested me or specialize in anything beyond my concentration. But it looks like they revamped all that. 

Also Boston is a great city to be a student in and I think the job opportunities are much better there and in higher concentration than anywhere else."
publichealth,"Yes! OMG public health nurses for public health departments make so much money, and I don't think they spend very much time in clinic. My finances would be so much better if I were an RN too."
publichealth,"It sounds like you need to do some meditation this weekend and decide what you want the most. While we redditers love giving input, it's nearly impossible to help with a decision when the options are all so different. 

Choose what you feel will make you the happiest and don't look back. :\)"
publichealth,"it's an expensive program but i think there are some outside scholarships. i believe apha is willing to subsidize seven thousand dollars for mph@gw students: https://www.apha.org/membership/special-member-savings

so that's a start. i pushed them for financial aid a lot before i joined and in the end had to look for a lot of outside scholarships using google"
publichealth,"To my understanding, at the federal level (OSHA/MSHA and to an extent NIOSH), it's due to a combination of retirement and hiring freeze. Many people who have worked for OSHA since its early days are at retirement age and due to a current hiring freeze for the Department of Labor, those retirees aren't getting replaced. There have been proposed budget cuts to OSHA and MSHA, but I think that's a secondary contributor.

In terms of my state agency, it's hard to say. There have been budget cuts, but it's funded differently than most other state agencies. It's funded by the state workers compensation fund, so companies pay into their workers compensation insurance and that funds the agency, who in turn provides free EHS services to companies (within reason). There has been some ""oh this person left for private sector/retired/whatever but we won't be replacing them"" going on, but I can't say how much that's contributing either. My understanding isn't so much that it's budget cuts as it's budget reallocation -- they're directing more money to their services and general overhead costs."
publichealth,"If you for sure want to do an MPH in the US I wouldn’t get a MPH from a different school abroad. If you are talking about a PhD at Hopkins that changes things. Go with option 1. It’s cheaper and you said you’ll get more experience which is key. As an American, I’ve never heard of either school so name brand doesn’t mean much to me. "
publichealth,"Yeah, I've got a year and a half until I graduate. I know there's a lot of openings for it, but I'm unsure if I'll actually enjoy it. That's rare in itself; to actually like your job. I don't know, it just seems like a lot of pressure and I feel like I'm not learning anything, but I'm sure that's everyone else too. 

I know I'd probably just work for Cerner or something, implementing their solutions in hospitals and private practices or whatever. I can't really do research since I won't have a master's degree. Can't teach since I'm not getting a PhD, even though I'd love that. Tenured, doing whatever you want, summers off, making bank.

I'm a bit lost, but who knows what's gonna happen anyway, right?"
publichealth,"I’m interested in learning more about what exactly this study is! What’re your goals/hypotheses/etc? What are you trying to find here? 
I just graduated with my Masters in Community Health, I specifically am interested in research. I’ve been a research coordinator for my advisor’s study these past 2 years. "
publichealth,"Finding the right job can be tricky. You might get lucky the first try, or it might take you a while. Pay attention to cues from bosses during interviews. Not everyone has a choice, but if you do, try to work with someone you really like and respect and who cares about your success. It makes a big difference.  You'll find your way."

publichealth,"Current MPH (Health Policy and Law) student. I'm in Boston so there's a ridiculous amount of private healthcare orgs, hospitals, etc around so many of my friends have found jobs/internships working for them. Data is always big but healthcare mgmt/policy is huge right now - especially in opioids, maternal and child health, guns, and our current administration. 
I agree with u/SadBreath, everyone in my program come from a variety of different backgrounds and there aren't really many people with Bachelor's in Public Health. "
publichealth,It’s garbage degree. Doesn’t pay back w/o an MPH for all those wondering.
publichealth,"Most programs don’t have a GRE requirement if online. University or Arizona, George Washington, Texas just some off the top of my head "
publichealth,"With your stats, you'd likely have a good chance of getting into top programs-- so I can't imagine you wouldn't get in to a state school that's not in the top 20! Admissions data is hard to come by for public health programs (often because it's so high and they don't want to devalue their prestige)-- have you considered just emailing the admissions office?

Is this the only place you're applying to?"
publichealth,"Hahaha. Well, I'll be over to the UK before too long so I'll hear all the words myself. #Prep"
publichealth,"I can type up a detailed post, but I just wanted to throw in that EIS is FAR from ""top level"" Epi work. It's a prestigious program, to be sure, but I've met far too many skilled clinicians in the EIS program with an astoundingly poor grasp of basic epi and biostats. The successful ones usually have an MPH in addition to the MD, or are PhDs in a public health field.

Also, note that EIS is really just a post-doc. You don't work in EIS. You do two years of service and then usually find a job within the CDC, etc. You can also do other programs/fellowships like CSTE or ORISE, which can be done post Master's without a PhD or MD."
publichealth,"Hey there, I got accepted into Columbia's MPH program and will be starting this fall. I got degrees in Biology and Anthropology, which isn't directly public health-related, but I think I did a great job explaining how these fields can relate through certain public health issues. My science GPA was not even over 3.0.... They overlooked this though due to my undergrad math course grades (all As, B+s) and GRE quant score (above 60 percentile). I wouldn't spend money on a post-bacc program unless you really want to or are really concerned, since Columbia is very expensive."
publichealth,I would be interested in reading the entire study. Do you happen to have a link to it?
publichealth,"Thanks for the unsolicited advice, I'd have solicited it had I known that all of these C related acronyms existed as career choices. 
I went from undergraduate to Research Assistant but that didn't involve participant contact, only data and instrument development. When I need people to help with research I typically look for students but I'm probably biased because of the path I took to get where I am. For instance I've never performed a study visit on a study participant but I've designed study visit outlines and then worked with the PRA to ensure that the visit works logistically. The study this thread is about has to collect home sleep tests and setting up a participant to do that requires them coming to the clinic and getting EEG leads placed on their heads (and then returning the device in the morning). As PI I work with the PRA to understand the protocol and they tell me what their schedule has to be in order to make that happen. As long as the data are flowing and of high quality my needs are being met and the PRA has all the flexibility they need.  
Again, thanks for the unsolicited advice and I'll ensure that the next job we post includes CRA/CRC/CCRC in the qualifications."
publichealth,"I don't think every job cares about accreditation, but having been on hiring committees for MPHs, it's not the type of question that gets asked of an applicant. If a hiring committee cares about it, they'll either know off the bat (there aren't hundreds of CEPH accredited schools or anything) or if they aren't sure, they can (and will) very easily look it up. 

I've found that institutional prestige can fairly easily make up for lack of accreditation though, particularly if you're applying to jobs that are geographically nearby that institution."
publichealth,"OHHHHH sorry I misread your question: they don't have a separate school of public health, it's under their school of sciences. "
publichealth,"Interesting! What did you switch to? I don't want to be a hospital administrator, so that aspect has less impact on me :)"
publichealth,"This is a dream job, but I don't meet qualifications... unless you're looking for someone who worked in an Ivy, now for an Ivy-affiliated peds hospital, with about 5 years experience general clinical research and 2 in regulatory and am working on my CCRP in the fall - BUT no BA. :-/ 

I wish you the best of luck in finding a quality coordinator. "
publichealth,"Where do you go? Wish I went here instead of my school, my MPH is impossible..."
publichealth,"Thanks for the response.  I think ""pure IH"" was a poor choice of words on my part, by that I meant doing tasks that are listed by ABIH as counting for IH.

publichealth,"I got a 50% scholarship (+ 12k work study and 2k towards practicum expenses) to Emory for global epi with mostly biomedical research experience. However, my personal statement was very passionate and personalized to them. I think you'd be a great scholarship candidate for many programs-- make sure to just spend time on each application and apply to a few of your top choices to see what the financial situation looks like. :) Feel free to reach out while applying next year and I can hopefully give you more info on Emory if you want!"

publichealth,"I am also enrolled in the UNE program and will be graduating before the CEPH accreditation is re-evaluated. I have taken two courses each 8 week term and I work full time, and I am still handling it all really well. You are given a student support specialist when you start the program who is (at least in my case) very helpful. Good luck with your decision!"
publichealth,"I sent about 200 applications and got 5 or 6 interviews. The job I got barely pays the rent. But I live in an area with a competitive market and a high cost of living. If you're willing to relocate to a big city it wouldn't take that long. "
publichealth,"In general, public health is a post-professional degree, recent undergraduates lack the knowledge base for most public health roles. Put in the position of a hiring manager, I would not consider anyone without at least an MPH.

If you want to pursue a public health career, you will need the MPH or comparable degree. Many MPH programs are online or part-time if you hope to be employed at the same time, though full-time MPHs offer research assistantships which will help further your career."
publichealth,"I'd recommend the CAPM for project management. Someone already said PMP, but that can take up to three years experience. The CAPM is the precursor, and it still has weight. It's achievable in a couple of months. "
publichealth,"I liked it well beforehand because it intersects on a lot of academic interests for me, but what sealed the deal was actually having Lyme disease and getting pissed the hell off at the healthcare system."
publichealth,"Just a guess, but all those MS/MAs could be much better at all the soft skills needed to head up a program. It’s a lot easier to teach the stages of change than how to manage staff and attract clients. Also MSs can be in Health Promotion too! :)"
publichealth,"That's tough. The value of an in class, on campus program is the networking. They often host networking events, guest speakers, and plenty of social activities. You just don't get that with a distance program. Use other forums instead, such as local chapter conferences. "
publichealth,"""Students in the School\-wide MPH program have at least two years of full\-time, post\-baccalaureate, health\-related work experience OR a doctoral degree in a field underlying public health. Applicants in the process of gaining experience can apply before they have reached the two\-year mark, as long as the requirement is fulfilled by the time of matriculation.""\-\-This is directly from Hopkins' MPH admissions requirements. 

Their MSPH/MHA/MHS programs don't require the 2 years post\-bacc experience."
publichealth,"Yeah! No problem. I love online education... I'll be going in person for my phd if I do one, but masters is totally fine online. I was able to travel many times during my studies. A bit slower, but I could do it! "
publichealth,"It does happen, though PhD programs prefer applicants with research or work experience. Students who successfully transition without a gap year usually have a faculty advisor who is in their corner and already have a funded position in a research project which will be their thesis. Otherwise, it is not unusual to take a gap year and work as a project coordinator/research assistant and apply after one year."
publichealth,"I mean, you can argue *every* industry needs people with MPH degrees. That doesn't mean they'll hire them, though.

Anthropology does this with their graduate students. Just because one lucky son of a gun convinced Microsoft, Boeing, or whatever company their degree was a good fit, it doesn't mean they're hiring those grads left and right."
publichealth,"I was going into a very niche field and was very selective (and had enough tutoring clients to keep me afloat) so I only applied to 10-15 jobs, got 3 interviews, and ended up getting a job that I hadn't applied for at a place I had interviewed at. Started as a temp to replace someone who departed (since I could literally start the next day and work under her until she left) and was converted to permanent after a few months."
publichealth,Try JHUs data science course on Coursera
publichealth,"So far this is the one that looks really good to me. I would love to hear about your experience. "
publichealth,"Whatever you end up doing, take an epi and biostats course if you can."
publichealth,"The Mailman School of Public Health has a good overall reputation. I don't know much about the MPH program specifically or the school's research portfolio, but their changes to their doctorate programs are setting new standards for curriculum and funding for DrPH programs. 

I am not a big fan of Jeffrey Sachs, he's rather self-indulgent and his ideas on sustainable development are imperial. I wouldn't recommend their global health program for that specific reason (if you are comparing two options), though I'm sure the other faculty are fine.

But you should be aware that the experience requirement in many schools is misleading. For example, at JHU about one-third of the MPH class is coming out of undergrad, and another one-third after taking a gap year or in medical school without experience. At GWU those percentages are higher."

publichealth,"[The Chicago School of Professional Psychology](https://www.thechicagoschool.edu/psychology-programs/public-health/) has an online MPH program that doesn’t require a GRE. "
publichealth,"What state are you in, if you don't mind me asking?"
publichealth,"Your best bet is to talk to a few school directly, ideally in person if you can. Generally MPH programs down play the importance of GPA’s in favor for work experience. However a 2.8 is on the low end for a top school like Columbia. Then I started to read your work experience and...damn.... you’ve done a lot of things. That helps you a lot. One thing I can’t tell from your description is how important your role was in each experience, but some of those things sound like legitimately impressive. Public health schools LOVE that. So yes, you do have a chance for a school like Columbia. Take the GRE (get at least a 300, but a score closer to 320 will offset the GPA ), write a good, cohesive essay, and then APPLY. If you never apply I can guarantee that you won’t get in"

publichealth,"apply for phd, most are funded with a stipend. finish all the courses required for a masters, then leave."
publichealth,"Most PhD programs require you to take intro epidemiology classes etc. even if you've already earned your MPH, so you'll get a chance to reacquaint yourself with the material. You won't be jumping straight into the deep end, at least as far as I've heard from admissions directors and faculty at my current school. "
publichealth,"If you're comfortable with taking on the debt, go with JHSPH. The gdec program is very skills based and evolving positively. You can graduate with with very concrete, marketable skills. My first job was essentially because of a method specifically taught at JHSPH; the person hiring was a PhD graduate from JHSPH. 

Important to keep in mind that it's difficult to get a job in any field and global health is super competitive. Job insecurity is real and I've been unemployed during periods or in between projects. During the five years after your master's, salaries are generally in the 50-60k at large global health non profits, but smaller organizations only offered me 30-40k. This can make paying back loans more challenging.

Jhsph has one of the best biostats programs. The gdec curriculum is rigorous and aggressive, but motivated students can fit in classes so if you were to come to jhsph, I'd recommend complementing your general courses with biostats classes, like R. You'll be extremely marketable as a data scientist (even in tech) and won't be restricted to global health jobs. "
publichealth,Heck you might be able to log in to your old account ;)
publichealth,Your chances look very good.  What is your overall goal?  Is an MPH a better fit for your interests?
publichealth,"Yeah, I’m definitely not in the field and thanks for correcting my misconceptions. 

From what you said, I feel like I might not have had a good intro. What could I look into to expand my understanding?"
publichealth,"Hello, thank you for your response! I’m not exactly sure about what kind of PhD I would like to do, but I am interested in chronic conditions in certain minority groups, so it would be something with that. When you say little to no quantitative data analysis, do you mean nothing beyond a basic epi course?"
publichealth,"Just a thought, if you're filling out automated applications and you cannot select that you have an MPH in hand, even if you try to type it in a comment box somewhere that you will graduate soon, the system will automatically kick you off the list of potential applicants, that is if an MPH is listed in the job description as a requirement.   This would be true for other questions on the application as well.  Also, do you have field experience to accompany your MPH?"
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,They do offer opportunities for that in both! Thank you :)
publichealth,"The epidemiology position was entry-level as an epidemiology specialist and I did have prior public health experience, which helped. I'd rather not say where I did my masters online since it's a small program...but there are plenty of good online options nowadays. Try looking for entry-level epi positions at some of the smaller county health departments to get some experience. "
publichealth,"A lot of online Mph programs required a GRE. I’ve looked into probably 20 different programs. I will probably apply to UNE for this fall semester - it seems to be pretty flexible with timing, affordable, doesn’t require a GRE, and has a deadline that fits my schedule. 

I was/am also considering East Tennessee state university, Univ of Florida, Univ of South Florida, and University of Nebraska. Some of the colleges have a GRE waiver so look into that too. Depending on your speciality and experience there might be other schools too. 

For other responders - is the CEPH accreditation important for getting a job? I didn’t know UNE was on probation. That does give me pause or at least an impetus to research more. "
publichealth,"I mean, not the best if you don't learn on your own, but a lot of analyses you can practice and learn on your own. A dataset like NHANES is available easiy; I learned a lot from attempting to recreate a paper's analysis and then trying some of your own. Not formal (I agree with the other person who said do a certificate), but at least it gives you practice. "
publichealth,A US Ebola outbreak would be a rotten cherry on top of the dumpster fire that is this administration.
publichealth,"Generally speaking you can always conduct a systematic review but not always a meta-analysis. You can’t really set out to do a meta analysis. The analysis comes after the systematic review part so if you don’t have enough studies or appropriate results from the studies then it can be hard to conduct the meta analysis. That being said, meta analysis would be preferred I think since all meta analysis is systematic review but not all systematic review is meta analysis. It’s sort of a step beyond. "
publichealth,Behavioral for sure
publichealth,"I think there's a lot of potential in blending those two skillsets. Historically, public health doesn't attract the most technologically-adept workforce, so if you develop the right informatics skills you can really start to stand out. I would caution you because many health informatics programs have a strong focus on hospitals and other clinical settings that might not have a direct application to the public health context. It would still be possible to apply your skills in settings like a health department or public health NGO, but it just wouldn't be as straightforward as if you found a program with a public health focus."
publichealth,"I’m set on moving to Atlanta, but as someone who has no financial support I would be very stressed about signing a new lease and moving without having a job first. I’ve heard that Emory especially drags their feet when it comes to calling applicants for interviews, so I’m hoping that’s just what the case is right now. 

I’ve set up my resume so that employers know when my ideal moving date would be. Lately I’ve also been writing that I’m just planning to relocate upon hire. We won’t be living together there so Im not sure if it would be falsifying information if I used my boyfriend’s address once he has secured housing, if I’m still not getting call backs by the time he moves?

In general I’m not in a hurry, I would just really like to avoid having a long distance relationship for longer than I need to so the earlier I get a job the better. "
publichealth,"Honestly, I think the major skills I developed during my relatively short time as a case manager were cultural sensitivity, conflict resolution, and political savvy. I would recommend searching for a different job if you would like something more related to epidemiology, unless you’re interested in working with a particular population or something."

publichealth,"I got my MPH at CUNY as well. I am more interested in policy/management than stats and enjoyed the HPM track. I think there are more career and publication opportunities in Epi -- working with large data sets is a useful skill. One option is to register for HPM and make sure to take Intro to Statistics in the first semester. If you love it, switch to the Epi track. Core courses at CUNY are sometimes hard to get into, but if you write emails to advisors and professors, they can probably find a spot for you in the stats class this fall. I think switching tracks from HPM to Epi is not too hard to do, but I am not sure. "
publichealth,What is your opinion on a bs in health informatics and then a masters in public health degree?
publichealth,"I like the broadness of it. As of now I’m writing about my childhood growing up in populated CA and rural Montana. And the health issues present via environmental concerns. IE pollution in Cali. Mercury levels in river in MT. How two vastly different ecosystems are tied together through One Health. And why the discipline of One Health is important. "
publichealth,"Not law because I wouldn't want to do the work of a lawyer. The biggest draw for me would be lobbying, and I understand that it totally is possible for me to do that without having to appear in court. I'm just exploring my options too, law school isn't totally off the table. 

I'm okay with moving. I feel confident that once I get a masters, I'll be able to find something to do."

publichealth,"I'd start by seeing if your state or city has a public health association.  Most states have one, and it's usually a pretty good resource for local jobs (depending on how active the organization is).

I've also found that https://apps.sph.emory.edu/PHEC/ is a great resource.  Also look at CSTE, NACCHO, American Association for Cancer Research, American College of Epidemiology, American Public Health Association, American Society for Preventive Oncology (ASPO), American Statistical Association (ASA), Section on Statistics in Epidemiology (SIE), and the Society for Epidemiological Research (SER).  They all run job boards of one type or another, and many organizations post jobs on their sites.

I'm usually great at finding stuff like this but searching on google for rehs inurl:.pdf and similar searches is coming up with nothing.

Thanks in advance for any help."
publichealth,"Maybe you can apply and then go elsewhere if they don't get their accreditation? I honestly have no idea how much it would matter... no one asked me if my alma mater was accredited \(although it was\) while I was applying for jobs, but if you want to get a PhD this would most likely hold you back... and like I said, I'm not positive it wouldn't hurt you while applying for jobs. "
publichealth,"Are you looking for opinions on what you should do? For me, it would come down to cost/benefit analysis. A poster presentation (is this for a conference?) using only secondary data is pretty low yield, so I would let it go. 

If you feel like it's something you want to fight for, either contact her or your former boss directly and let them know you would like credit for your work. 

Unfortunately, this is not uncommon at all. There are a ton of people who contribute to papers/studies who are not included or even approached when publishing. In my experience, it's usually due to poor communication, and it's awkward to address. My personal criteria is to address the issue directly if any of the following are true: 

* It is not a descriptive study, and I helped develop the hypothesis 
* I participated in study design and data collection of primary data
* I conducted analysis and wrote up the interpretation for non-descriptive studies"
publichealth,Are you in the US? did you submit FAFSA?
publichealth,"Yup, an intro epi course is required for the program either way. Biostats is obviously required for epi and optional for HPM. Thanks for the tip!"
publichealth,"&gt;I thought that price was not worth it either, but it seems like that is how much typical MPH programs cost.  Surprisingly, if you include cost of living, US programs run more expensive than the European programs I've been looking at, but maybe I've just completely missed the good (but cheap) programs in the US.

Which programs? Are you only looking at ""top tier"" programs? Why not state schools? MPH programs aren't entirely standardized, but the curriculum you will take is pretty similar between most schools that it does not warrant going in the hole $60-120k more.

The program I am in is $11.5k for a year. While it isn't as prestigious, I know I am going to be coming out with a similar, if not identical, skill set. Networking is more important than name recognition. My rent is $300 and my utilities are approximately $65ish. It is nowhere close to the numbers you're throwing out and it's in a top 20 city.

&gt;Mind you I also feel confident in getting some sort of tuition assistance, and seeing as I am making 32k/year now and most jobs I've seen that required a MPH start at 45-50k/year, I think that 2 years of 30-50k in debt pays off within 3-6 years and the rest is profit.  I do think its doable to get into one of the cheaper 60k programs.

While you likely will get some financial assistance, you can't guarantee it. Also, having graduated and working in the real world for several years before going back, I think you may be more optimistic than what the actual job field is like. You have a good background and I do think you'll be competitive, but I think the salary expectation is off the mark.

The idea of being able to pay those loans at those prices back that fast is idealistic at best.

&gt;And most positions that I am currently eligible for in the Peace Corps are volunteer positions or they are in fields of study that don't interest me as much, and seem to be geared more towards getting into a Masters program.  I'm less worried about getting in, and more worried about paying for and finding a job after, so paying extra to get better connections might be worth it.

That's fair, but keep in mind Peace Corps has benefits beyond that including scholarships, preferential treatment at certain top tier programs, and a foot in the door for federal government jobs."
publichealth,"I really want to travel, I have two hangups about it (besides just being terrified):

* A year is a long time. Especially since I have a vague plan of what I'd be doing. I'm assuming you got into the Spanish government program to teach English correct?
* I'll have a three year gap of not working: year off + 2 years for Master degree. That's a long time and I'll be 29 by then. I'll also be broke as I'm sure my money will not make it that far, or just barely.

I'm probably just trying to make excuses for myself "
publichealth,"And FWIW I switched my address just a couple weeks ago and have already gotten three interview offers after six weeks of silence. We have an apartment so I stated that we will be relocating there to that address at the end of the month. Not sure if it’s a reliable strategy, but I think that has aided me slightly. "

publichealth,"Hi! I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Biostat and, while I can't give much info about the job outlook, I can tell you that you seem pretty well versed. Depending on where you apply, I think what stands out the most is the personal statement, letters of recommendation, and your past work. (GRE's are important too, but grad programs like people, not scores imo.)

I started my undergrad career as a premed, and ended with a BS in Public Health with a strong statistics background. The genetics work is HUGE for biostats, and I'm sure you can find some courses that coincide with your interests!

Where are you thinking of applying?"
publichealth,"Virtually no MPH programs are CAHME accredited. Like 4 total. That shouldn’t be a metric you use to make such a big decision.

edit: To be clear, all MPH programs should be CEPH accredited and you wouldn't want to go to an unaccredited program."
publichealth,"All the authors of that paper, with the exception of the representative from APHA, represent schools that have stronger domestic public health programs. Seems inherently biased."
publichealth,"Nursing is patient oriented. Where as public health is population oriented. Nursing would certainly be very hands on and offers great job security, but I’ve heard nurses having a tough time working in hospitals and medical offices, with doctors pushing the hard slog down... also many years of studying and if u want to switch to pub health u will need to study more. 
I’d say if money is not an issue go for it but if u just want to get into diabetes management, a nursing degree is not necessary. "

publichealth,"Did you hear back for an interview yet? I'm in the same boat but first year MPH. The process is pretty opaque and frustrating "
publichealth,"I don't suggest AmeriCorps; they are notorious for taking on unfunded programs and grant mismanagement, which sometimes results in you worrying how to pay your rent while  you are figuring out how to make the world a healthier place. If you want to become a public health educator, it may help to get some experience in public health. There's plenty of causes out there that need help, just find an organization that does something you believe in, be humble since you are an unknown to them, work yourself into and up in the administration of that program and exit with some glowing references and an exceptional job title \(oh, and very little to no pay, but at least you made the world a better place\). That was my approach early in my career, and it worked for me."
publichealth,"Funny story, so originally my plan was to get a Masters. And I was a masters student for a year. The spring of that year, one of my professors (who is now my advisor) basically convinced me to change to a PhD. He said that I would be well suited for the PhD program, and that if I was considering getting a PhD I should do it right away rather than wait. His reasoning was that it would be hard to come back to school after the Masters and working in the field. Also I really had no clue what type of work I wanted to do, so a PhD was a way for me to figure things out while also learning. 

As for choosing programs, look into the faculty at each school and see if there is anyone in particular you'd like to work with. Reach out to them and tell them about your interests and such. It's good to know people and network!"
publichealth,"Dont limit yourself. Apply to schools you want to go to, and have some reach schools. Grad School is not like undergrad, your scores dont matter as much. Talk to admissions and department heads at programs that interest you. Ask questions about your research interests, etc. Network before applying. Chances are those people will be on the committee looking at your app in December and January. 

EHS is smaller and often less competitive than other EHS fields. Just because a school may seem competitive, does not mean that their EHS programs are strict. 

Again, talk to admissions and faculty at programs that interest you (and not just programs that YOU think you can get into, but programs that you would like to attend). That can go a long way. 

You can explain any extenuating circumstances in your SOPHAS and i suggest you do that as well. "
publichealth,"Oh, super interesting. I just listened to yesterday's (April 2nd) NY Times The Daily podcast- just a snippet on what's going on in prison reform, or what's not going on, in the US.

publichealth,"Just an FYI, I've just graduated from the University of New England and we learned both STATA and SAS (one during epi and one during biostats, though I don't remember which went with which...). There are also further classes in applied epidemiology and infectious disease epi. I've been job hunting and none of the epi jobs I've looked at required a specific degree in epidemiology, if specific experience was required it was 3 classes worth so you'd be fine if you took the electives. So if the other stuff doesn't work out it may be worth reconsidering. "

publichealth,"Find a job that fits your interests.  I think it is important to put your interests in front of money right now.  If you can get into a consulting job, it will give you exposure to many topics.  Also, you may want to work for a few years before you go to graduate school for MPH. Your job experience will help you refine your goals."
publichealth,"If the question were small state school versus Yale, then Yale. But UCLA, Cal and Yale? Then go with UCLA or Cal and save yourself an extra $30k. If Yale wants you that badly, they can have you for a funded PhD."
publichealth,"I would never refer to business operations at a hospital, LTC, nursing home, etc. as a ""clinical setting"" so it confused me and I thought you wanted to work with patients, which doesn't align with getting an MHA."

Of course I’m only in Undergrad and am going off of what I have read and heard. If you have more insight into the differences that would be great to hear!"
publichealth,"Without pointing fingers, neither of those. There are some specific PH departments in the Commonwealth I would not want to work for again. I'm just saying, do your homework and ask around before accepting a job. You don't want to be in any organization where good money is chasing bad projects."

publichealth,"I went to Rutgers in New Brunswick. To clarify, I'm not saying school was easy necessarily, but most of the students at Rutgers work full time, and almost all classes are at night.

publichealth,Oh wow. How did you find the job? Was it through networking/knowing someone in the industry? I'm just wondering because it's not really talked about compared to other jobs in the public health field.
publichealth,"Its the first option - I want to work as a biostatistician. Do you think it would be enough for an employer that I would have the biostatistics coursework, even though I won't have the MPH specifically in Biostatistics credential? "

publichealth,Yupper!!
publichealth,"People get MPHs with a variety of BA/BS majors. Your knowledge of political science could help you with certain aspects of health policy and your knowledge of Spanish could help you if you choose to work in Global Health or with domestic immigrant populations.

There are over 3,000 counties in the USA. Most of them are rural, and most rural areas have trouble recruiting masters-level employees. If you are a reasonably hard worker and willing to relocate to an underserved community, you will most likely be able to find public health employment. But finding entry level work in urban areas can be extremely difficult.

It's always hard to predict hiring trends in public health. 10 years ago nobody was saying ""opioid overdose is going to be the next big thing"" yet here we are. The key is flexibility. I'm of the opinion that public health needs more interdisciplinary workers who blend traditional public health subject areas with outside skills like IT, communication, logistics, etc. With the right blend of skills you can really carve out a niche for yourself. "
publichealth,"The MPH concentration doesn’t matter as much as your skill set, the types of stats programs you know how to use, and your experience. Look into online classes in biostats to broaden your skills and get as much experience using those skills on your resume as possible."

publichealth,"No real experience, but I had a STEM undergrad so I was able to rise quickly on back of my prior skillset. I started interning while getting my MPH, and was hired before I finished. My recommendation would be to apply to your target grad school even if you don't think you have the experience, the minimum experience requirements are flexible. If you don't get in where you want, look for jobs in grassroots or research organizations and reapply"
publichealth,"I don't mind standby. Sometimes it's annoying, because maybe 10-15% of the time I don't make the flight, or don't make several flights. BUT it's great cause of the price and the flexbility- flying last minute when I want is the best thing on earth. "
publichealth,"One thing to think about\-\- most scholarships are awarded for the fall semester and, with your experience, you're a great candidate. Many of the prestigious places with global health programs also only allow enrollment in the fall semester. If I were you, I'd wait a few months to start in fall since it will likely be better for your career in the long\-run. :\)"
publichealth,"Is the degree not accredited, or just the school? Because CEPH will accredit MPH degree programs even if the college hasn't been accredited yet."
publichealth,"Your information about The MPH program at JHU isn’t true. Hopkins requires 2 years of work experience to get accepted into the MPH program. As far as I know they do not make exceptions to this rule. Hopkins also has a MSPH program that does not have the 2 year work requirement. "
publichealth,"That means waiting 11 years to do something I've been wanting to do for a while, doesn't that seem a little excessive? I'll be 33 years old. Definitely not old, but not exactly young...

* undergrad 4 years
* working 4 years
* master degree 2 years
* working 5 years"
publichealth,"I was in the same boat years ago. I just emailed a bunch of places and asked. I got a January start in the MS environmental health program at Iowa. "
publichealth,"Hey /u/WardenCommCousland thanks for your feedback!! 
If you can disclose, what types of reports are you writing? How technical do you get with the hard sciences? How are they structured? 
Did you start out in a consulting group or somewhere else? Thanks again! "
publichealth,"true, thanks for the tip!! "
publichealth,"There are multiple urban planners in my MPH program, and graduate level dual degrees in urban planning and public health are common. I think you'll be set up just fine to get into MPH programs."
publichealth,Ooooh ty
publichealth,"I have a pop health PhD.  its a bit more epi focused, however it is what you make it and can vary by school.  Look at the required coursework to see what you will be trained in and most of it is based on who is your advisor and what type of research you are doing. PhD is more research focused than coursework and your PhD research will define you post-PhD

In my experience it is mainly focused on an interdisciplinary approach to clinical research, but it is typically flexible. "
publichealth,"This. Do the free MPH program, make the most of it by networking with professors and seeking out research opportunities, and then get paid to go to a top school for your PhD. "
publichealth,"Try taking a public health class or two if you can and see if you like it. You can always pick it up as a minor or switch it entirely later on. "
publichealth,"Oh boy, it can get a little wild. I live in an area with a lot of anti government sentiment and tons of 'experts' on things like chem trails, radio frequency stuff, fluoride, etc. Look up Bo Gritz, he had a compound here, so we still have some of his followers.

I don't do the whole Facebook deal so I interact with these folks in person, generally we come to the quick conclusion that neither of us will change the others mind. There is something about leading a horse to water... What ever you do don't be condescending, some people can take offense if you shove a bunch of citations in their face, it come accross as 'look how smart I am and your dumb.'"
publichealth,"I used a tuition remission program to pay for 90% of my MPH and I had 8 years of work experience when I started the program. I wouldn't have been able to do either of those things without having the benefit of work experience, and I would not have had a specific focus within public health and social/behavioral sciences if I did not spend time working and learning about my strengths and interests. I would suggest that you work for a couple of years to figure out what kind of MPH you want and what skills you seek to gain as you can do so much with an MPH. I would look at research coordinator roles or entry level roles in policy, community health, or whatever is of interest. It sounds like you have a variety of volunteer/internship experiences so use those to help you identify what to pursue at this point. "
publichealth,I work at a medical school and health informatcists have some good job options. A lot of health systems are trying to figure out how to leverage big data to improve their clinical outcomes.
publichealth,"Thank you! "
publichealth,"I just have my B.S. in public health but I’ve been considering going to nursing school! You can also look at the public health nursing side. I know in my state every public health job listing seems to also required a bachelors of nursing so if anything it might open more doors for you! "
publichealth,"Fair enough. I only have experience with STATA and that requires you to pay for licensing.

Maybe a quick fiddle with R for free can at least get you some exposure to the type of program you’ll be working with."
publichealth,"Okay well first of all do not even bother with non accredited . Second , you might need to wokr on your application - I applied to suny Albany , almost directly from undergrad in Econ / math with like a 3.01 from the last school, and like 3.5 overall but with 31 Withdraws... not a typo ....  you need to just apply to a variety of schools . 

I had 0 public health experience . I was a stay at home mom at that point. I had one old internship in management consulting and a job working for health insurance like 5 years before applying "
publichealth,"I don't think an accredited school of public health can offer a non-accredited MPH degree, can they?  Either way, I wouldn't attend a program if the degree isn't accredited."
publichealth,Money is better than my undergraduate major.
publichealth,Yes! I wish I had read this list before I started my MPH.
publichealth,"My best advice is do not take a full course load if you’re not in a rush to finish your degree. Grad school is hard, especially an MPH. I’m in a top 10 program and it’s slowly killing me. Definitely take it slow and don’t overwhelm yourself! "
publichealth,"CIH here. I think several industries and companies are trending towards EHS folks having an IH specialty, and away from the dedicated hygienist. I also don't think the career of being a dedicated hygienist, even in a corporate setting, will ever go away, just might transform a little.

Personally, I worked for a few years as solely an IH in copper mining and smelting, and really truly enjoyed it. I left that role because the company was seeing layoffs and I needed something a little more stable, and changed industries. Now I work in the semiconductor industry and got a foot in the door as an EHS generalist. Over the first year at that company I was able to leverage my IH specialty to get a promotion, become the site IH, and really make an impact on our programs on a global scale. 

Stick with IH as a focus, but don't be afraid to spread yourself out to the broader EHS fields. I know every industry talks about how many baby boomers are on the verge of retiring, and how this will lead to a vacuum in qualified people, and I believe this is especially true with IH. My company has an open senior IH position open in the bay area that has been very difficult to fill. The current IH is retiring and we are having a hard time finding any candidates, let alone qualified ones. That's a long winded way of saying there's a lot of opportunity out there right now."
publichealth,"Thanks everyone for your thoughts. I think that I'd ultimately be closing the door to the type of work I want to do by going to the smaller school \(due to the limits of the type of research they do here\). Even if I can't completely calculate the opportunity cost of the bigger program in terms of potential income increase it would offer, I feel like it opens up the door to the type of work I hope to do in my career. "
publichealth,"Oh yeah - standby flights are brill. "
publichealth,Thanks Obama
publichealth,"I always enjoyed the lab in classes in HS and College (bio, Chem, micro). My grades were always better in the lab portion of my classes."
publichealth,"That's great! The tuition and etc. What is their timeline for accreditation? Even if they do get it in the future, which is not a guarantee, I would never go for a program without CEPH\-accreditaiton. Ever. To me it's a big waste of time. I think it is for most people. 

If they could get it... yes. But who knows when or if?"
publichealth,"Ok sounds good

But seriously, a few follow-ups:
What do you consider as ‘using’ it?
Did an advanced degree not help with the position you currently hold or have held?
Where did you look?
What were some of the reasons given for you not being hired (if they shared them)
"
publichealth,"Great, glad you worked it out. Always good to draw a line in the sand and stick up for yourself and your work."
publichealth,"I know very little about South Africa.  A quick google search put University of Cape Town, University of Witwatersrand, and University of Pretoria as the top Universities in South Africa.  Does that sound about right?  Any others you might recommend checking out?  Just trying to narrow my search as I will likely only apply to 5-6 schools.  Its just overwhelming checking out all schools in another country when I've already looked at US, UK, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Denmark, Sweden, etc..."
publichealth,"Yes and yes. Still got nothing
"
publichealth,"Oh that’s neat I assume you like the work since you’re still there. "
publichealth,What specifically interests you about One Health? It would help to know that.
publichealth,"Congrats! "
publichealth,"As others have mentioned, it is very dependent on your program and school. The most I had in one class was about 32 people - for our intro theory course. Besides that, it was anywhere from 4-20. 
Now, if you are in an MPH with 100 students in a cohort it is going to be very different if you are in one that has an intro cohort of 500."
publichealth,How do you feel about studying part-time while traveling? Does that seem like too much of a commitment? I've read online that it's both doable and not suggested (due to distractions).
publichealth,"This doesn't tell us enough.

What are your career goals? What do you find interesting? Is there a certain amount of money you want to make to be comfortable? What kinds of things to you want and, conversely, not want in your daily work?"
publichealth,"Bias towards MD is institutional across the US government. It's seen as more distinguished and is better known compared to public health which is a newer field. A common complaint amongst CDC employees is how MDs do not make good managers. In general, CDC technocratic to a fault, and many employees get online PhDs etc in order to move up.

If CDC is your ultimate goal, Emory is a great place to go. I don't know about the strength of their Epi program but I'm sure it is solid. The trick is to gain as many hard skills as you can during an MPH, and get the situational knowledge on the job. In other words, if you have to choose between taking a class of Refugee Health or GIS, take the GIS class every time."
publichealth,"This is really useful to know! Thanks for breaking your experience and advice down. "
publichealth,"Sorry, no. Just saw this on on the Johns Hopkins Public Health twitter feed. "
publichealth,I'm going into a general GRE program instead of the Epi program. Is it easy to get into that field without a specialized MPH?
publichealth,Thank you! That seems to be the consensus. Guess I’ll give it’s shit
publichealth,"My concentration was Healthcare Organization and Policy. My Bachelor's is in Accounting. Before this position, I worked in Project Analysis for another large non-profit."
publichealth,"My first job in research after getting a BS in biology and anthropology (1997) was data cleaning and management for a research group in a hospital supporting 15-20 fellows and various grants. I was given an office with a 386 and telnet access to a server with SAS on it. My supervisor was an old stats guy from Yale and his wife who had been a SAS programmer since the 70's (the Cards statement means something to these folks). They gave me a Unix book and pointed me to a folder with ""some SAS programs that work"" and instructions to modify them for a bunch of data files that should be compared and then combined into an analysis dataset. They then left for a two week vacation. 
Oh yeah and there was a room down the hall full of high school students who did data entry for the research experience! 

This was one of the best experiences I ever had and it set me on a course that resulted in an MPH and then a doctorate in epi many years later. Those basic data entry, cleaning and management skills are extremely valuable because down the road when you're working with datasets that you're given by others you'll be able to evaluate the quality of the data in an experienced way. It really does help you as a researcher later on. When I'm creating capstone and practicum projects for MPH/MS students I always include some data entry tool creation, data entry into the tool and data cleaning in the mix. A practicum might start with a big pile of paper forms filled out by a population making the first job for the student a philosophical one; how do I turn this information into data? Then chuck in some double data entry, QC and cross tabs and you have the basis for a capstone proposal, right? I just did this as a field methods project, the student kicked ass, went from paper to tables (via Redcap) in a couple of months and the data are so interesting that we have abstracts out to editors to gauge interest for publication. 

It all starts with data experience as you said, pubmed search the closest academic/teaching hospital and see who's publishing consistently, go there and talk with them. If there's a research requirement for their fellows then supporting that work will teach you all sorts of interesting things! Good luck! "

publichealth,"I dislike how tuition works in the US, too! :-)

If you don't want to learn via distance, that's fine; just note that if you were to study that way (note that Imperial College London is also starting up a distance MPH next year), you could literally live anywhere in the world with an Internet connection.

If you want to keep your options open throughout life, your preferred option should be to get the best degree from the best school you can. Take a look at that list of QS rankings for life sciences schools and look at the entries in the top 20 that *aren't* in the US or continental Europe: Cambridge, Oxford, Karolinska, UCL, ICL, Toronto, Melbourne, Sydney, Edinburgh, KCL. Any of those would be a real change of pace for you and would be a prestigious degree. If you walked away from one of them with an MPH, you could then choose where you want to work—whether that's India or anywhere else. Your skills would be recognized and in demand.

Happy to go into more detail in PM than I'm willing to here. Feel free to message me if you'd like. Can tell you more about my school."
publichealth,"Keep talking with professors. Talk to your student services manager to see if there are any internal jobs boards at your school. You're probably SOL given that the semester is mostly over, but things should probably come up over the summer or the start of the fall semester. University research lives on graduate student work."
publichealth,"There is no formula for that. It’s all dependent on you and your personal tolerance for debt. It sounds like you don’t have any from undergrad, which is great. You want federal loans (you should have completed a FAFSA application) because they have they best interest rates and repayment terms/options."
publichealth,"I'm considering applying to Rutgers for my PhD. If you've interacted with any PhD students, do they seem happy? Or do you enjoy the school there otherwise?"
publichealth,"Very true! We recently had to do class introductions and another student mentioned working in similar programming for Latino health. I will definitely reach out to them. Thanks! "
publichealth,Really appreciate this post. Do you have any suggestions/tips for getting scholarships?
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,Once I get five years of experience in the public health sector I'm going to apply to Yale. I don't think Harvard requires experience nor does brown. I keep getting ads for these two. Honestly though the college I go to is ranked right under Yale and is easy to get into. USF is ranked 16. You could start an NGO. Write an a public health app. There are all sorts of things you can do. What Ivy League school do you go to? Their college of Public Health might be willing to provide you with opportunities in the workforce or volunteer experience. Maybe your Ivy League school has a professor that's looking for students to develop Public Health software and design drones such as at USF.
publichealth,"Agreed, and I think now more than ever — and particularly with information around health and science. The news cycle is unrelenting, and the headline is, sadly, where much of the message starts and ends. "
publichealth,"I think you’re taking it the wrong way. I think it just means they are looking for a combination of education OR work experience. If someone graduated with a bachelors and then has worked for the past 2 years as research assistant in the real world, but you went straight for the mph after undergrad and 0 work experience, you’re equally qualified. 

If you have years of work experience AND an MPH - don’t apply for this job. It’s below your pay grade. "
publichealth,"Thank you for sharing your experience, this is very helpful. What is the internship like? "
publichealth,"I think BU has a spring start option (at least it did when I was applying). "
publichealth,"Microbiologist in a state lab after I got my BS. I’m an epi now and will graduate in a few weeks with my online MPH. "
publichealth,"PMP is the most widely recognized project management certification. You need to be already working in the field and have accumulated enough hours of project management experience to sit for the course and exam, but it's not supposed to be too difficult for people who are already working in project management (formally or informally)."
publichealth,I'm in the same boat as you. I've been told that it's best for us to go to grad school first because jobs aren't really that available in our field with a B.S. I've started looking at other routes like finance or premed courses to apply with that to make me more appealing to job markets but I'm just trying to find something that works. Good luck to you!
publichealth,"Not the first, I did C++ way back in high school, so I was familiar with the world of coding. I also am learning SQL as well and have used SPSS for my biostats class. I do have some background in stats and have taken biostatistics in my program too. Right now I think I'm using regular SAS using SAS OnDemand and brushing up my skills. I can do the basic things like create datasets, run means, graphs, frequencies, execute batches and generate reports. So slowly getting there and hopefully this will help. "
publichealth,"As a left wing atheists l understand that health isn't a right but that it damn well should be. 
Also I like Sherlock Holmes moments."
publichealth,"If you can start looking for a part time job in the your school's city or town, do it. I worked in public health during my degree full time and it helped me pick practical classes, made finding my practicum easy, kept costs down since I was working, and allowed me to have a job at graduation. Now I have the two years of additional experience as well as my degree so it boosted me up while folks in my program that had trouble getting a job are just starting out. "
publichealth,"I agree! Apply and go elsewhere if they don't get it. 

I suppose it depends on what you ultimately want to do as well."
publichealth,"International university brand names don't go too far. Organization brand names fare better. An internship with any of the international NGOs or Singapore Ministry of Health would be magnitudes more important than your choice of school. Will either school help you get into an internship or offer public health research opportunities? If not, do well in school and get practical and research experience in public health and you will be good to go."
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"Realistically that was likely by far my worse Personal Statement. But I appreciate the support! "
publichealth,"That's interesting to hear about the EIS. 
Also just how much are MD's valued over PHD's? This isn't where I'm at currently, but say I were to decide that personally I may like the process of getting a PHD more than the process of getting a MD. Is the gap in preference between MD and PHD big enough that it might make practical sense to pursue the MD anyways? (Assuming that I like both routes well enough)

I know that this is really based on personal decision making but this could be a case of a slight preference towards one route ideologically/philosophically and a slight (or more than slight?) preference towards the other route in a practical sense."
publichealth,"I actually graduated October 2017, so it has been about more than half a year. I think its kinda discouraging knowing that many people from my class already landed something, so I feel quite left behind lol. Hopefully, my Vietnam internship will open more doors for me. Thank you for your words of encouragement! :)"
publichealth,Bleak. Need an MPH.
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"Yay! I'm graduating from it soon. I love it. But OP, keep in mind that it's on CEPH accreditation ""probation."" It still has it, but they have to update some stuff to meet it. So make sure they do that if that's important to you \(it is to me\). In my opinion, they'll probably meet it. They've been changing and improving a lot of stuff. Not that it needed it, but things for the CEPH accreditation rules. It's been nice tho, the changes. 

I'm only doing 1 class every 8 weeks. I focus much better this way honestly. Much more manageable. 

I never used online tutoring, but I did ask professors questions in many of the classes, and I always joined or created a facebook group with my fellow students in order to ask questions and get help from them during each class. It helps tremendously to have support, even if you don't use it. There's also a main UNE MPH facebook group, you may be able to join it now just to ask questions too. 

I think their online class format is pretty great. They've really studied the best was to educate online and continue to do so, according to the blog updates I get. 

Ask any more questions that you have! "
publichealth,Started out as an epi at my county health department. Now I'm a hospital administrator doing biostats at a hospital. I'm going to SAS until I die...
publichealth,"I read it as they are looking for an MPH with a strong science background.. "
publichealth,"SUNY Albany - you start with the certificate program and if you get 3.0 you can admit to MPH without GRE. All certificate classes are the core
MPH classes. As a nurse you might be able to leverage the certificate into a higher paying job and then continue onto the MPH"
publichealth,"Did you find anything in your search that you are willing to share c: ? If not, that's okay too!
I will definitely look into it myself though -- thank you for the info!!
And I didn't know HR was an option...I will keep that in mind.

Totally unrelated but I see maternal and child health next to your name -- are you currently in that field? If so, could I ask if you like what you're doing?"
publichealth,"That would make sense, or everyone graduating from some low ranked program would try to transfer their credits to a better program. 

This is my new plan. I currently work at a university and I am applying for a permanent position that would allow me to take coursework at a discount. 

Thanks for the advice :)"
publichealth,"It'll depend mainly on your field of public health and post\-graduation intentions. Overall, a good program will give you 1\) a solid foundation in public health methods \(epi, biostat\) 2\) have research dollars flowing in your intended field of study 3\) has connections to your intended job areas

Every school has its own strengths and weaknesses. GW has a weak core Epi/Biostat course, but strong job placement due to its location. Lots of HIV/AIDS and cancer research, and a good health policy program. If you are interested in government/NGO work and are self\-driven, it's a good place to go over a local school. Similarly, Emory is good for CDC placement, UNC great for families/academic research and so on.

I chose Johns Hopkins for its strength in coursework and its depth of international programs. I wanted to work with world class researchers. The opportunities I received through the research were well worth the cost \(especially since MPH is only a one year program\), and I credit the experience for helping me get my dream job.

If you're looking for advancement in your current employment, interested non\-specialized domestic concentrations \(health education\), or local PH jobs, a local school would make sense.

So, what goes into your personal opportunity cost calculation? Is the opportunity cost more than $80,000 over 5\-10 years?"
publichealth,"You wouldn’t necessarily need a masters in computer science either. You could get a certification. I think SAS has a test where once you pass you are SAS base programming certified. I did that as an extra after taking my intro SAS class in my masters program, but I think there are online and in person prep classes around. Once you had that certification, you could probably pick up some part time, then do remote work for a small job or two as a contractor. With additional experience you could then move into more complicated programming roles. 

For SAS programming, the base SAS is most of what you would need to be the secondary number checker for studies. Later you could pick up the more detailed programming for getting the displays to print out correctly (and be the primary programmer), and then finally you could learn more about CDISC formatting for the database, which the FDA is now requiring for studies, but just takes some time to learn how to correctly match all the rules. 

A masters in computer science will open more doors to many other roles in many different fields, but may be a more heavy duty program than you need to achieve your goals. But computer science is an awesome tool, and you can take it lots of places! Good luck!!"
publichealth,"I wouldn’t outright change majors. I wish someone had told me to switch out of public health or add another major but instead I just graduated with a Bachelors in health that will most likely get me nowhere. 

I’d recommend double majoring with public health or adding it as a minor. You need more concrete skills than what most CPH’s provide. Business or accounting with public health can help you break into health administration. Sticking with biology or another stem science with public health can help leverage you into more clinical work or possibly nursing/med school. For example, I find that most health educator positions in my area are really looking for RN’s. 

Have honest conversations with the advisors at your University and see what networking, alumni connections, and job placement they offer. My program director eventually just told me their only goal was to slam students into grad school but could offer me no advice on job prospects even with an MPH. I love public health but make sure to study the market and see what skills jobs are actually demanding! "
publichealth,"Yeah! So for about 75% of classes, I've had to buy/borrow one textbook. Almost all of them are available online through the university library though. So you can read them online for free. So you can chose to buy or just borrow, but there's only a copy or two to borrow online and sometimes you just have to wait a few minutes to have access to it. 

Some didn't require textbooks. There's a lot of online literature to read- journal articles, relevant health CDC WHO etc. webpages, with or without a textbook. "
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"I looked up that word. Are you Brittish/Aussie or just younger than me? Haha. Yep, looked for a second and you're Aussie."
publichealth,"Maybe try figuring it out based on [WHO weekly surveillance data](http://polioeradication.org/tools-and-library/policy-reports/who-weekly-epidemiological-record/). It would be easier if you could download the raw data those reports are based on, but I don't know if the dataset is public."
publichealth,"Possibly, good idea! I also have the opportunity for a full ride MSc- clinical research which aligns pretty closely with my interests and that particular program is fairly public health oriented, so I might just accept the seat there instead. "
publichealth,"The goal is to have a faculty mentor and participate in research or public health programs. Seems like you identified a smaller program which would get you there, and you made the right decision! Michigan is a good program, but USC is also a large school - I don't think you'll miss out on much."
publichealth,"D: But the cost of living in Denver is really high, isn't it?"
publichealth,Look into programs in South Africa. They're affordable for international students as well.
publichealth,"I'm going to Emory this fall and got a scholarship (strong research background), but many of the other students with scholarships were RPCVs-- so I can see that! Some current RPCV students also told me that having experience helped them get great internships also. :)

Emory and Michigan have VERY different career outcomes also-- so make sure to look into that when you apply! Good luck! :)"
publichealth,"It had to be really good especially with no experience . You have to show what you know about PH, why PH, what you will do with PH ... its kind of like your only way to sell yourself . Most PH programs are not about grades - except the top ones. The average PH program is pretty forgiving , you can be average or below average undergraduate student and be admitted to some program as long as your personal statement showcases why they should choose you and what you can contribute to the field "
publichealth,Following for responses as well.
publichealth,"You could talk to https://jeremynemeth.com/ about how best to structure this. He was chair of Planning and Design at University of Colorado Denver for a while and they hired new faculty with specific interest in public health because he recognized the strong connection between the two areas. He's a nice guy too.

I would have no problem on an admission committee understanding why you'd want to apply Urban Planning to public health, no problem at all."
publichealth,"Piggybacking, how do outlooks change when you start to consider NGOs, MPH or otherwise? "
publichealth,"When did you graduate? If you just graduated, say this month, it's going to take some months (public health is not a field where you get a job right away). It took me 6 months to get a job after graduation and I got a nice deal. It's not what I exactly what I wanted to do, but I'm working on working here to get where I want to be in the future. Whatever opportunity you can get, take it, even if it's not what you want. It can lead to many open doors. So go ahead and take the internship, plus the nice thing and added bonus is you get to experience a different country and culture! :)"
publichealth,"As a last\-year public health student, I could feel the incoming pressure of entering the workforce, with barely set practical skills and little to no real\-life experiences. Since this is your only opportunity at the moment to get into the field, I would say that you should give it a chance. The reasons I stated it was that as a local, I believe Vietnam is quite a dirt cheap place for foreigners to go. Particularly, you can comfortably live a day with about $5 for three good meals \(they are more scrumptious than McDonald's\), and the renting is not something unaffordable. Besides these, other types of entertainments, such as lively nightlife and traveling, are also available for you in case you get bored or home\-sick.

I don't know which city\(s\) in Vietnam the internship will be taken, but I could give you some further local insights if you are interested. In case of that, you can send a message to my Reddit account. Hope it helps !"
publichealth,"Interesting responses, thank you. I imagine the NYC department of health (DOH) would be more willing to hire someone with hospital experience than a fresh graduate. Also, I have heard that the onboarding process takes months at the DOH, so getting into the workforce quickly may only be possible at a hospital "
publichealth,"I think you should reflect on what type of person you are - and who you would become if choosing path 1 vs 2 vs 3. Are you someone who if not given any structure (especially path 3) would drift off and be less likely to complete grad school (if needed practically for your career goals)? Or are you someone who has a clear plan with start dates for graduate school and are using the gap semester to travel (path 2)? What do people who know you best (personality and goals) suggest? There also may be opportunities to travel/work/study/volunteer simultaneously, so you can be productive while living abroad. However, particularly for the degree, as people generally don’t get the same degree twice (only one shot), go for the best program unless you think you can get the position you want regardless because of your work background. "
publichealth,Most people and most employers that aren’t affiliated with public health have absolutely no idea what epidemiology is. It’s an uphill battle applying for jobs and interviewing with an epidemiology degree even though all the skills you learn with that degree are in demand.

publichealth,"I work with CDC internationally. 

1) There are many MDs who keep clinic hours, both because they want to keep the license and their practice, and also because it is a big source of income. 

2) In my eyes, either terminal degree would bring unique skillsets to the position. PhD would normally have better Epi and analysis skillsets. MD would be a medical epidemiologist, and understand disease etiology etc. In the eyes of CDC, the MD/MPH is much more valuable, and the MD is basically required for any leadership role.

3) No. Top level epi work, like top level of any other job is mostly meetings. This includes both internal and external stakeholders. Fieldwork/trainings are also required in many positions which deal directly with epidemic control. Computer work will normally be done by data managers/stats/mid-level epis people unless you're doing research.

4) As a PhD/MPH, I feel the lack of understanding of disease etiology and basic medicine is a major weakness. I compensate with my biostatistics and research skill sets.

5) Tough decision. GWU's strength is in its internships and practicum placement, but JHU is superior in all respects. GWU's Epi program is weak in my opinion. The faculty is great, but they teach to the lowest common denominator. I don't know much about BU.

MD/ Ph.D. is considered to be a largely research-oriented degree combination."
publichealth,Was your Americorps experience relevant to public health? I just got my BS and will soon start a year with Americorps--would you recommend a similar path of working directly after Americorps and getting the MPH on the side (as opposed to the MPH being the priority and only working part time)?
publichealth,"Interesting regarding the letters and good to know regarding the support available to lower income folks by the USDA, I never considered that as an option. One last follow-up: is it typical for those in a more rural area (which It sounds like you are) to cover such a big coverage area? Thanks again!!!

"
publichealth,"Wow - over a month? I've been under consideration for two jobs also, for about a week. It would be easier if the situation was such that I would feel comfortable moving in with him while I looked for a job, but he will be going there for medical school and living with a roommate for his first year so I don't feel comfortable doing that.

Anyway, good luck with your job search - hopefully they call soon! Thank you for the advice and encouragement :) "

publichealth,"I guess I'm fighting for a cause. I've always been bothered by the fact that our society, and all societies, let people die without a good reason. Heart disease, malaria, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, car crashes, drug\-overdose, whatever I can usually think of are unnecessary reasons to die and they're all preventable, but they kill *so many*.

I was raised to believe that we all have skills and that we all can use those skills to contribute to society and help others. I also don't believe this world is a zero\-sum game. The over\-enthusiastic morally driven and scientific side of me has figured out, through many experiences and over about 6 years of education and work, that public health was where I could do my part."

But really, if the person who finished the project didn't know what they we're doing, it's probably for the best your name isn't on it. "
publichealth,"I’m a former Kent State grad, and moved to NC after my master’s degree. That was 10 years ago, and I don’t regret a thing. Aside from the obvious things like better weather, beaches/mountains etc, it’s a great place re: PH career opportunities and growth with RTP, and top public health/pharmacy/med schools at UNC, Duke, Wake Forest etc. Ohio Might have those opportunities in some places, but nothing nearly as centralized as you see in the Triangle area (Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill).

On a more personal note, I was able to start my career, establish a professional network, go back and get a PhD, and land that dream job over that 10 years. I don’t think any of that would’ve been possible had I stayed in NE Ohio. Other than a few friends, my family, and Cleveland sports teams, NC has most of the good stuff Ohio does... and much more.

I’m not sure of your age, but I’m a Millennial (an older one), and the Triangle is especially excellent for people in their 20s and 30s. If you have nothing seriously holding you back, and are looking for a change to jump start your career, I’d say go for it. You wouldn’t be the only one - there are plenty of Ohio transplants!"

publichealth,"I started out with doing data entry at the state health department. I had a good supervisor who was an epi. I quickly made sure to show, verbally and through action, that I wanted to be an epi.

I will retake the GRE as well."
publichealth,"/u/jab296 is absolutely right, your application wouldn't be hindered by your GPA in any meaningful way.  Above a 3.0 is better than a B average, which more than enough for lots of good schools. 

Plenty of schools still have rolling admissions for the fall.  Don't be afraid to reach out to admissions departments to see what it would take to apply now if you'd rather not wait a year.  Also, some schools (even expensive ones) offer special scholarships (Yellow Ribbon Program) to veterans to help cover what the GI bill doesn't."
publichealth,"The job market isn’t bad at all. There are just a lot of degree mill mph programs. Lots of online schools, lots of crappy schools. Even though the field is growing, so are the number of schools trying to make a quick buck with MPH degrees. 

As far as the graduate statistics. Those stats are good. Emory is at like 94-96 usually I think. They do a more thorough breakdown of what exactly people are doing by concentration though. There may be a lot of part time work in that 92%. 

Like others have said, you have to find the value yourself. Research what they offer career development wise. Is there career coaching? How experienced are the coaches? How are the networking opportunities? Do you have access to career development resources after graduation? If so how long do you have access? Will you want to pursue a terminal degree (PhD, MD, DSc)? If so will the school be well known enough to get you through that process? 

There is no right or wrong answer for education. Just wanted to make you aware of both sides of the argument for and against a top school versus a state school. It all really depends on you. There are many people with me at Emory that just want to get their degree and work overseas with a nonprofit or work at a local health department. They probably didn’t need the Emory name behind them. But for each person like that there are those of us that want to go in to academia or a very competitive federal or consulting job market that probably couldn’t make it with a degree from a less well known school.

publichealth,Just recently watched a presentation on this and it was super interesting. Definitely a lot of research there.
publichealth,We are in the same boat. Your GPA is higher than mine.
publichealth,"Sounds like a good plan overall. I did the cheap in-state CEPH for my MPH (though not in Epi). For PhD your professors research areas matter more than it does for MPH. Have fun at USC- I'm at another SC university right now for my PhD and I've met a lot of their faculty through networking events and joint projects. They have some cool projects going on. "
publichealth,"This is great to know. In my limited research I came across some of these credentials and wondered if they would be valuable. I'm really just trying to learn some project management skills for my own use, but I can see it being a very marketable skill down the road, so I'll definitely look into it. Do you find it has been very relevant to your MPH?"
publichealth,"Following "
publichealth,"Sure! I have a B.S in Health science with a concentration in community health education and a minor in biology (which means nothing but I spent an extra semester to get it so I like to tell people). I did a 6 month internship while finishing undergrad with a local PH department working on telehealth.  After I graduated I did AmeriCorps for a year, doing fitness &amp; nutrition with kindergarten-3rd grade.  I absolutely hated it, but it gave me experience in something public health related AND gave me experience with kids. I also coached high school girls basketball for a few years, got experience with that age group. 

I then obtained an entry level position at a local PH department (different municipality than my internship).  I beat out something like 60 applicants but my boss said I got the job because the interview required a writing sample and I was the only person who managed to write more that a sentence. He also mentioned that I had experience working with kids so that helped him pull my resume to just get the interview.  -of note it took me 6months to get that job, this was right at the end of the recession and I had applied to about 70 jobs during that period and was eating a lot of cereal. 

I stayed in that job for 5 years,  2 years in I started a general online MPH program while continuing to work full time. I graduated in 2.5 years with $0 debt. I got a lot of experience in this job, my boss was hands off, he let me figure things out on my own. I also worked in a jurisdiction that was progressive, so I worked on some really neat, progressive stuff.  I also wrote and was awarded a $100k+ grant.  Even though I was in a lowly position I was able to make a name for myself throughout the state- in both of the programs I was working in.  - I'd be happy to elaborate if interested. 

After I finished my MPH I was fishing for a promotion, but the money just wasn't there.  I applied to 5 jobs got 3 interviews, accepted a similar job with a modest pay increase.  "
publichealth,"I had the same GPA and I'm actually going to Columbia in the fall. So I totally understand the worry. Your experience can definitely make up for it! I worked in clinical research for 5 years before applying to graduate school and even took classes at another public health school part time to work on my weaknesses. I took the GRE two times and worked obsessively on my application. I applied to several schools and even got aid from one. So all in all, please apply! "

My general impression that in order to get a book deal you typically have to have a portfolio of other publications, unless you've done something particularly interesting, impressive, or you have the right connections in the publishing industry. Never say never, but you'd be far more likely to land a book deal if you've already successfully pitched some magazines or other publications."
publichealth,"Is this in regards to the PH department in Boston? Or just the State program in general? "
publichealth,"My undergraduate degree is in Psychology and I chose to complete an MPH because I am interested in research and hoping to go into neuroscience (PhD) in the future. I'm applying for my MPH Practicum right now and its been frustrating because everything I'm matched to is direct clinical mental health, rather than public mental health.

But its totally possible to have a job combining both. If you think about all of the guidelines that go into Social Work practice/Psychology, those all come from people that are doing more of research or administrative work, which an MPH is great for. Plus with a MSW, you are guaranteed work and can probably move upwards within a company.

As for concentrations, I think it really depends on your program. I am doing the online through GWU and I wanted to focus on Global Health, but the curriculum is essentially the same for all students. "

publichealth,"I’m an Emory Epi grad (and was a student ambassador), and it sounds like a school in California is probably best for you. If you’re ultimate goal is to live and work in California then going to school there will open more opportunities for networking and doing practicums in the area. Not to say Emory would prevent that, but location makes a difference. 

One thing to look at for any school is work/practicum opportunities. Having helped make multiple hiring decisions, I can say work experience is the number one thing hiring managers look for on resumes. School name does matter to an extent, but if you went to a top program but did the minimum practicum requirements with no other relevant work experience then you’re resume will not stand out.

If you have specific questions about Emory related to your career goals, you can message me, but just based on your post a California school might be better."

publichealth,"Hi there! I am currently work as an Environmental Health Specialist Senior in a moderately sized county, and at this position I primarily conduct Food Inspections, and Food Establishment Plan Review. I also assist with farmers market food safety guidance, the rabies control program, aquatic health inspections, and soon I will become a lead risk assessor and be able to conduct site evaluations and testing. At my previous job, I also handled sampling and record keeping for the Transient Non-Community drinking water  program, Sanitary Surveys for Wells, and dabbled in Onsite Sewage.

My day to day job varies, as anything can kick in the door and happen. I attempt to answer emails and finish paperwork in the AM before restaurants open, and set up my schedule for the day, but another complaint came in that I have to respond to today. Also animal control is calling about a raccoon they want me to send up to the lab to test. this owner wants to come in in like 20 minutes to discuss your plan review comments and explain why he doesn't need a hand-sink here. Whoops, now my schedule for the day is out of whack.

At my other job I really enjoyed tooling around and getting my water and beach samples all day. This was in a rural county so I had to drive about 1 hr to get to my furthest site then work my way back. I was able to have a good mix of getting outdoor field work, office work, then restaurant field work. 

Also the rabies cases got insane. For example, X is hanging out with spouse Y in a carport. They both get attacked by a fox. X beats the fox off Y with a shovel, and they continue to chill and bleed all over the carport. The fox apparently circles the house and comes back for the rematch and attacks XY again. X beats it to death, and both X and Y go to bed, then wake up and head to urgent care. Blah blah blah, somehow the lab is able to accept the fox and test the brain, and its just stupid with rabies. I call them up and say ""X, Y, yall need post exposure shots"" ""No way, thats just yall trying to get money out of me, I wanna get tested for it to see if I even got it"" Sure X, I really wanna see how you manage to decap yourself. Fun times, and the animal control officers were the fucking best.

At my current job, i'm indoors way more :( but I enjoy the variety of the establishments I inspect, but good lord, I sometimes cannot deal with it when people lie to my face. At one establishment this dude had no concept of food handling. Almost every unit down, stuff on the stove isnt even warm enough to hot hold... I think I asked him if he took temperatures during cooking or cold holding or hot holding. ""YES EVERY TIME"" "" Ok get your thermometer and show me"" and he gives me a stud finder... :/

The worst part can be how you are managed. Micromanaging can become a huge pain in the ass when you are used to working independently, and it makes it a pretty stifling environment.

I graduated with an environmental health degree, and minored in IH/OH, so I covered most everything in school, but I was basically trained again, and there is a lot I don't use. Being familiar with access databases, water quality and being able to read and understand building plans and knowing where to go to find answers has helped me the most, as most everything else someone will teach you, or you have to be willing to teach yourself. I would honestly say that my old retail job and the customer service skills have probably helped me about as much as my actual degree though, since I work with the public a ton.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics the single greatest risk for SIDS or sleep related infant deaths is bed-sharing with adults. It is always a tragic, and preventable, event. There are bassinets that you can attach to your bed that allow the baby to sleep next to you but without the risks of sleeping in the same bed."
publichealth,"I also think you have to weigh what works best for you as a student. I didn't apply to the Top3 program because from talking to colleagues, I knew I was going to be a challenge to get face time with my professors and advisor. I have repeatedly picked smaller programs because I function better with more individual attention. So if you can get more specific career advice as well as avoid debt, that may be a solid option. Just be sure to do some research activities during your MPH because it helps with PhD apps. "
publichealth,I disagree. Learning about other health systems provides a great context for better understanding the US system
publichealth,"Well I love the work. I keep people safe and it's an interesting field that not a lot of people know about. It's Public Health with limited resources, limited time, and hundreds if not thousands of lives at stake. I'm also still here because finding a job in this field is extremely difficult."
publichealth,"Glad to hear that I made a mistake in character judgement =]

As for social work vs counseling vs different public health field**s** vs medical social work, I suggest that you check the job descriptions. 

Social work and public health are diverse fields with specific concentrations to fulfill their functions. You might want to make sure that you aren’t confusing medical social work and public health.

Medical social work: helping **individuals** and families navigate the healthcare system and meeting the biopsychosocial needs while being in the sick role (individual counseling, groupwork, family counseling and if you’re lucky about funder contracts, community development).

Public health: 

- management, design, assessment of the the health systems (health policy and management);

- to meet the current disease burden of the population and early warning of threats to it (surveillance)

- through understanding of risk factors from different approaches (epidemiology and biostats); and

- addressing the above and communicating it to to the population in a way people understand (health communication and practice of public health).

There’s a bit of overlap in the daily job nature  between the last function of public health and medical social work, but entirely different aims and mentality. Public health is ultimately about populations. Medical social work should have been about the macro structure, but advocacy and community development is sadly an underfunded aspect of social work— it’s mostly clinical and groupwork and above all, **case management**.

Social work also has other fields and I’d recommend this to start: https://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/38142_Chapter2.pdf

If you are in the States, you’ll need either an MSW  for social work or an MPH for public health at the minimum.

My advice is to think really hard about joining the field, and really do reach out. There’s r/socialwork to read up on what people do. They’re incredibly strong people. Also, make sure you have a functional self-care routine. Out of curiosity, I checked your profile and while there’s nothing wrong with blazing, you’ll need to be able to be 100% sober while dealing with a lot of stress, and be able to work through it in your down time and emotionally process a lot. In many ways, it’s use of self. Hope and self-acceptance are baseline criteria."
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,I'd really play up your GIS experience!
publichealth,"It is possible, but the advice I’ve been given is that it’s better to get some public-health related work experience first. "
publichealth,"Public health is relatively new, starting as a purely post-professional degree and evolving its own field of study with the MPH and BS programs. As it's becoming more well-known, more programs are starting up, with more graduates, and increased competition. Rather than viewing the Bachelor's degree as oversaturation, it fills an essential gap in developing entry-level clinical research coordinators, field investigators, and patient navigator/health education roles. There is no reason someone who invests in a Masters should be filling those roles. You can see the difference when looking at expected competencies at graduation in the top programs. 

* **Bachelor:** Able to complete public health tasks with minimal supervision. Understands how to interpret data and has a solid grasp of the introductory concepts across a wide variety of specialties. Has basic problem-solving skills, and competency for using computers in fundamental statistical analysis and data collection. 
* **Masters (or added experience):** Able to implement, manage, and direct health programs, conduct research, and integrate public health concepts into other settings. Has a deep understanding of public health in at least one specialty. Able to interpret and perform statistical analysis.
* **Doctorate (or added experience):** Able to design and lead public health programs and research. Can quickly structure and diagnose public health problems, and suggest solutions. Can conduct rigorous empirical analysis and explain scientific findings to the public through written and oral methods."

publichealth,"I came here to say this. Completely agree. The combo is valuable to prospective employers but clinical experience from the RN is where the combo becomes more lucrative. 

"
publichealth,"I was in the completely same situation as you! I actually worked part-time as a CRC while earning my MPH and then moved to full-time after finishing. If you're in a university setting, there are almost always classes and talks you can go to, and people to network with.

If thats not an option, groups like the Public Health Institute, APHA, Unite for Site and public universities have online webinars you can watch live or go through the back catalogue of. This is a really good way to keep up with current issues and research in the field.

Lastly, don't knock the experience of being a CRC! After 3 years in my position, I just got hired as a research investigator at my state department of health. My experience with online databases, patient surveys, data analysis and IRB all were part of the desired qualifications they were looking. You can always move on later, made better by the skills you've learned!"
publichealth,"What's your background with radiation?  Are you talking about ionizing or nonionizing? "
publichealth,"&gt; I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here

Being of African American descent is absolutely a risk factor for morbidity and certain medical predispositions. Just like being an Ashkenazi Jew makes one predisposed to certain medical conditions, like ulcerative colitis. The author's claim that racism is the only thing separating maternal mortality outcomes between different races and ethnicities is ludicrous.  I'm curious, are you a physician? Because you see, this is the problem when public health is a silo divorced from clinicians (like myself) who view everything from a sociologic perspective when in fact there are genetic factors in racial lineages, WHICH VERY WELL CAN BE THE PRODUCT OF HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL RACIAL INEQUITIES, but nevertheless to say that it's simply racism while dismissing a litany of other genetic, cultural, environmental, socioeconomic and behavioral factors is absurd. 

&gt; The environment we're talking about includes racism. I really don't understand how you're saying these things and coming to a completely different conclusion.

The author is dismissing a litany of variables and trying to pin health disparities exclusively on racism. That's just wrong. How many white people have sickle cell anemia? Why do african americans have different hematocrit levels than other races? Why do black women have slimmer pelvises? You're really going to blame that on racism? "
publichealth,"First off, you're not in as bad as a boat as you think you are.  I have a fairly similar story, college drop out, then joined the military, except I didn't even do my undergrad until after I got out, years later, while you're already done!  Also, your GPA isn't terrible.  3.3 isn't going to get you into medical school, but it got me into the MPH program at UPenn, so stop worrying about the number!  Your personal story is more compelling than just a GPA and GRE score.  Somebody who speaks chinese, has a military background, AND is going to be a lactation specialist?  Stop selling yourself short, you're potentially bringing a lot to the table.

It sounds like your interests are a bit scattered though, and that's okay.  The best part of my MPH was exposing me to different fields I had no idea existed.  You sound torn between stats, and community health.  I thought I loved policy until I went to grad school and discovered environmental health was really what attracted me.

I'd strongly encourage you to apply for an MPH if that's what's important to you.  I'm suggesting this for a few reasons.  First, it sounds like that's what you really want to do, and you're suggesting this second bachelor's because you're selling yourself short.  Secondly, your GI bill is awesome, but finite.  If you ever want more education, training, or to give it to your child, you'll have a lot more available going for a 2 year MPH instead of a 4 year degree.  And third, I think MPH's are a great way to find out ""what you want to be when you grow up"" because the curriculum forces you to get comfortable with all kinds of fields of PH.  Also, since you live in the DMV, let me tell you that federal hiring for public health jobs is hard, but in my experience it really helps if you have "", MPH"" after your name."
publichealth,"Thank you so much for sharing your experience. I definitely do not come from money, so I would have been in the exact same position as you. I actually committed to Yale, mostly because of the abundance of student funding for research, internships, and professional/academic travel."
publichealth,"Check gradcafe site, there usually is a thread for Canadian MPH applicants, so you can see when acceptances start rolling out "
publichealth,"Thanks! I already checked it out :) "
publichealth,"This one is older, during the start if the ACA, but does a good job paralleling the US with other countries. Helped me pass an exam in college bc I could describe the differences between countries with examples. "
publichealth,Whoo that’s a tough one. Would you really be willing to travel across two-three states for a possible entry level job? The only thing I can think of is to pick the state you’d really love to work in and rent a po box.
publichealth,"If your clinic experience includes working with the public, make sure you stress this, especially if the clinic served vulnerable populations.  Unlike the others I don't think being in a different state makes a big difference, lots of people go away to school and then want to move with a significant other or back home.  I think experience is really important, not necessarily quantity but quality (as long as you have over 2years, it's impossible to get a job over 30k in PH without 2years experience).  While I had a year of americorps, I had also added on the bottom of my resume that I coached middle and high school basketball.  Later my boss told me I was one of few who had any kind of experience working with that age group and the job was primarily working with high school students. "
publichealth,"Glad I could help, if you have any other questions feel free to PM me!"

publichealth,"I’m currently in this program, and worked five years after undergrad before going back to school. I worked for four years doing nonprofit fundraising and program implementation, plus a year with AmeriCorps. You might want to get some grassroots experience if your interest is policy- that can be the first door to other opportunities you want more. You also might want to check out health insurance companies and hospitals-they often times need researchers and policy people.  Where are you looking to work?"
publichealth,"I’m taking the online MPH program at SUNY Albany. The degree is in public health practice instead of claiming a specific concentration. So my core classes were essentially program planning/development, evaluation, implementation, etc. Along with a class for each public health track such as epi, biostats, environmental health... I’ve been able to fill my electives with classes that pertain to my interests  and that will qualify me to take the health education exam after I graduate so that’s been great! You also have to complete 3 internships in which you can pick and choose. "
publichealth,"This seems like the way to go - I'm sure I would find it fulfilling too. What kinds of work do you do for them? "
publichealth,"I also didn't think I would stand a chance based off of my mediocre GPA, but I said ""Screw it! I'm going to go for it and apply."" I studied and studied to kick some GRE butt, wrote a really passionate personal statement that was edited by 4 different people, capitalized my relevant experiences on SOPHAS, and I got into Columbia. Just go for it, you never know!"

publichealth,"Could you find a sample of current vegans and try to assess what motivated them to become vegan (the animals, nutrition, environmental sustainability, or one of a thousand different reasons), and what their vegan diet actually consists of?

Veganism can be done a variety of ways-- from the raw vegans who grow all of their own food, to the oreo vegans who eat processed, high sugar foods. I have heard lots of claims about how vegan diets are healthier, or that vegans are not getting the necessary nutrients they need (""where do you get your protein?""). If your volunteers actually logged all of their food, you could potentially assess whether there are any patterns of nutritional deficiencies/quality, and then explore how health communications can target vegans to help them address dietary deficiencies IF you find any. 

Full disclosure: I have been a vegetarian for a decade and am in the process of becoming vegan. "
publichealth,"It speaks to the initial ACA really well - but was published in 2014 so it speaks to anticipating the US moving in a more progressive direction than we actually are. "
publichealth,"Safe sex. Antibiotic Stewardship. Proper guideline medical treatment. All these things are needed. Too many PCP doctors do not do sexual health during annual physicals and it's baffeling to me. Not to mention many ER and Urgent Cares do no extra STD testing outside of a urine test and that's just not enough.


This is a fast and dangerous reminder that medical science is only as fast as we can keep up with evolution. "
publichealth,"The hugely disparate numbers given in the only data presented here are suspicious. There's so little known here that this might be a net good - in other words, that it's the kids that might otherwise have taken up smoking cigarettes who are vaping. 

I'm not saying that's the case, but from where I'm standing this typically panic-y article doesn't do that much to suggest that e-cigarettes aren't potentially doing a lot of good in switching smokers to a product that very plausibly has far fewer health consequences whether or not they give up smoking."

publichealth,US News rankings are worthless. They are based on a self-reporting questionnaire with no external validation or verification.
publichealth,"Not to piggyback on this, but much of what you mentioned sounds really interesting. I'll be graduating in a few month's time and have been eyeing research institutes in the area as potential employers. My background is in the social sciences and I've been looking for a way to merge the epi with the sociocultural training I already have.

With that said, do you have any opinions on the types of jobs, fields, organizations, etc., where one can do social epi research (or at least have it as a component of their overall work)? Policy seems to be a big one but beyond that I'm not sure.

Thanks for an insight!"
publichealth,"I'd recommend boning up on the basics of radiation first!  This is hard stuff, and knowing the right terms makes all the difference.  For instance, the radiation people talk about from cell phones is nonionizing, a totally different animal than the radiation from your granite countertops.

Unfortunately, I don't have a good book off the top of my head that isn't an eh textbook, and thus really expensive.  Most of the books I've seen trying to explain radiation to the general public are either trying to sell you on nuclear power or getting you against it."

publichealth,"Drexel is an option. I got in with slightly higher scores. I ultimately went with my undergrad, Arcadia University just outside the city because I was able to take a decent amount of grad credits during undergrad (I think this has changed since adding a public health undergrad program). I would recommend there if you don't want focus in on any one topic. 

If you're hoping to go somewhere with a school of public health, rather than just a program, check out Temple. 

If you don't like Philadelphia, disregard my comment. "
publichealth,"You could do a community based assessment of openness / acceptance of veganism. Look at different populations and how it might vary across SES, age, race, gender, ect. However, for a master's it might be best to do a project working with pre-existing data if you aren't funded."
publichealth,"So reassuring! Thank you! "
publichealth,"I work for an international NGO. I'm EU based, so my study career/job prospects are different than yours (I assume you are US based)

Truth be told, I just got lucky. I did an internship at my current NGO after post grad studies in pharmacy, they took a liking into me and we kept in touch. 7 months after I had finished the internships I was still jobless, because pharma industry skills didn't match the ones I developed at my workplace. 

Fortunately, a position opened up at my workplace, so I was hired after a selection process. I was familiar with internal guidelines and procedures, so I had an advantage.

In essence, your internship will not only prove to be a good starting point, but will also potentially link you to other stakeholders in healthcare. **Don't get discouraged and keep looking, you'll get there.**"
publichealth,"I'd say go for it - how can you make policy that will affect hospitals if you don't really know how they work? The day to day pressures they face? The things that matter to the staff and patients? Don't just be a detached policy wonk,   understand the policy decisions from the inside. The world would be a better place if no one was allowed to make policy before they'd worked at the end of the sector it will affect."
publichealth,"Not at all. What you earn as a professor is based off the school you teach at, not where you got your masters. Get your MPH, pick up as much research experience as possible, get good grades, rock the GRE and get funded to do your PhD at a top school. That’ll make more of a difference in the long run."
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"What is the reason for the unemployment? Due to geographic reasons? Concentration area (and a potential lack of positions, possibly also limited by geographic factors)? Competition in the field? School/program reputation? I've always been under the impression that public health was a growing field and that this is the time to get an MPH. I received mine in 2014 and have been employed since then, but at the LHD level. 

Edit: I just don't want OP to get the wrong impression about the public health field. But I also think OP needs a more in-depth understanding of what public health is before jumping into it."
publichealth,"I don’t think you need to at all, especially if you end up going into virology. The biology background would help you."
publichealth,"this should be stickied to the top of the subreddit "
publichealth,"You're off to a much better start than most. A lot of people in my MPH program were humanities majors, so when they were first confronted with SAS, a few were driven to tears."
publichealth,"The other posters are correct, you'll be fine and on the whole, the MPH is not a difficult degree. If you want to get ahead, start playing around with your program's statistical software of choice (SPSS, SAS, STATA etc). Also, if you know GIS, you'll be an asset to many professors."
publichealth,Biology or Microbio are great gateways for virology! I am a public health major (BS) and wish I had done Microbio as a major (to give me a stronger natural sciences background) and some form of public health as a minor. Live and ya learn.
publichealth,Witz in Johannesburg is a good school! A few Hopkins projects affiliated with their Perinatal HIV Research Unit so there is a connection there with a US school without having to pay the Hopkins prices for a degree

publichealth,"Oh, interesting. Is your social epi background at the master's level? Is a combination of sociology/epidemiology (as in, say, an MA and MPH) a way of getting that experience, or is it really something that happens at the doctoral level?"

publichealth,He makes more than the NIH director and the previous 2 CDC directors. At some point it's ridiculous.

publichealth,"That's a great idea. I know two epidemiologists so I will contact them and see about job shadowing. I know that my old university has a summer program for current students to job shadow at the health department and so I will see if I can somehow get into that program.

I really like the program at Hopkins but unfortunately after reviewing my resume I did not meet the minimum experience requirement. Yes Hopkins is pretty expensive."

publichealth,"With regard to dental/oral health, Teeth by Mary Otto is a very good read. Introduction to US Health Policy by Barr is a very good primer on the history of the US healthcare system, though it mostly applies it in context of implementing ACA.

publichealth,How absolutely wonderful!!!
publichealth,"It's tough to say. I am of the mind set that you make the best out of your situation. Whatever data entry you do end up doing, teach yourself some technical skills like using excel, Microsoft access and then a programming language like SAS or R or Python. "
publichealth,"Ooh, do you happen to have a link to the research? I'm really curious to read it!

All of my comments were mostly anecdotal - I was working in DTLA over a period of 5 years and noticed the increase then so I would love to read any legit research on the subject! "
publichealth,"This looks really interesting to do in my free time, I'll definitely check this out. Thanks :) "
publichealth,I don't think anyone has said this yet- The best thing you can do for yourself now is to focus on the GRE! A high GRE score plus work experience can totally balance out the GPA. Low GPA and GRE are hard to overcome.
publichealth,"I would say that with a bachelors in public health you probably already have more experience with the field than most applicants for mph programs. If you are really interested in an mph (and from what I have seen mph is the bare minimum entry level as far as Epi is concerned) then just go for mph. I go to one of the top mph programs in the country and even at a top program our intro data/stats courses were very geared towards beginners in biostats. As long as you have the prerequisite classes to be able to apply, I would say apply sooner rather than later. Most reputable programs have both research (thesis) and real world (practicum) components that will further strengthen your skills over the course of the program. 

If you aren’t competitive due to low GRE or GPA at the programs you want then work experience could help you out. But that all depends on the strength of your current resume. If you do look for work experience then research coordinator, research specialist, or volunteering are the routes I would suggest. However often times research coordinators require a masters and research specialists are from the hard sciences. Perhaps there are some entry level jobs at your local health department or with a nonprofit. But those types of extremely entry level positions probably won’t provide a training style environment where you can learn new skills, only brush up old ones. The best place to learn to work with healthcare/clinical research data is in an mph program. Data entry isn’t really a skill set that is super marketable. Sure there are many positions that require data entry but generally if you have data analysis skills you will also have the data entry skills. Unless you are specifically building access databases"
publichealth,"Right now, it's mostly providing advice and subject-matter expertise for community kids programs. I have friends who sit on committees that work on program evaluation, at work health programs, and around town (work on making the community more bike/walk friendly).  It's all networking though... I'm currently on rung #1 of the ladder and have a ways to go before I'm invited to join others. I've found it's a really good way to actually know what's going on with the decisions that are happening in my community though. "
publichealth,"My GPA was similar, I applied to University of Texas (accepted), University of Alabama (accepted with scholarships), and University of North Carolina (not accepted).

Just apply! What do you have to lose? "
publichealth,"You'll have to look at the actual class list for each course. Because the two have a huge overlap.  I suppose epi  is more  academic and biostats is more clinical trials? Art least in the UK.   
Note that neither  is public health."
publichealth,"Off topic, can I ask what field?"
publichealth,"Rankings do not matter. What matters is your fit with the program, and the resources they have to offer for you to achieve your career goals. Faculty research, class size, job/internship/higher education placement, and alumni network are important things to consider.

I won't comment on cost because the importance of that varies by individual. Not all MPH programs are created equal, so the cost-benefit analysis relies on what you want out of your education."
publichealth,Hey that’s really cool! I’m trying to find jobs in the state department but so far haven’t found a Data entry one. Most of the data entry jobs I’ve found are for insurance and private health groups. Do you think those are good places to start?
publichealth,"I was agreeing with you but with a slight difference. I then provided view the differences between the two disciplines since the thread is largely about the differences between the two. There is certainly more flexibility for applications if you are biostats and there is a really high need for statisticians right now. I’m epi as well and while I understand the statistics my mindset is developing a hypothesis in regard to the issue I am studying then looking at the statistics to gain insight and either prove or disprove my hypothesis. It’s all a spectrum and all depends on what you find the most interesting. "
publichealth,What's the purpose of the list? HRSA has a pretty good database
publichealth,"Any advise on how to search for a job? I have no experience right now and, like you said, I really need experience before graduating. I've tried talking with teachers but none have been helpful yet. I've forwarded my resume to some data entry places an no word yet. Freaking out because I'm graduating next year, and I really don't want to be a barista the rest of my life. "
publichealth,Now I really want someone to make a comic of a neckbeard vaping and the 'cloud' spells out m'lady.
publichealth,"Pretty much. Everyone at Emory has to complete core courses: Biostats I, Epi I, Global Health, Environmental Health I, and Health Policy/Management I (not the exact name of the courses, but you get the idea).

Other than that, the BSHE MPH students have to take a Quantitative Methods course. I suppose you can take extra courses in quantitative data analysis beyond that as electives, but it will be difficult. Especially if you're in a certificate program (Emory has a number of certificate programs you can add onto your Masters).

I'm not saying you can't do more quantitative skills building with a BSHE track MPH, but it won't be as easy as if you were in epi or biostats.

You could try to switch to epi department after you start at Rollins, but it's not easy, as you need to demonstrate ability and interest in epi, which can be difficult if you have only had one or two classes to demonstrate that."
publichealth,I was actually wondering if there was some way I could peek into prison reform policy for some sort of job but I’m having trouble thinking of an appropriate position
publichealth,"Thank you! Yes, I would say sign up to take it as soon as you finish your last core course. I was nervous/hesitant to take the exam and kept telling myself that I would sign up when I had time to study. I wish I would have just taken the plunge sooner and taken it earlier. Good luck! "
publichealth,"I only knew a few PhD students, but they all seemed happy. One was working full time in another industry while getting her PhD, and another one worked in my lab. I think the students there are happy. They take classes with the MPH students for the first couple years and then move on to PhD level courses. I don't, however, know what Rutgers offers their students in terms of tuition assistance though.

I think as goes with all PhDs, you should be fine as long as you like your adviser. "
publichealth,"I've heard that UW-Seattle has a very strong program for implementation science. Hopkins is not quite there yet IMO, though there are some professors who are involved with it and it is gaining popularity. I think that a MSW/MPH program definitely makes sense for IS, having the practical experience of the MSW and the work that entails would inform the IS research needs which is really important. Not sure about the mixed methods research programs though. "
publichealth,"Thank you for the info! This is super helpful. I do have one question regarding textbooks. Is the textbook situation similar to traditional classes, or is the literature more online material? Thanks!"
publichealth,"FYI some MPH programs have a 1-year option for those with doctoral degrees. (Yale’s Advanced Professionals MPH is one.) "
publichealth,"I took 4 semesters of biostatistics not because I enjoy it/am particularly good at it/wanted to, but because I had to to be competitive in the field. I’m going for my Ph.D. now, but the advice I got and will pass on is take as many biostatistics courses as possible for an MPH in Epi. Also be comfortable in coding software program (SAS, R, Stata, etc.) just pick one and become fluent in it and pick up some skills with other programs as well."
publichealth,Biostats
publichealth,"Social work bachelor and studying MPH. If you want to do public health, you’ll definitely need more. Social work will help but the knowledge structure and perspective are different. 

Not sure how you jumped from psychology to social work, there are parallels between public health and social work and they complement each other, but you’ll definitely need health-specific knowledge or you’re SOL. Health systems, ethics, administration, funding etc, differ from social welfare systems and so do the approaches. Behavioral science will help. 

Also—no. Social work is a professional job requiring a practicum and specific training, you can’t go in there with just a psychology background. There’re welfare systems to learn, generalist approaches and case management and all that. As well as practice frameworks. Psych is a definite bonus if you want to do counseling.

TBH, if I were in either field, I’d be a bit reticent to take you on as you are right now: both fields are concerned with the common good, and managing public resources. You seem to be attracted to them due to how it benefits you, which while important (see: Maslow) is disconcerting in combination with your lack of knowledge of both fields. If you want an easy life, social work is definitely not for you. "
publichealth,"I am unsure, but i'd like to know this too. I have a BS in Health education and am in medical sales. My goal is to become a researcher tho and I know that takes grad school :)
"
publichealth,"Very thoughtful thank you! I chose the University of South Carolina over Michigan largely because of cost, ability to stand out, and my undergrad advisor had some connections so he put me in touch with some the faculty there. South Carolina has small cohort sizes but I didn’t get the impression of lack of funding or focus in my conversations with them or during my visit. "
publichealth,"Thank you, definitely makes me feel even better about my decision! "
publichealth,"To clarify my point about storytelling: if someone doesn't believe in vaccinating their kids, share a story about someone who didn't vaccinate their child and regrets their decision because their kid died or something terrible like that. The point is to change the dialogue they are most likely hearing in their own circles, which is that vaccinations are dangerous, and show that not vaccinating is dangerous and could cause them a lot of pain and potentially cost them the life of their child."
publichealth,I agree and it's something to consider.
publichealth,Not yet
publichealth,"Yup this is known as an IRD organ offer. Some centers refuse to take these organs - which is a waste. If your a doctor you can always get more info on the organ. Weird stuff about IRD - if you are MSM then your organs are automatically IRD. If you’re the child of a mother that was imprisoned you might be IRD. If you ever injected drugs you’re IRD. It ends up being like 1 in 5 organs. "
publichealth,How We Do Harm is incredible. I read that the first year of my MPH and I’m currently a research assistant at Grady because of it.
publichealth,"There is also a lot of variation between programs and degree type. 

If you are looking for hard skills, you should consider an MS in epi or biostats, because either will probably give you more quant experience than an MPH. MPH degrees have a stronger emphasis on public health practice, and require you take core public health courses in topics such as environmental/occupational health and health policy.

Second, some schools are more quant focused than others. I reccomend looking at course requirements and reaching out to current students to get a feel for this.

Source: I read through curriculum requirements of epi and biostats at about 30 schools when I applied last year"
publichealth,"I've been looking at Texas A&amp;M's program, and they recently changed all their degree plans. They are similar, in terms of coursework, but I am struggling to find stats as to job placement of their alumni. Do you have any suggestions of what I should do?"
publichealth,"Yeah, come to think of it I didn't realize it would be much of a need until I was post-MPH, but if I had known more about project management I could have applied it in my program planning/program evaluation courses as well. Good luck on the rest of your education!"
publichealth,"The /r/publichealth community is aimed at professionals with an interest in public and global health. Recruiting participants here would likely provide very skewed data.

publichealth,"Cracking up at ""Cards statement means something to these folks"""
publichealth,"Oh, that's a surprise. MPH is completely separate here - its usually policy and health economics focused, with one or two basic stats classes."
publichealth,"Actually that's a great idea, I'm not sure why I didn't really think of that. I'm taking a nutrition course right now and would love to do an internship in that area because I work with eating disorders right now. But every position has required that a person has an RD.

publichealth,"I'm a social epidemiologist. Contrary to what /u/ctrl-all-alts has to say, I don't think we're ""almost tapped out"" nor do I think Kawachi is not the only game in town (arguably not ""the top"" at all). There are large, growing bodies of research on such topics as the effects of incarceration on health and neighborhood influences on health. That's all social epi.

&gt; Is social epidemiology an MPH-level concentration, or is it a mix-and-match of social + behavioral and epidemiology?

I don't think it's either. Social epi is a subfield within epidemiology that analyzes the way social relations (everything from families to the global economy) shape the distribution of disease in populations. There are defined sets of theories that social epidemiologists use that are not found in other social/behavioral sciences, ranging from psychosocial theories to the WHO's social determinants of health, to Nancy Krieger's ecosocial theory. We do borrow from a range of other fields, but that's not at all unique to social epi. And sociologists sometimes do similar work, but they tend to be less concerned with specific disease mechanisms than we are.

I'm not sure what exactly you're asking beyond this, but I'm happy to offer any insight if you have more focused follow ups."
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"Won't the online schools be similar in cost to the programs you got into (USC and U of New England)? If they admitted you they must think you are somewhat qualified at least. For MPH programs the emphasis on the practicum makes me question the usefulness of online programs if you don't already have a higher degree (DVM, MD, JD). 

Retake the GRE, try again for masters programs, and just do the best you can!"

You don’t have to be a health educator if you do have an MPH, and much of the work is mostly alone at a computer, but I’m not sure how much of a pay bump it would be. "

1) read ALL the faculty bios in my department &amp; do keyword searches to identify faculty in other departments with research interests that align with mine. Go to their office hours (or email if not possible), tell them you've read XYZ paper and are interested in their research for ABC reasons, and ask if they have any openings, or know of anyone you can reach out to. 
2) Go to office hours of the professors you are taking, and talk to them like an advisor, since yours isn't helpful. Even if they don't have any openings or current research projects, they might have ideas about who does and can make connections for you...
3) Look for off-campus research opportunities. Google keywords related to your interests + your location. Check job posting sites like Indeed, and search websites like Charity Navigator.
Best of luck!"
publichealth,"I’m at Emory which is up there with Hopkins as far as costs go and I think that the cost is worth it for me personally. I have some financial aid that offsets the costs but I’m definitely paying more than a state school. I had the option of a full ride at Georgia state or Emory and I picked Emory because of what they offer career development wise versus Georgia state. Georgia state wouldn’t tell me/didn’t know about the job outlook of their graduates. Emory has a detailed breakdown of how many graduates are still looking for work and what fields the graduates with jobs are working in. That was the big decision maker for me. The state school didn’t back up their graduates when it came to job statistics. For me it wasn’t “am I going to make more with a degree from Emory” it was “would I have a guarantee of a job if I went to Georgia state”. 

Granted my career goal is CDC which is one of the more competitive employers and you can’t really beat Emory when it comes to networking opportunities and opportunities to work with the CDC specifically. 

I would just say to be cautious on who you get advice for when it comes to this topic. There are many people I have met in my work study program that think you don’t need a prestigious degree. However most of the time they base that on how competitive the hiring was when they applied 10-15 years ago. When you talk to people that currently have experience with the job market, it can be very difficult to find a full time position and a degree from a well known school could definitely help you out. 

All in all though, to answer your main question, I would say that the issue isn’t salary differences but how competitive you are as an applicant with each degree. Salaries are pretty consistent and not that dependent on your degree within specific job titles. The only place a fancier degree will get you a fancier salary is if that degree makes you more competitive for hard to get, high paying jobs where a state degree might not get you the time of day. "
publichealth,"That seems like an appropriate salary for that position. "
publichealth,"Maybe. Getting a degree with a focus on global health is different than biostats. You should consider how you may want to market yourself in the future. If you go the biostats route at a school with weak global health connections, you may have a difficult time getting a global health job if that's an avenue you want to explore. Gdec graduates end up with both domestic and international focused jobs."
publichealth,"PH is a huge field, what do you want to do?  What parts of your job do you hate?  What skills do you have that you want to keep using?

There are totally online degrees, and MPH's online shouldn't be too hard to find.  But it depends on what you want to actually do once you have that degree"
publichealth,"Yea, that's a great idea! I have thought about it but didn't know how well it would turn out. I'll definitely try it out since my assignment is due soon! "
publichealth,"Interesting article. Kolodny (mentioned in the article) said in the Annual Review of Public Health in 2002 that only 15% of addicts have access to treatment, including medication-assisted treatment such as Buprenorphine.

publichealth,"While I was at the health department, there was a person volunteering there and helping with surveillance work. Not sure if you are doing epi or something else, but the health department could be a good route."
publichealth,"I'm a Health Policy major, and I will answer this from that perspective:

**I'm sure this varies widely by subfield, but how long does it take for epidemiological research findings to translate to practice and policy, assuming they get that far?**

This depends on the subject and the impact on the public, as well as political acceptability. There are a few theories that address the likelihood of something becoming law (e.g. multiple streams theory), but it really depends on the context is the best answer I can give.

Politicians and those making laws typically don't move on things unless they know the support is there (to avoid primaries and unhappy constituents), so it can be slow or it can be fast. It also depends on how effective interest groups can be at lobbying, too.

In short: there's a lot of moving pieces and that's why it takes so long regularly.

**How can epidemiologists speed up that process?**

I personally believe all research funded with tax payer money need to be published in open access journals, but I also don't think that's a reasonable expectation given the current climate in research and academia.

It's not a big move, but at least having your work published open access would make it easier for others to see your work. Other than that, knowing policy analysts, etc. might be helpful."

publichealth,What about social work do you think may help you meet your career goals (what are your specific career goals)? Do you imagine working 1:1 with people as a social worker?

publichealth,"My MPH program teaches the two together as Epi/Biostats I &amp; II because, as my professor says, epidemiology is the study of disease and biostatistics are the toolbox.

Yale's job placement and alumni network are strong in NYC, Boston, and DC (I'm a current student).  If those regions appeal to the OP, the access to Yale’s alumni network will help a lot. If the OP prefers to stay in CA or WA, UCLA or Berkeley will make more sense given the lower price tag."
publichealth,"Post-college debt is a giant weight that just drags you down and makes life terrible. Do everything you can to avoid any debt. I know 30k doesn't sound like a lot, but that will likely even out to 150-200 dollars more a month in student loan repayments on top of all of your other debt. That kind of debt means you have to wait much longer to get a down payment on a new house, you won't be able to travel, you won't be able to afford hobbies etc. Your parents and your friends won't be the ones shouldering this debt. 

And watch out for books, fees, parking, room and board, technology fees, IT fees, etc. All of that stuff racks up quickly and colleges intentionally keeps those costs out of credit hours so they appear to be financially competitive. 

I would also consider where do you want to end up after graduation? A California school would give you much better networking in CA opposed to an east coast Ivy League school. I would also ask you, do you think having a degree from Yale would preclude you from many entry-level jobs? Would HR just assume that they couldn't afford you? Would hiring managers be afraid that you would try to take their job?

If you want to stay in CA, I would suggest looking for any job that has tuition reimbursement. 

"
publichealth,"You'll be okay. I would recommend trying to find any work experience, no matter how tangential. I interned at a health department and was able to turn it into a job offer. Even going back as an office assistant and asking to shadow or help the epidemiologists would be a good start. You can also look for clinical/program coordinator jobs, which are a low level entry mix of public health research and adminstration.

You can get by with poor math skills if you learn to be a good communicator and go in the direction of education or advocacy, but knowing basic biostatistics will be important in field epidemiology."

publichealth,"Thank you very much for the links, I'll make sure to check them out.

I'm gonna be honest here: I have wealthy parents who wouldn't mind paying, but I honestly dislike how tuition work in the US and I do not feel comfortable financially suporting such a system. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am also very well aware that the best universities are found in the West/parts of Asia, but a big reason why I want to study abroad in the first place is because I am frustrated with my life here in a austria and need a drastic change of scenery, India as just an example. That is also why I do not wish to do an online course, as that would defeat the purpose of wanting to move elsewhere. 


I am also fully aware, that it would *probably* be smarter to finish my degree here in austria and then look for a job elsewhere, but the idea of living elsewhere has always appealed to me and I thought the idea of studying in India and then working there (as a european) might give me some advantage? I honestly don't know.

publichealth,"After undergrad I couldn't get a job in public health. They all wanted MPHs or ridiculous # of years of full time experience. So I accepted a clinical research job offer even though it was unrelated to HPM. I still got into HPM programs at schools like JHU, UNC, and Columbia. Not saying this to brag but rather to let you know that these schools are aware that many applicants are ""career changers"" and won't count it against you if you don't have direct policy or consulting experience. So long as you have general public health experience (e.g., volunteer, summer internships) you should be fine.  

If you cannot find a policy-related job, I recommend a part-time UNPAID internship with local health department. Unfortunately I think the paid positions are reserved for masters/people with extensive experience. I also recommend doing weekend volunteering at a local clinic that serves a targeted population. AmeriCorps is also very well regarded. "

publichealth,"So, just personal experience, but a Masters in Health Administration \(or a Masters in Public Health, which is the analogue in the public sector, but some people treat them interchangeably for academic experience\) basically is the field of managing private or public benefit programs, medical records administration, health data analysis, public policy, hospital or clinic management, and running NGO health concerns. There's a lot of facets to the field, and the salary is commensurate with that. You might make anywhere around from $25K working for an global NGO \(if you're lucky\) to $50K in the public sector up to $150K in the private sector as a consultant to other people in setting up health care systems, benefit programs, or doing analysis of current programs. The work is largely 9\-5, but depending on your role it can allow you a great deal of flexibility, as many aspects of the jobs people get with those degrees they either expect you to tell them how to run things, to monitor that things are running as they should, or supervise the staff who manage all the things. 

Since its not unusual for one person to be affiliated with several institutions, some people make good money representing a group of hospitals or clinics without being tied to a specific office or workplace. If you travel a lot, that's an additional benefit as your living expenses are basically being subsidized by whatever organization you are working for in addition to your salary, but it's not counted towards your income \(the downside is not having a home or having one that just seems to be for dusting and laundry\). The travel lifestyle is not for everyone, as it requires you have a high tolerance for living without being tethered to a place or people, so it's not a good career for introverts."

I've gotten very useful and employable skills for a fraction of the price and while I haven't landed another job yet, I'm currently employed by my university so I'm not in a rush but there seems to be no lack of opportunities for me here. I think not being in debt has allowed me to be more choosy about what job I'll eventually take without feeling the added pressure of having to pay off loans. I really think as long as you get meaningful work experience while you do the MPH you'll be fine as far as employment. A lot of people are afraid of stats/anything math related so you'd be surprised just how marketable it is to know about it even at the MPH level."

publichealth,"From what I've heard throughout the time in my program, accreditation is important. If you're really decided on your school, I'd look into how long the process takes to become accredited and then compare that to when you plan to apply/attend. "
publichealth,"Even if both schools lead you to the same salary, the one that gets you hired faster wins. And usually the one that gets you hired faster is also the one that gets you to higher salary levels, too. So, find out whether both schools have a career office, an alumni network, and an accessible faculty, all connected to the field you want to go into. *That* will make a difference in whether you can get hired or not.

(Yes, it's a pretty safe bet that JHU will have all that, but you should do your due diligence and ask about it.)

I disagree with commenters who tell you not to go into debt for MPH; I'm at Yale, most of my classmates go into some amount of debt for their MPH, and literally everyone has decent jobs lined up before they graduate. No issues paying off the debt among my classmates. 

People who go to a school where they don't have a good career outlook because the school is, more or less, a diploma mill should definitely not go into debt for MPH though. If you go to a school like that, you're left to fend for yourself come internship / job time, and you will lose that contest to someone who's gone to a well-connected school. "

publichealth,"I'm currently enrolled in UNE's online MPH program.. I love it! 
"
publichealth,"I am actually Canadian based, so I am looking for opportunities in Toronto or Ottawa. So during my MPH program, I was placed with a non-profit organization. After graduation and months looking for a job, I found out that the same organization that I did my placement (the non-profit) had another internship for their Vietnam office hence I applied for it. It is not really paid, however, they do cover travel, accommodation, and a monthly stipend."
publichealth,"I think it depends on what route you go with your career. If you go into consulting, you could be a pure industrial hygienist. IHs I know working for NIOSH or the Public Health Service are fairly ""pure IH"" as well, though their work is more academic.

As far as the public sector \(OSHA or state\-level organizations\) goes, it seems to be on an office\-by\-office basis. I know my state level agency is reducing its workforce, so IHs who once did strictly sampling are now getting more ergonomics and general safety workload. And the OSHA IHs I know split their time, again due to reduced staffing in the area office.

If you're looking into corporate ESH, it will depend on the company. There are large companies that have IHs doing strictly IH work, but a company with a smaller ESH department or with less emphasis on safety may have you in a catch\-all position. Even the companies that have ""pure"" IHs often only have one or two.

As for a trend in the field, I don't necessarily see it as a bad thing. I think a broad knowledge base is important, especially to remain competitive in the field. There are companies out there who may not have the need for, or resources to devote to, a full\-time industrial hygienist. But having a general ESH person who understands how to perform industrial hygiene assessments can be a valuable asset."
publichealth,UAB - started this spring after graduating in December.
publichealth,"Absolutely take this internship. People during their MPH sometimes seem to forget that an MPH is all about building hard, demonstrable skills, and building a professional network. That general track MPH is a bit unfortunate in that although it didn't shoehorn you in to one discipline, it didn't likely give you a chance to build and showcase skills in data analysis, etc. And given you're going up against individuals who may have experience **and** a specialized degree, you're at a disadvantage.

This opportunity in Vietnam could be a great way to work on gaps in experience, skills, and networking. Work hard while you are abroad to build and demonstrate skill in whatever you can (depends on the role and the organization), be it data collection and analysis, community engagement, health communication, policy briefs, etc. 

Take the time to reach out to public health professionals within the organization and at other organizations. Showcase your skills and ask them for career advice. Don't make it (necessarily) a ""what can you do for me?"" conversation, but rather ask them what skills you should build, experiences you should have, anything they would have done differently, etc. Building and maintaining these professional and personal networks are extremely important as I truly believe a lot of public health jobs are going to people who know people within the organization they're applying to. Might seem a bit Captain Obvious, but it can be the difference between being just another interview and being one of the top candidates who gets the offer.

One caveat: Read through the internship carefully. If it's unpaid, see if there's *any* assistance the organization would provide. Living in Vietnam isn't going to be *as* big of a burden financially as life in the US, but think through all the costs associated, compared to the benefits to you in work experience, etc. Chances are it will still be worthwhile, but just make an informed decision.

TL;DR: Take the Vietnam gig. Focus on building: your skills, your public health portfolio, and your professional network."
publichealth,"Depending on where you are, now is a great time to have a little experience in tobacco control.  That's my discipline as well.  I used indeed mostly, but I would also check out the local government sites and sites for organizations you may have come across during your practicum, (thinking American Lung, and whatever local tobacco control grantees are working in your state). Ask your supervisor for suggestions, tobacco control should be connected with one another.  Also if your state has legalized marijuana, you might look in this area as I expect legislation will follow the footsteps of tobacco control. "
publichealth,How do you feel about studying part-time while traveling? Does that seem like too much of a commitment? I've read online that it's both doable and not suggested (due to distractions).

publichealth,"Just to emphasize, EIS used to be a golden ticket, but after 9-11 all 'big' situations are handled by CDC itself out of Atlanta. This means two things: most (domestic) EIS officers now deal with mundane things like norovirus and livestock outbreaks. There are also far fewer state-level postings, as many Dept PH offices are happy to let CDC handle it, and so have defunded internal epi depts.

For EIS- also have no control over where you go- so Omaha, Cheyenne and Reno... while NYC, LA, etc are exceedingly competitive.

I think MD/MPH or PhD/MPH is the best option. MDs always win out over PhDs- whether or not that makes sense is open to debate, but it's the reality. 

I would steer away from MD/PhD. It's prestigious, but IMHO very often optimized for neither. And DrPH.... hmmmm. I feel like no-one *in* the field has a clue what it actually is, let alone outside, but that may be changing."
publichealth,"Literally looking into this now. Only reason is because I'm a former airline employee myself and considering breaking back in with my MPH. 

It's possible. I know some RNs primarily working with hygiene, communicable disease. There are small networks of environmental health specialists for some airlines as well, I believe.

Also, HR is an option and going the employee wellness/health benefits route. Not exactly MPH-focused, but loosely related. "

publichealth,If the cigarette industry supports the behavior than I have to question it personally.
publichealth,"I’m assuming OP has zero experience with biostats here and I’m writing in reference to my own experience.

It’s very likely the program will teach using one of the programs and I don’t think you can really do pre-study in one of them as each cost $$$ and require background knowledge in biostats.

Courses in biostats should start pretty basic anyway, as Masters students come from a wide variety of backgrounds.

Honestly, I don’t think there’s a lot you can do to prepare. At its easiest, biostats is simple maths you’ve done at primary school, and at its hardest, it’s so esoteric you probably don’t need to actually learn it (or it’s really hard to learn by yourself).
You’ll be taught more advanced things in other courses further down the track, but basic biostats starts off very basic.

You could, I suppose, watch some YouTube videos on the software above or basic biostats to just familiarise yourself.
Search stuff like “How to make histograms/scatter plots/etc. on STATA/R/SAS”.
Or google “What are 95% confidence intervals?” or “What are p values?”.

You might not understand them all (and that’s totally ok), but you’ll get inkling of what’s ahead.



And if you are familiar with any of the above, then you’ll be totally ok anyway.

Edit: oh, I just realised this was about admittance. In that case, you’ve got nothing to worry about. Getting into a MPH should be easy with your background experience."
publichealth,"Seconded. Your MPH thesis is more to showcase of your skills, not to fix the world."
publichealth,"applied to more than epidemiology, of course, but that's what I would (maybe mistakenly) consider pure public health research"

publichealth,Thank you! That's very helpful.
publichealth,"The U.S. government underpays highly qualified employees (and overpays lower-skilled employees).  To attract quality physicians, lawyers, economists, and public health leaders, the government should pay them more than the current salaries.  For example, it is very difficult for FDA to hire quality physicians because any freshly-minted physician out there can immediately make more money than the FDA Commissioner makes. "
publichealth,"I'll throw in 2 cents.  I think when people suggest that biostatistic degrees have some sort of exclusive domain, they're imagining something more along the lines of PhD level specialization, but really, for any job requiring just masters level stats work there really isn't an enormous gap between epi and biostats (MPHs) as far as formal training is concerned and it defaults more to relevant experience.  

That is, if the distinction was more along the lines of theoretical or data complexity, the MPH is already out of the conversation before we can discuss the finer points of Epi or Biostats as a specialization in an applied, generalist's degree.  Any person with considerable graduate training in applied statistics, which ""bio""statistics is by definition applied, really has equal footing.  I mean, realistically, if the difference between an epidemiologist and a biostatistician in the most advanced sense was just 2 or 3 course electives on sampling design or missing data methodology, and maybe they overlap, then what are we discerning? 

       
 "
publichealth,"About the same for the common core and smaller for department classes; I think 20 was probably the max for me, and my department (infectious disease epi) is the biggest MPH department at Yale, I think."
publichealth,"Hello! 

I may not be super helpful but I figured I’d offer my input in case you don’t get many other replies. I’m about to graduate from UA with my MPH so I may be biased lol. I don’t believe employers for public health positions, in general, care if you went to a top-tier school. I would avoid debt if I were you. Again that comes from personal bias. I will have a significant amount in student loans and I don’t mind because I’m going to be in a field that I find fulfilling. That doesn’t take away from the fact that I will be paying off those loans for some time. I would look more closely at the difference in curriculum and mentoring opportunities and go from there. I am also a firm believer that your education will be what you make it. If you put the work in, you’ll be successful at either school. Both epi and biostatistics have good jobs out there. I know because I’m currently looking for jobs and I wish I were better at math so I could’ve done one of those concentrations. 

Basically, I think you should go the less expensive route given you’re going into public health. "
publichealth,"Thanks for your advice, it's really interesting to look into people with certain medical conditions, however, ethically may be difficult for me to do research in that area.

By health communication, I mean between provider and patient, as well as non-health professional related communication. I'll look into the sources of health communication as a major aspect of the study."
publichealth,"I talked a lot to my brother about getting a dual JD/MPH. (He's a lawyer, doesn't work in public health at all). He basically talked me out of going to law school unless I wanted to practice as a lawyer/do litigation. It's a ton of extra debt, and if you're going to be not making any money post-graduation it doesn't make sense. I would say getting a certificate or degree in Health Policy would be better. What do you want to do? You can help to draft policy without being a lawyer. You can get a degree in policy and certificate in social epi, or vice versa. "

publichealth,"When you apply, admissions looks at your WHOLE body of work.  Your GPA is just one aspect of who you are. If you have had any academic issues, make sure to touch upon that slightly and talk about how you improved your grades (especially in your major) in your letter.  I personally had a shit GPA my first 2 years in UG but showed how I worked to increase my GPA every year after and how my GPA for my courses compared to my overall.  Honestly, your work experience looks great,  you probably have a lot of people beat in that aspect when applying.  Make sure to get strong letters of recc.  Reach out to professors and show how much interest/passion you have.  More often than not they'll write you one even if maybe there wasn't a close relation.  Professors are usually very supportive of people pursuing a professional degree. I'm also sure you can get some letters of recc from supervisors you've worked with given your extensive work experience"
publichealth,"Definitely apply! I think you'll get into nearly every school you apply to, but schools have different criteria for scholarships and grants. With your stats, you likely won't get anything at Columbia since they're very focused on applicant statistics in making those decisions. However, you will likely get a great aid package at BU, NYU, GW, and maybe even Yale, Emory, or Harvard, since they tend to look more at the total applicant than just stats. I'd recommend applying to quite a few schools then weighing your options!

Reference: Applied to 12 schools &amp; was accepted to all. Fell below Columbia's GRE cutoff and was told that's a hard line for scholarships, but was offered great aid from many of the schools listed above due to having a strong research and volunteer background. Will be attending Emory in the fall with 50% merit and money for work-study. :)"
publichealth,Not at all! Send over your questions!
publichealth,"Wow, this is a great resource! Thanks for sharing. "
publichealth,"I went for my MS in EOHS from a public school. I would ask the following questions if you haven’t already;

* do the schools offer traineeships from NIOSH or other state agencies? These often come with a monthly stipend that can cover living expenses and books if you’re frugal.

* Are graduate or teaching assistantships available to masters level students? Compensation for these positions is often an entire deduction of tuition plus a stipend.

I, personally, would suggest against an MPH or other capstone based degree. MS is recognizable by laypeople/HR and seems to demand more rigor (defended thesis instead of capstone)."
publichealth,"100% go for the MPH. So many people come into public health with diverse backgrounds and various degrees. Getting the MPH will help you stand out and receive more competitive pay than a second bachelor's degree. "
publichealth,"Lots of opportunities, but also *lots* of competition because there are so many schools in the area. I've heard the market is over-saturated, but was a few years ago so things may be better with the improved economy."

publichealth,"Is it highly requested to get an MPH? I’ve been thinking about it a lot but I’m leaning more towards working for a year or two first before committing myself to school again. Do you have any recommendations on what websites to use to find jobs, as well? "
publichealth,"Thank you for your advise. It's reassuring for sure. I think I will keep up with what I am doing volunteering and making extra at work. I do think that attending a few networking events sounds like a good idea. "
publichealth,Because too many actors within a private healthcare system stand to lose from a healthy society.
publichealth,"I guess my question is why public health and not law?  Public health is very abstract in the U.S.  For example, I practice in Pennsylvania, where you could be covered by either a county or municipal health department. If you happen to live somewhere without that kind of coverage, you are covered by the state. 

The issues arise when you look at the services delivered by the different entities. None are comparable; some give all, some give less. It’s a broken, fragmented system in my state. "
publichealth,"I worked part time for one year in ID surveillance and 1 year part time in research during my grad program, no other real research experience to speak of. I applied to maybe 25-30 jobs, got to the initial interview about half of the time and got call backs for a 2nd in about 5-6 cases. Accepted my job about 1 month after getting my degree. 

I can’t really say what to expect as a foreign in student in terms of how the visas work but several of my cohort members from overseas were able to get positions here in the states so it’s doable. I think if you’re concerned about employment, go to the associated career services department and have them help you with your resume/CV, cover letter, and interviewing skills. I went twice to mine for those topics and that really set me up for success with the interviewing process. I think the job market is pretty good given that you are willing to move to certain areas of the country, usually the coasts, and you know your stuff. The big thing is trying to get or having that work experience while in your program."
publichealth,"Meta analysis requires an initial systematic review. So st minimum you will be doing a systematic review, whether it's followed by meta analysis or not. "
publichealth,"I don't. I will occasionally engage a person with bizarre beliefs if I am doing an outreach clinic (vaccines, prophy, etc) but that is rarely effective. I will rarely (as in only a couple of times rare) message someone directly on Facebook (e.g. co-sleeping with an infant, grilling inside the house) but I intentionally make it a private message so the person will not feel so defensive and hopefully change their behaviors. Otherwise, no, I don't publicly argue with Facebook posts. "
publichealth,"I'm not in Canada, but in the U.S. there is an overabundance of MPH\-workers seeking the type of job you're interested in. Thus, it is very hard to get this type of experience without a masters, unless you find an NGO and travel wherever they send you."
publichealth,"Out of undergrad, (following 1 year of AmeriCorps) I applied to 60+ jobs.  Got 2 interviews, only 1 was public health the other was data entry for a lab. 

I worked full time in the field for 5 years and concurrently received an MPH and wanted to move up in my field.  I applied to 5 jobs, got 3 interviews.  I say this for all the posts to new grads.  Experience matters in this field.

I've never been to Oklahoma, but based on geographical location, and political climate, it's not surprising to me that the job outlook there is dim.  I would suggest more jobs are available on either coast. "
publichealth,"Cool. Information on the reports helps, want to make sure I'm not getting into writing reports that I'll hate (granted report writing isn't happy fun times usually) Thank you, again! This is all incredibly illuminating information. "
publichealth,"Thanks for your input, but I am very familiar with Hopkins and the admissions process specifically. As I mentioned in the guide, they will not take applications stating zero experience, but experience through volunteering in undergrad, working in public health programs during a single gap year, etc all count. A sizeable proportion of the cohort is out of undergrad. It is a false statement to think you need to work for two years in a public health job to apply to Hopkins, you just need to demonstrate prior experience in a similar area, leadership, preferably some research, and a strong mission statement."

publichealth,"It is not clear to me why you want to do JD/MPH based on your interests in social epidemiology, developmental disabilities etc.  My only advice is to clarify your interests before you take the plunge.  Did you consider working in these sectors?  For example, in the department of public health in your state or as a caseworker in developmental disabilities?  This short stint will allow you to finalize your next step.  Every field looks exciting from outside, as I know very well myself!"
publichealth,"My advice is for you to work for 2-3 years before starting grad school "
publichealth,"Counterpoint; CSPH

This. I've actually referenced T. R. Reid in papers in my MPH program. Still relevant nearly a decade on. It's free to stream online, and there's a transcript as well (but I recommend watching it)."
publichealth,"May I PM you some questions about the day-to-day experiences at your job? I'm a soon-to-be MPH graduate with a more qualitative background as well, but I'm interested in more analytical positions given the experience I've gotten through coursework and projects."
publichealth,"I had a similar situation, went to college right out of HS totally unmotivated, failed all my classes, and made up for it every semester when I went back a few years later. Point that out on your statement of purpose, don't hide it. Use it as an example of how you work hard or something. You'll be fine."
publichealth,"try to look early/look at the hard skills on the jobs that you are applying to and cater your resume to those, especially for county jobs. Utilize your connections during your MPH now"
publichealth,"There are levels to being a 'math' person. I'm heavily on the quantitative side, but still struggle to understand the mathematics underpinning disease dynamics, complicated multi-level surveys, etc. At any level, you should know what resources there are for help.

Unless you are interested in research, a competent field epidemiologist requires only basic arithmetic and algebra. In the MPH you should learn to understand and interpret the results of statistical tests, and be able to run a simple regression. See CDC's Field Epidemiologist Training Program for the basic competencies taught in most countries."
publichealth,"&gt;One of the points behind it was that the agency was not able to get these people unless they paid under Title 42,” Mr. Noble said. “It seems somewhat incongruous to have someone who’s been trying to get the job for many years to be paid under it. The C.D.C. has to show that it had to do so to get him, and that it needed him for the job.”

Still asking good questions, especially under the Republican run Executive and Congressional administrations we are under now, who typically say we should be reducing government spending. This looks a bit like another example of that being bullshit.  It might have nothing to do with that but it sure looks bad."
publichealth,"In public health, an MPH is considered an entry level degree. It'll be hard to find volunteer positions practicing basic public health competencies. I wouldn't consider volunteering as a necessary experience for an application, your work experience in research is sufficient. 

Nevertheless, If you are looking to improve your application competitiveness, look for volunteer positions in health advocacy or in providing assistance to marginalized populations. This could include shelters, patient navigators, mobile clinics, needle exchange, counseling, etc. A position which demonstrates your drive to help others. 

If you're looking to gain an understanding of the field, the health department is the best place to look for volunteering positions. Health departments in my area also have hourly work for data entry on a flexible schedule."
publichealth,"Just wanted to agree with the person above. Biostatistics will give you more flexibility than epidemiology. You can likely still take a lot of epi courses to count towards your degree even if you concentrate in biostats. That's what I did anyway, and I think having hard skills like SAS and data analysis has greatly increased my job prospects. "
publichealth,"There was someone on here who loves BU, but I’ll give you the other side of it: I hate BUSPH. Everyone here comes from money (I don’t) and it’s so hypocritical to talk about poverty when no ones doing anything about the people sitting in their own classes.

The program is difficult and a gigantic think tank, no actual practice. The South End of Boston is trash and so is the public transportation. When you tell people you’re struggling financially, they roll their eyes at you.

I’m also in the Community Assessment track, and I’m not learning anything compared to my experience as an undergraduate public health student. This program is not worth the debt.

I will say that the tuition remission is hard to come by those jobs, but the program is so difficult that you wouldnt even want to concurrently work full time and take a class because it’ll be super stressful. I’m personally taking a leave of absence and planning on finding a full time job and then deciding if I want to complete the degree or not, because it has completely made me lose my passion for public health.

Feel free to pm me if you have any questions!"
publichealth,"Reddit hates it when you say anything negative about vaping. Yeah, it's a great harm reduction strategy *for people who are deliberately trying to kick the habit.* However those folks are a *minority* of users.

publichealth,"Don’t bank of the public service loan forgiveness program though! It’s got bipartisan support but you never know who could get rid of it. 

Also don’t quote me on this but I think BU is a better program. "
publichealth,"Yes, this would be a bachelors degree. It says on the CEPH website that the school has applied to accredit the BS program. I'm thinking that a program which is accredited is stronger vs one that isn't?"

publichealth,"Yeah, I'm pretty frustrated by that. I guess my question is how do I show employers I'm very serious about moving wherever the job is? "
publichealth,"Have you been calling, or just emailing? Call the admissions office. Call the international student office (who is probably actually  who is processing anything related to the I20). This is the busiest time of year for admissions offices and phone calls will get a quicker response. Going above the admissions director’s head is not going to make you any friends in that office, though might get a quicker response, but I’d save that as a last resort."
publichealth,"So I hold a [PMI-ACP](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/agile-acp) and am about to get my [PMP](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/project-management-pmp) later this year. I'm also an MPH student.

It doesn't take much to set oneself up as a project management trainer. Basically, anyone can just say, ""I know all about project management"" and teach away. One way to avoid this is to go with the leading organization for PM training and certification, [PMI](https://www.pmi.org). Even with no experience, you can take 23 hours of training from an approved PMI training provider and sit for a [CAPM](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/certified-associate-capm) (Certified Associate in Project Management) exam. Not only will you learn a fair amount, but you'll have a real credential. Moreover, if you decide you need to dive in more, you can then make a decision about whether you want to go down the traditional waterfall PM path (PMP) or whether you want to focus on Agile (PMI-ACP)—and CAPM would feed right into either or both of those. I'm going to guess the former, but it depends on your situation.

publichealth,"CDC is tough right now due to the budget and lingering hiring freezes/restrictions. You might be able to get a one year ORISE fellowship (as you're within 5 years of graduation IIRC).

Have you checked Emory's Public Health Employment Connection? They might have some contractor positions at Carter Consulting, etc. Otherwise, I'd recommend looking at Glassdoor and LinkedIn as well."
publichealth,"This maybe a more complicated question to answer on here.  My advice for you would be to go to a financial aid or graduate program adivsor and talk about your situation.  If you have absolutely no $$, there is no other option than to take out the max loan to cover tuition (plus thinking about living expenses as well).  I don't know if you have the option to think about it any other way again with your financial situation you stated.  I wouldn't look like, what is the max loans I should take out for it to most benefit me with your situation.

But, I do know a biostatistics degree will pay you more compared to other tracks.  The paying off 'x' amount in 'x' years is a whole different conversation.  That is all personal financing.  It will depend on so many factors (Pay, where you live, food costs, car loans, etc... ) that there probably isn't a good answer I can give you.  You'll probably have a decent salary 55k+ (out of the program) depending where  you work, the repayment is probably all up to what you can afford to pay back and how fast YOU want to."
publichealth,"I had a visiting class by Kawachi, was a bit disappointing, tbh— most of what he talked about was in his textbook anyway. That said, it’s not my specialty, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

The impression I get is that it’s a field which is very relevant, but almost tapped out. I come from the social sciences before my MPH in epi and social epi struck me as an application of behavioral econ to health and testing. It’s almost like academic arbitrage— most insights are couched in sociological and economic jargon/ academic circles being translated via new studies to epi. 

It’s a great experience to take a course in it because it teaches you to be grounded in the context not just platonic ideals of universally relevant exposures. But as a distinct field, it may be tapped out soon. Especially since pub health is now more interdisciplinary with collabs, they could hire an economist or an anthropologist (as is the practice in the WHO) instead. 

Do your own research into whether you feel it’s suitable to concentrate in it— it might be that I’m not inspired by it and simply can’t see the potential for research/ development.

That said, if you do want to get into it, go straight for the top: Kawachi. It’s a narrow field, so go for broke or nothing at all.

publichealth,"In my experience, heroin makes people really drowsy and they kinda stumble around, looking like they can't stay awake while meth makes people jittery and more aggressive. Meth also gives users this weird, wet cough? (Though not sure if this is also happens with IV users) I also think meth use comes with skin picking while heroin doesn't.

I have a family member that uses both on and off and that's the behavior we've kind of noticed. "

I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here. The two articles you've linked are unrelated and don't provide any evidence to your point. 

There's [enough](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199710233371706#t=article) [evidence](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/155/3/210/63367) out there to prove being black is not the problem, it's being black *in America* that's the problem.

Of course we can't absolutely prove that it's racism. Really though, these ""But, but, genetics!"" arguments are grasping at straws.

&gt; Non-Hispanic Blacks are 2x as likely as whites to have a teenage pregnancy.

Do you even hear yourself? You're actually trying to say that black people have increased rates of adolescent pregnancy because of the color of their skin? 

&gt; Lifestyle, **environment**, and culture are also predisposing factors in addition to genetics.

The environment we're talking about includes racism. I really don't understand how you're saying these things and coming to a completely different conclusion. 

Now that I've written this all out and noticed you probably believe the author was saying the medical community is racist, I'm pretty sure you didn't even read the article.

The title of your post and quotes from the article suggest otherwise. Fact is, race is a very useful heuristic in medical differential diagnosis and it would be negligent to ignore it. 

&gt; Seriously, you're a dentist. Full of yourself much?

A dentist who took the same basic science and clinical medicine/pathology courses with the medical students at our university, who also completed a residency in hospital medicine. I'm a dentist who works in community health with primarily African American and Hispanic populations. But sure, what do I know. A dentist can look at a panorex and predict its a middle age AA woman just from the presentation of osseous dysplasia, or predict that an AA child will have maxillary prognathism and diastema relative to his/her peers, more likely to have sleep disordered breathing but also less likely to require orthodontics, and knows that an extraction on an African American will be more difficult than other races due to density of bone. None of that is racism - those are clinical heuristics from race which hold true time and time again.  You can be contrarian all you want, but providers in the trenches see race and know what morbidities are associated with it. The hubris is from public health scientists who sit behind a desk and don't actually treat patients, but seek to express that they know more about medicine than people who, you know, actually studied it and have a license to practice it. Full of yourself much?"
publichealth,"It really depends on what you want to do with the degree.   If you want to do research or consulting, then it matters very much."
publichealth,"I agree it can matter but then again it will never matter as much as your accomplishments. You want to consult, maybe in data matters? Build a website, display your results and it will be better received than where your degree is from. And for most higher up research positions you need a phd anyway and then you can still get into some well regarded schools. 

All I am saying is, relax you will be ok. 

The whole grades system will never be as important as it feels right now in your head. You want to impress people you do it with your actions. Volunteer in your field of interest and leave an impact. Showcase your data skills. If anyone ever wants to disregard you because of a grade, proof them wrong.

publichealth,"I graduated a few years ago, but at the time, UNC SPH would give grad students in-state tuition for their 2nd year as long as they switched everything (license, car, bank address, etc.) to their NC address as soon as they moved down for year 1.

If you're looking to go into consulting or government, name recognition of your school will matter less than if you were looking to get hired in the general private market. I say this because consulting firms are looking for bright people with a few core skills and they'll train you on the details and UNC is good enough that you're not fighting to convince them that you're smart. And federal government HR literally doesn't look at where your degree is from; it's all about the boxes you check in terms of prior experience.

For both consulting and government, the intern experiences you will get will matter much more than the difference between UNC and JHSPH's names. I would talk to both programs and see what types of places they have students go for internships and specifically ask them about alumni in consulting positions."

publichealth,"Fair enough on the central data! And ill admit the focus in bc is overdose.   But pharma doesn't just identify people who are prescribed opioids. It could tell you what proportion of people with opioid use disorder that have accessed OAT in the past, are still alive and not on it now (and since it's relapsing AND evidence for long term abstinence shows ?~3% get there, that's a key population).  Or people on OAT, but at doses that aren't consistent with guidelines (including tapers).  Or people who stop/start/stop/start. All those put someone at risk for overdose. 

Going upstream to find people using substances problematically but never linked to treatment - thats much harder, absolutely. "
publichealth,"That's because it's hard to measure racism. I think if you read that black people face increased odd or relative risks of a certain disease and that offends you, you need to go back through your stats notes. 

No one is saying it's a black person genetics that makes them more prone to diabetes. There are host of factors going on here, environmental, social, economic and racial bias. "

No one is suggesting it is ""simply racism dismissing a litany of other genetic, cultural, environmental, socioeconomic and behavioral factors."" Just that racism is one of them, and we need to start talking about it and addressing it. 

No one is arguing that there aren't any genetic influences in health outcomes. But it doesn't explain it all, and neither do the other factors we already study and to continue to argue that is ridiculous. 

No where does the author claim racism is the *only* factor, just that it **is** a factor. Right now, no one lists it as a risk factor at all, her argument is to start acknowledging it as a risk factor and to incorporate it into public health goals. 

We don't know the exact balance between genetics, socioeconomic, individual behaviors, physical or social environment (ie racism), just that it's a mix of everything. And in terms of maternal health, we know genetics does not play a huge role. There's too much data to even begin to claim otherwise.

Side note: Some white people have sickle cell because it literally has absolutely nothing to do with being black, it's about exposure to malaria. There are millions of African/black people who don't have sickle cell risk factors, especially in southern Africa. I'd say ""read links below,"" but I doubt you'll do that. We see a lot of sickle cell among black people in the US because they come from malaria endemic regions. Ya know, remember slavery?

Different hematocrit levels? It's [economic disparities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/537117)

Slimmer pelvises? Yea, that's probably genetic. Doesn't explain a ton of maternal health outcomes that are aren't birth-related, like tearing or risk of requiring C-section. And genetics certainly doesn't explain all of those either. 


And no, I'm not a clinician, but the fact that you're using that as an argument speaks for itself. Seriously, you're a dentist. Full of yourself much? I'm not sure how much training you got in maternal health, I'm guessing very little. This is why it's frustrating when medical providers with no training in public health try to wave around their letters as if they're worth more than anyone else's letters.

publichealth,"I was admitted to the same program (Hopkins GDEC) for this year and chose another program since I personally felt like the Hopkins career center was weak. Students didn't seem to know much about it at the visit day and did most of their own networking, which is fine but not what I was looking for. I'll be at Emory instead since they gave me a large scholarship and had a wonderful career center (plus I loved the area and felt like I could be happy there). What do you need from a graduate degree?"
publichealth,"Their search methodology for jobs looks pretty rigorous. They find there were *87* entry-level GH jobs globally over a 6-month period. They also suggest many of these are not real postings. If those numbers plus $50k (or whatever) in debt look good to you, please by all means go for a top-flight school. I have no dog in this fight."
publichealth,"Do NOT go into debt for an MPH/MSPH! 

And I'd even recommend against anything Global Health-y: there are essentially no jobs: https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12889-018-5195-1

Finally, you may have a *slight* leg up in getting your first job coming from Hopkins, but only slight as JHU graduates HUNDREDS a year.  And any income differences will be non-existent."
publichealth,"UA publishes their data for 1 year post graduation, at which point 92% of MPH grads are employed or pursuing further education.  They didn't publish the data for individual concentrations but I would imagine Biostats would be on the better end. 

I think I could find a job with that degree, and even if its not immediate, I could support myself on something temporary without having to worry about loan payments.  

Also, I thought public health jobs were growing fast? Is the job market really that bad?"
publichealth,"It probably depends on where your interests lie and where you prefer to work after graduating (west coast/east coast). UCLA and Berkeley (the latter especially) have excellent public health programs no less (perhaps more!) recognized than Yale's, and are ideally located for epi careers. Ultimately, the quality of your work and your skill level will be more important than the name on your degree. I was admitted to both Yale and Berkeley and while I attended a different school, of the two I found Berkeley strongly preferable. I would look at the programs' faculty - who do you want to work with in terms of faculty? Does one program offer coursework or training opportunities that another does not? What populations do you want to serve/do research with? Are those populations represented in New Haven/LA/the bay area? As an Ivy League grad, I can tell you the prestige has its perks but it's way more important that the program you attend aligns with your interests and provides the training and exposure you'll need to be good at your job. "
publichealth,"Definitely check out if your local library offers free access to Lynda.com or any other online classes. (For example, in Los Angeles, we have the following: https://www.lapl.org/collections-resources/e-media)

To organize your thoughts/projects, check out Trello or Notion. Good luck, you've got this. "
publichealth,"I can, I realized I sort of ranted. My apologies. My question is, what should I do in my gap year to not only improve my resumé, but be able to give back to the community to help improve the lives of others?"
publichealth,Nope.
publichealth,Always choose an accredited program
publichealth,"What do you do now? How do you think the MSW would have helped you in your career? "
publichealth,"You forgot to mention meetings and committees.  Endlessly, meetings and committees.  "
publichealth,"I mean I wasn’t really talking about instincts or insights. Just that with biostats if you focus on taking some Epi methods courses as your electives and make sure thesis and practicum are more epi focused then you could apply to basically all the jobs an Epi mph could. But no matter how many biostats courses or how much biostats ability or experience you have, there will be opportunities you cannot pursue with an Epi mph that are exclusive to biostats. I have had multiple biostats professors talk in lecture about how they have had people ask for a reference for an Epi student and they warned the person that “they are good at statistics, but the are not a biostatistician”. Also if you try to apply to a job as a statistician or data scientist as an Epi major then good luck. But with biostats those positions are a possibility. 

Instinct and thought process don’t really matter in the job application process. I mean I’m an Epi major and I definitely lean more towards the numbers side of things when it comes to insights and thought processes. "
publichealth,"You should start by getting a part-time research job while you're in school. It's hard enough to get a full-time, permanent job after graduation and not working part-time in the field while you're in school is only making that harder.

And job vs internship is an important distinction because the mere act of getting paid for your work provides credibility to your time spent in that job (vs an unpaid internship where they'll typically keep you on even if you're bad at the job as long as you're trying and learning)."
publichealth,"Subbed! "
publichealth,"I post this a lot: The Reddit rule is usually pick the cheapest CEPH accredited program unless it's Top 8-10.  Since Boston is right one the cusp, I'd pick the better fit. Which school has more researchers working in an area you're interested in? "
publichealth,"Im in the same boat! Deciding on two MPH degrees, except one is CAHME and CEPH accredited. The other is just CEPH. I feel that if you want to do hospital administration, the CAHME accredited is probably best... You say you only want to ""work"" in a hospital however, so the MPH should be fine. "
publichealth,"I have an MPH, not an MHA so take my advice with a grain of salt.

Personally, unless you already have mid-level or  management experience, i wouldn’t do a program that doesn’t require and support internships. To advance in career and salary, you’re going to need actual work experience. "
publichealth,I suggest speaking with a few administrators in your area. Environment changes the experience. Also you may look into an MBA program and concentrate in healthcare - this is what I did. Either way you will learn management science and how to apply it to leading healthcare organizations.
publichealth,"If you're interested in working with people and aren't having much luck on the job hunt, Americorps (regular or VISTA) is a pretty easy way to get public health or at least social service experience.

In terms of all your other questions, it just depends. Jobs with the ""public"" pay the worst (may start below $30k). Consulting pays the most (will start above $45k).  Normal office jobs are in between. Non-profits pay less than for-profits. Add $5-7K to those estimates for large cities.

And whether you should get the MPH sooner rather than later depends on what you're doing in between. The best is to get 2-5 years of relevant(ish) experience before your MPH, but getting your MPH immediately after undergrad is not unheard of and it better than working a dead-end, unrelated job just because. I did my MPH straight away and the only problem is that lots of positions want an MPH plus a few years of experience, which most people get before their MPH so I was declined by HR a bunch of times for essentially being too young even when I had the right degree and was fully capable of doing the duties of the position."
publichealth,"Hey thanks! I've looked into Trello but not Notion. Great idea about the library I will check that out! "
publichealth,"My health dept is always looking for surveillance nurses!

I manage a team of health educators for a statewide program right now.  I'm only a few years out of completing my MPH but when I was looking for jobs some that I was interested in required experience/ training that I would have gotten through an MSW.  There was one position in particular that was clearly a PH position but everyone else at the organization has a MSW background and they seemed partial to this (I think this was to their detriment because in talking with them I noticed there were some key PH components that they were missing). Overall, I think having an MSW will just open more doors and give you more experience to draw from.  "

publichealth,"I personally enjoy working and volunteering in my own community. My community has a local health advocacy non-profit with committees. We also have an active United Way with committees that work towards health. There are also plenty of non-profits focusing on food insecurity and health education. It really depends on your location, but there's usually something. While this isn't major, cutting edge public health work, it's service in the field of public health. I personally find it's fulilling to help translate what I learned in my MPH to local community agencies who can apply it to practice. "
publichealth,"Find and email the associate dean for finance or the director of finance if you don't get a response after the spring break. "
publichealth,"Personally, I'd suggest not paying for a school you don't want.  It's expensive, both in time and money.

You can take GRE math prep courses, but you need to understand the material.  It may be worthwhile to invest in a full on semester long math course at a community college.  My biostatistics professor in grad school hated doing algebra, she told us it never really clicked for her and that statistics felt different enough for her to feel comfortable.  Which was pretty cool to hear out of somebody with a PhD in biostatistics!

I'd also invest on yourself regarding your communication skills.  No matter where you go or what you do, verbal communication is hugely important.  A public speaking class will not be fun, but it might help you build some comfort behind a podium!"

OP—apply! Follow your passion. I bet you’ll be surprised—these programs evaluate you as a whole person, not a single test score. 

Edit: words "
publichealth,"thanks. I'm just having a meltdown right now. But in a reassuring way, I know that I'm done beating around the bush. 

I spoke to a Columbia professor. She says I'd be a great candidate, but she didn't know my GPA (fml right). 

Regarding each role I listed: yes, I wanted leave it vague online. But on my resume, it's more descriptive. I'll do my best on the GRE. I'm going to start studying again.

I am 100% going to apply. I have some time.

publichealth,"Just to confirm, you're trying to get a job that eventually focuses on nutrition, right?  Veganism is one of those topics (like crossfit or whatever) that people are very interested about, but I would wager there aren't many jobs that would have you communicating about veganism.

Veganism is one of those things that people have strong feelings about, and unless you're trying to get a job directly related to it, I would caution you to focus on something more broadly applicable, like diabetes or obesity.  Perhaps talking about the linkages between the two.  Just so it's not apparent that you're doing an investigation on something you personally really have a thing for, as I think hiring managers (unless they are vegans too, or the job is at some sort of vegan messaging council) would think that your real interest is in that, and not in whatever they're actually hiring for.

TLDR:  Think of what your potential job interviews would look like, and what your career goals are.

"
publichealth,"University health systems generally have lots of entry level administrative positions and it isn't unusual for people to be enrolled in degree programs, which would at least increase your opportunity for networking and commiserating. "
publichealth,"Congrats! That’s great, I’m sure you will enjoy it there. Good luck :)"
publichealth,"For what it's worth, I wish I had done a dual as opposed to just the MPH (actually thinking of adding an MSW).  1- yes I think you should be able to stay on the PH side of things 2- I think this would be more program specific.  The programs you're looking into should have this info 3- I can't say specifically but in general there are a lot of options in this field, it might depend more on your concentrations and types of internships.

publichealth,"&gt; We—in health, advocacy, and media—need to stop saying and teaching that being Black is a risk factor for illness and death ... we need to start telling the truth: It’s exposure to racism that is the risk factor.

I get the author's sentiment, but race is absolutely a predisposing factor for complications in pregnancy and maternal mortality. It's simply ignorant to suggest otherwise. AA women are at higher risk of [preeclampsia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4171100/) and are more prone to enter pregnancy with hypertension. Pacific Islanders and Hispanics are at higher risk for developing [gestational diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4180530/). White women have wider pelvises on average than women of African descent; fistula is historically far more common in black women simply due to anatomy and physiology. Non-Hispanic Blacks are 2x as likely as whites to have a teenage pregnancy. Lifestyle, environment, and culture are also predisposing factors in addition to genetics. The Jewish community is also at risk for several genetic diseases. Are we to believe it's because the medical community is anti-Semitic? The author is an OB-GYN. She should know better. "
publichealth,"Yup! From what I've heard, as far as using EHRs to track ODs consistently, it all comes down to the diagnosis code selected and that can be a tough call given the information you have. That's mostly a human diagnosis issue, not a bioinformatics issues."

3) You'll be closer to friends and family. 
4) Yale is not ranked all that high for their public degrees. UCLA and Berkely are 9 &amp; 10 whereas Yale is #14 on the US News and Reviews for Graduate Public Health Schools. "
publichealth,"[I'm an MPH student at a UK university, studying via distance.]

A reasonable source of university rankings is the [QS World University Rankings](https://www.topuniversities.com). (Other ranking systems exist; this is the one with which I'm most familiar.) For more specificity, you could look at QS World's [subject rankings for life sciences](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/life-sciences-medicine).

A few observations, in no particular order:

* English is commonly used in graduate programs around the world, so you won't have a problem with that.
* The US has some outstanding public health schools (Johns Hopkins, Harvard, UNC Chapel Hill, U of Washington), but as a European, you might find tuition to be, shall we say, shocking. (On the other hand, you said you have wealthy parents.) You can't go wrong with any of the top five or six schools on [this list](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/public-health-rankings).
* If you can get into (and can afford) one of the top 10 schools on the QS life sciences list, do it.
* Keep in mind that a number of top public health schools offer distance learning programs, so where you reside may not be the same as where you study. (Edinburgh and Chapel Hill definitely do; I think Johns Hopkins has a mostly-distance program.) You're not going to find a world-class public health school in India, but maybe you don't have to."

publichealth,I would go for Berkeley or UCLA. The extra expense of Yale isn't worth it given you got into extremely solid programs. Take methods-based classes and you'll be fine and just as competitive in the job market. Honestly there are a lot of well educated graduates of great programs all vying for positions that aren't paid well. And I say this after working in international health and having a top tier degree. Why spend the extra amount when you got into two excellent and reputable schools? I'd say go to Yale only if your other options were poor programs but you have great options!

publichealth,Hey there! I'm getting my MPH now in epi with a huge passion for mental health (psychiatric epidemiology). Feel free to PM me with any questions you have!
publichealth,"I think it depends on where you plan to look for jobs afterwards. Honestly, I imagine the only area where Yale might be an advantage is in Connecticut (where you'd be more likely to be competing with other Yale grads), or perhaps the CDC. Otherwise, I'm a firm believer in saving thousands of dollars because the name of your school does not mean anything compared to the experience and education you receive. 

For what it's worth I chose a lower ranked school for financial reasons and don't regret it one bit. Like you said, I don't think the public health field is very name-conscious in general. "
publichealth,"Most of social epidemiology is contained in academia. Aside from policy, there are health departments and philanthropic foundations (e.g. RWJF) concerned monitoring and improving health equity, meaning lessening inequalities in health by race, income, sexual orientation, etc. This work is closely linked to social epi."

publichealth,Thanks so much!

My hometown is more rural and has also been messed up by opioids - it started with people smoking oxy and now heroin and fentanyl. I don't see any signs of it slowing down soon."
publichealth,Did you earn your MPH in epidemiology or in a less quantitative discipline?

publichealth,"Depends on what you want to do. If you're working purely on the business side of a hospital, the MHA (or an MBA) is enough. But you'll have to clarify what you mean by working in a ""clinical setting"" and what you think an MHA would help you do with patients."

Schools like Emory, George Washington, Minnesota, Boston, even Johns Hopkins can be more of a chance if you prove your passion and alignment of your goals with their program. 

I got into Emory with a 3.1 gpa,  gre of 156 156 5.0 , and a little volunteer experience and some data  analyst positions.

And to be fair Emory is top 5 by many standards simply because of networking, connections, and practical experience through the CDC.   I’ve heard good stories of people 2.9 GPAs at even JHU, but don’t think you absolutely have to go to Columbia. (Unless it’s waaaaay cheaper)
"
publichealth,"I'm in PH, and live in the Boston area. What kind of PH job are you looking for? There is some competition, but I think there's also huge variation depending on the type of PH job you are looking for (like in many places)."
publichealth,"Oh wow I was debating between these 2 exact programs. I ended up going for JHU because I have no full-time health policy experience and think the 9-month internship will allow me to have that experience before graduating. I also preferred JHU's easy access to D.C for policy-related internships. 

In terms of academics, Hopkins is on a quarter system, not semester. You'll be getting as many courses/credits as a typical 2-year program. I wouldn't worry about being disadvantaged. Yes, the quarter system is more fast-paced, but if you were accepted then they're confident you'll be able to handle that fast-paced academic rigor.

I visited both schools and felt ""at home"" in both(maybe a bit more at UNC tbh). I You really can't go wrong with either program. With cost and strength of program being equal, go with your gut feeling, not what others expect from you."

publichealth,"Did you end up applying by chance? "
publichealth,"Thank you for replying!  That's good to hear that you think schools look for people, not just numbers.  I was a little worried about keeping up top scores in every class and then taking on the GRE this summer.  I have roughly another year before applying, but I am always checking blogs and such to try and get more of an insight into the field and the application process. 

I am thinking of applying to Michigan, Ohio State, University of Cincinnati, Pitt, and others around the midwest area.  I'm not too worried about getting into the best of the best, just a solid program that offers the MS in biostatistics.

publichealth,"I got accepted into Michigan and South Carolina this winter and just a couple days ago opted to accept the offer for South Carolina. Michigan while being a amazing school would have put me in an incredible amount of debt if I didn’t land some good assistantships and scholarships. South Carolina on the other hand is a very good school and my undergrad advisor had connections there so they were very interested in me and some promising funding opportunities may occur. The name of the school you went to may get your foot in the door a little easier on occasion but it won’t get you the job in the end. "
publichealth,"There are programs that don't require the GRE. The trade off is that you need experience in the field for ~2-4 years.

University of Indiana-Bloomington and University of Louisville are both CEPH-accredited programs that you may want to look into."
publichealth,"I didn't have student loans from undergrad. "
publichealth,"They are fairly similar in terms of coursework, but epidemiology is more focused on disease etiology and risk (disease detectives, if you will), whereas biostatistics is more about data management and analysis and potentially a little more emphasis on programming. Biostatistics will likely have better/higher paying job outlook but you'll be stuck behind a computer more. In epidemiology, there's more of a field work aspect to the work if you want, or you can also be stuck behind a computer all day if that's what you're into. "
publichealth,"Public heath programs don’t care much about gpa, 3.3 is plenty high even for the top programs. What’s important to them is your “story”.

Prescription data alone is incredibly powerful when you start looking at who is vulnerable to overdose (ie: using substances other than cannabis) in a contaminated environment like BC, but it has to be more integrated than ""x number of people are on methadone"". The denominator is key to know who is using substances but absent from treatment and care/ support. Thats what's hard, but it can at least be estimated.  "

publichealth,Do you think getting a bachelors in nursing to get clinical experience prior to an MPH would help or is it overkill?
publichealth,"Depending on what you do in public health, Boston is probably the second or third-best market for public health in the country.

If you are in epi/biostats, Atlanta is probably better due to the CDC headquarters, but I'd say Boston is number two behind Atlanta for that kind of work due to the university, pharma/biotech, and hospital presence.

If you are in health policy, DC is obviously the top spot, but I'd argue Boston is tied for number two in the US for health policy alongside NYC.There are a large number of health policy-related consulting and research firms with offices in the area, a number of non-profits, and of course the large university presence. Boston also has the advantage of being the state capital, so there are many opportunities with MA state government, or in firms that do consulting work for the MA state government. In many other states, the capital is in some second-tier city in the middle of the state, so you don't have the state gov't presence in the major cities. There are also some federal regional-level offices in the area.

For global health, again DC is probably better, and maybe NYC, but Boston actually has a large number of internationally focused NGOs with offices or HQs here.

For health management, Boston is a great market due to the large number of top hospitals, and many health management consulting firms are located here as well."
publichealth,"I believe overall, public health schools are becoming less selective because there are so many MPH programs now. So you may have a strong chance where ever you apply. If you are interested in working on the environmental and occupational health issues prevalent in New Orleans and Louisiana, I'd recommend LSU New Orleans School of Public Health. It is a small state school but there are opportunities to work on lead in drinking water, coastal restoration, emergency response, etc. It being a smaller school there are lots of paid student opportunities available on campus and the faculty are happy to connect you to their colleagues of similar interests. Source: LSU Environmental Health grad. The faculty connected me multiple people so that I had a great summer fellowship and multiple job offers after graduation. "
publichealth,"Thank you so much for sharing your story. I know that U of M is one of the top schools for public health. I wish you much success as you start school.

It's hard to though as most epi positions are very bio heavy.  I find that more ""health equity or minority health"" positions within gov't uses social epi more."
publichealth,"I recommend you try to intern with an epidemiologist at your county or state department of health. while doing that, take classes at your local community college on statistics and data analysis. All in all, this venture may take you about one year to three years, but will help you figure out if you want to do field epi and also bolster your credentials to the point where grades won't hold you back so much. this will also be cheaper and more effective than an online program (i think the only ones i trust are hopkins, berkeley, and gw and those are all expensive). this might also help you build more intuition for math on the gre."

That said, I'm banking on the idea that post-MPH, my combination of PM qualifications and MPH will be a big selling point."

I'll look into the employment connection though! "
publichealth,"I’m a BUSPH alumni who just graduated in January. I don’t think anyone can tell you how much is too much as everyone is different and not knowing your financial circumstances no one can say. 
I think some factors to consider when choosing a program or an mph are: 
-what jobs are you looking for once you graduate and what the salary ranges are
-what your projected salary could be as your career progresses 
-there are plenty of calculators out there to see how long it will take to pay off the loans. Are you okay with paying something like 300-500 dollars per month for the next 10-20 years. (On a side note lots of mph jobs can qualify for public service forgiveness) 
-talk with the schools see if they can offer you any more financial aid or see if there are scholarships. BU does offer tuition remission for employees but those positions are few and very hard to come by at BU. 

If you think it might be too expensive, see if you can defer a year and go work for a year to save up. 

Personally for me, even though my mph was primarily financed with loans (BU also gave me some decent scholarships), I have no regrets and would do it again in a heartbeat. I love BU and their MPH program is fantastic and well organized. 

If you have any more questions you’re more than welcome to PM me! "
publichealth,"1. It depends what you want to do long term. If you're going after a competitive position, then yes, it matters. If not, then don't worry about it. 
2. Personally, I think an MHA is better for management than an MPH. 
3. Helpful hint - some states report salaries for all employees. For instance in Texas, all state employees have their salaries publicly reported (e.g., MD Anderson Cancer Center). Use LinkedIn and these state databases to find out how much people are marking. Going from an undergrad PH to MHA, I doubt you'll land 70k out of school, but it's possible. 
4. Learn something else concurrently with your MHA. I strongly recommend CAPM certification or a CQIA. Figure out ways to take on additional responsibility now. Network with your senior leaders now. Volunteer to sit on various committees if possible. Read books on patient experience, operations management, QI, etc. 
5. You don't need a fellowship after graduation. You need to figure out how to network with the current leadership at your hospital. Take on additional responsibilities when you can. 
6. The easiest way is to advance is in your hospital now. 

A few other thoughts:

- You never mentioned what you want to do long term. Because you don't have a clinical background, you're limited in a certain capacity in how you advance in your hospital. It's not impossible, just difficult. If I were you, I'd learn project management skills. An MHA paired up with a PMP is currently highly marketable. 

- If it were me, I'd get the online MHA. The networking/experience from your MHA education will help you land your first and/or second positions. However, as time goes on, advancements will come from networking connections you develop after school. "

She had the option to accept or decline based on that information.
Once again, not sure what centers offer this. Hers was UPMC Presbyterian in Pittsburgh.

publichealth,"Not at all. "
publichealth,"I am a recent JHU grad. Don't worry about the experience requirement. Plenty of fresh undergraduates get into the MPH program. You can spin almost anything into experience, including your work at the health department. Passion driven a good backstory and mission statement will go far.

The entry level math skills aren't overly important to get in, but beware, understanding, conducting, and interpreting statistics is a huge part of a good Epi program."
publichealth,"Do you have any preference where you want to work after your MPH?  If you want to stay in CA, then go to UCLA or Berkeley.  Programs tend to have stronger networks with organizations close by.  For example, if you want to work for CMS or public health organizations in the DC area, then Johns Hopkins is a good choice."

publichealth,"I did do a certificate program, specifically one on Outcomes Research. That's because I wanted to study Epidemiology specifically when I got my MPH and the courses in that certificate were all Epi and Biostats focused. Plus math was a weakness of mine so I thought this was a low stakes way of proving I could perform at the grad school level. 

I also got tuition reimbursement from my job which ultimately pushed me towards doing it. So personally, the less financial risk the more I think it's worth it. But if money is not a problem for you, then go for it! "
publichealth,"My bachelors is in public health, I'm fully aware of what the field entails. Why do you think I visit this sub.

And I'm bashing public health scientists because you're a prime example of dismissing clinicians as not having a nuanced perspective into this discussion. Whatevs, you do you. I'm done. "
publichealth,"I honestly felt the same way. The official study guide was constructed terribly and was very inadequate. I too felt like I was going to fail the exam ( fortunately for me due to when I started my MPH, I just needed to sit for the exam, not pass it), but passed it. I’m just glad the school I attended paid for the first test. "

I'm down to read anything that you think is interesting. Just looking for a good read and something that can expand my horizons a bit."
publichealth,"WoW! Congratulations. This gives me hope.

If you don't mind me asking, were you working prior to applying to grad school and if so what field were you working in? I am finding that even with my bachelors without experience it's difficult to get a field epidemiologist job."
publichealth,"Thank you!

The interesting thing is I am great in statistics. I received a surprisingly high grade in my college statistics course.

The other thing is I've looked at the job duties for the position I want and there is really no math required, it's mostly communication and organization."
publichealth,"I had similar concerns before choosing the UConn MPH program. The major reason was because Yale’s MPH program is really research-oriented, and i was looking for more of a community and social/behavioral focus. I realized the Yale name wouldn’t be worth it (for me). Hope that is a little helpful!"
publichealth,"You don't really use math in public health. The most mathy thing is statistics which really isn't really math (for the most part unless you go further into statistics.)

As an epidemiologist, you'll also want to learn about statistics but it won't be too bad even if you're bad at math. 

Don't give up btw, you can do it. "
publichealth,"Does your friend at Mac like it? How do you like McGill? I’m doing my undergrad at McGill "
publichealth,Delaware!
publichealth,"I think that, if you have the math aptitude for it, biostats would be the better of the two. I think, and someone correct me if I’m wrong, a biostatistician can be an epidemiologist but an epidemiologist can’t be a biostatistician. 

Basically you can do almost everything with an mph in biostats that you can with an mph in Epi. But you also have the entire world of statistics open to you. You can actually work as just a statistician. But with Epi there are many statistics career fields that you wouldn’t be able to do. "

publichealth,"I think it's more ridiculous how low the salaries were prior to this. If anything, this salary point is a more competitive figure to attract better talent in the future. This guy was making $800k at UMD (a public university). Why should the pinnacles of scientific research and public health in the United States earn less than the average public medical school dean? Even FQHC CEOs (a public, nonprofit entity) make around $200-250k, and most of them have no medical degree or PhD. "
publichealth,"Im glad I found this post because I was going to make one myself! I graduated with my MPH and had a chance to attend some social epidemiology seminars. I’ve been interested in chronic disease epidemiology but in the context of social epi. I’m not sure how to blend those two together but some faculty I come across in social epi departments seem to have specialties in things like environmental epi and clinical/chronic disease epi? I also bought Krieger’s book some time ago, haven’t finished it but looking forward to reading more "
publichealth,"The starting income for biostat is high enough that some loans won't kill you-assuming your school isn't exorbitantly expensive.

I'm in epi but I got ~30k from my school just by asking for money so....definitely ask."
publichealth,"I'm pretty sure you're the contrarian one here. No one is saying to ignore race in clinical practice. We're talking about how **the field of public health** discusses race and risk factors. Public health is political/macro in a way clinical medicine is not. That's what clinicians tend to miss and it's what you're missing here. 

&gt; providers in the trenches see race and know what morbidities are associated with it. 

And again, observing correlation between race and disease outcome is not evidence of causation, even if we're pretending that the correlations you notice as an individual in practice are in any way scientifically valid. I'm really not sure why I have to keep saying this to you, the dentist who took a bunch of science classes. 

I'm not sure why you're bashing public health scientists, the article is written by an OB/GYN. She's black, and has had much more training in this field than you. You, the (white? man?) dentist, are dismissing evidence from people objectively better qualified than you to make a statement on the issue...because you took science classes? And have a lot of POC patients? Hubris indeed.  "
publichealth,"I wouldn’t say that biostatisticians can outright be epidemiologists. It is probably easier but at the end of the day the instincts and thought process is slightly different for each area. Biostatisticians will have a stronger instinct and sense for the numbers and statistical methodology. Epidemiologist will have stronger instincts for biology, medicine, and determinants. Where they really shine is when people from both disciplines work together. Also depending on the school your epi education might involve a lot of biostats so you can be somewhat effectively prepared to do either if needed. "
publichealth,You are not annoying them.  It is their job!
publichealth,"If global health is that competitive wouldn't I be better off doing the biostats degree at UA? I wouldn't be limited to global health, and I would think it would make me pretty marketable as a data scientist in non-global PH?"
publichealth,"I’ve found that a lot of entry level research h coordinator positions are through the local university here. I’m not sure where you’re from but there’s a Facebook page in my area that will post public health positions weekly so maybe you can find something similar. Also heard local SOPHE chapters will post positions as well "
publichealth,"In undergrad I did things like this a *lot* because I wanted to figure out where in public health I fit. If you feel nervous about cold calling/emailing people, you could also use LinkedIn to find people who share connections with you, or are alumni from your school.

publichealth,"Of course it isn't all racism, but I get the vibe that when people say this, they're basically saying ""You're really exaggerating how much racism plays a role,"" when the reality is that poverty, culture, and generational trauma all partially derive from racism. 

No one lists racism as a risk factor anywhere, despite there being enough evidence to indicate that racism is a bigger risk factor than race in maternal health. That's the point.  "
publichealth,"The last time I looked to it there were obviously a lot of problems with collecting good data because it’s so stigmatized.

publichealth,"I had 5 years of nursing experience before I entered the program.

You certainly don't have to take the advice of an internet stranger, but I think the field is saturated enough that you probably would need a master's to actually acquire a proper epidemiology job, since that is probably the level of education of your competing applicants. Furthermore, if your weak point was math such that your in the 14th percentile..then you might really struggle when accepted to a program and you get into your analytics/SAS class and you're trying to figure out Poisson regression (not to sound snobby, because literally the same thing happened to me). If it's what you're really passionate about it may be worthwhile to take the time to improve your quantitative skills in order to improve your scores to not only get accepted to a program, but to prepare for what you'll be against once you're in!"
publichealth,"Those certification sound like a good idea. I'll look into that. 

I don't interact with my leadership at all in my position so I may need to look into how to get more involved with them.

Absolutely I'd love to work and advance but I'm in research which it seems I need to get into an administrative role.   "
publichealth,"Thanks for the info! I have several co-authors, but none of us are at CDC (we're at the state level).

Australian government statistics on cervical cancer:

In 2017, it is estimated that it will remain the 14th most commonly diagnosed cancer among females.

In 2017, it is estimated that the risk of a female being diagnosed with cervical cancer by her 85th birthday will be 1 in 166

publichealth,"I agree with this 100%. I almost failed high school, did four in the infantry, and 10 years after HS I used my GI bill to get into undergrad (biology and anthropology). You might look for a ""veterans upward bound"" program if local Uni's have one, they will have resources and advice. Also your language skills are a plus, make sure that they show up in your letter.

You'll most likely need to do the GRE and programs do look at that score and take it into account.

publichealth,"I am also in the same position. I honestly don't think being CAHME accredited is that big of a deal. A lot of the graduates from MPH-HMP still get the same job offers as the MHA students (although there are a few fellowships and scholarships that require a CAHME accredited program).

From what I've gathered, an MPH degree is more broad, and it's a healthcare degree that focuses on the management aspect. Also, MPH degrees usually require a greater breadth of classes like an intro course to biostatistics, epidemiology, and health behavior. An MHA degree is more focused, and it's more of a business degree that focuses on healthcare. "

I was accepted to 4/5 schools to which I applied, all big names. I just obtained my MPH, and I’m in my first year of doctoral studies. There absolutely is hope. 

Get strong letters, obtain advice crafting your CV ( you are an older student with a lot of real world experience- this is a huge asset, so highlight it), and spend a lot of time on your essays. You’ve got this!"
publichealth,"In most Ph.D. programs, you will be required to retake core introduction courses, including Epidemiology/Biostatistics courses. Even if it's not a requirement, it's a good idea. I spent my year between MPH and Ph.D. working in the health department as an epidemiologist but spent most of my time coding SAS scripts. 

The big draw to a Ph.D. program is being able to design and lead your research, instead of just being able to carry out research. I'm in international health, and for me, the Ph.D. was also a way to open doors in the international arena.

Interviews will rarely test you on basic concepts, they'll ask about your experiences, intentions, and research interests. The most successful applicants are coming into a Ph.D. with a clear research area for their thesis, and may already have funding or research opportunity through their job."
publichealth,"How small are the classes? I went to a different highly-ranked state school from my MPH and most of my classes were just my same cohort of 25 people (MPH my year in my department), with the school-wide PH core courses being more like 100 (but with smaller weekly sub-sections of only 15-25) and a few department-wide core courses having around 40-50."

publichealth,"""How does medical marijuana differ from recreational marijuana?
While medical marijuana has some regulations in terms of formulation and dispensing, all forms of legal marijuana are required to meet specific standards for potency, concentration and purity. While recreational marijuana will also be subject to some regulations, it will contain less of the medicinal cannabidiol and more of the THC, which recreational marijuana users seek out for its euphoric effect. Clearly, these safeguards are not in place for illegally acquired marijuana.""

That's not how its played out in Colorado, I wonder where the author got this information. In Colorado a dispensary will have a room where mother plants are maintained for cloning. Literally the only difference between cannabis destined for the counter on one side of the room labeled ""medical"" versus the other side of the room labeled ""recreational"" is the color of the tax tag attached to the stem. They are typically grown in exactly the same, optimized way, harvested and dried in exactly the same way and sold the same way. We can argue about the variability in cannabinoid and terpene distribution based on the crop produced because that does vary even with very nearly identical growing techniques but at least in Colorado the bud you buy at one counter is the same bud that you buy at the other counter.

Also the assertion of causation by the author regarding cannabidiol as medicinal versus THC apparently being something different isn't based on the evidence. The entourage effect is likely playing a role in any perceived therapeutic benefit and anecdotally people make treatment decisions which result in treatment patterns that suggest THC is beneficial for some complaints while CBD is beneficial in others. Based on pharmacokinetics alone, when I see repeated dosing every three hours I think THC but when I see different patterns I think about a different pharmacokinetic profile. 

The authors points about kids being exposed is perfectly valid and I agree completely, same with driving. "

And all the authors are part of the same center (but different branches and teams) CDC clearance is a notoriously slow process. Expect months of sitting and waiting."

publichealth,"Hi!  Happy to share.  Basically I had the interest in RN from doing a few years as an EMT.  Once I got into Public Health I kept ending up in quasi-clinical roles like communicable disease and rural primary care for county and state.

I noticed that in the rural parts the RN was often the only health educator.  I liked the intersection of 1:1 care (give the shot) and population health (design outreach program for shots).  I've also worked with some RN/MPH that have very cool jobs going into outbreak zones and disaster response.

In my current position I manage several clinics and have a dozen RN or NP employees.  I could see the need for credibility and the benefit of seeing patients if necessary.  I work for a hospital system so the RN is held up there in prestige  Many of our clients are themselves clinical (we do their infection control and occupational health) so it comes in handy when arguing policy or with disease outbreaks.

As I eyed next steps for my career all the cool jobs in hospital systems required an RN.  Lots of upcoming retirements in leadership.  While there are lots of great jobs away from the hospital setting, I'll admit I do like the pay scale here more!  The last motivation was that work would pay 25% plus be flexible with my hours for clinical rotations.  They also dangled a 10% raise once I could see patients.

It was tough, and I only survived thanks to my supportive spouse.   But I feel like it was worthwhile."
publichealth,"Doesn't UNC offer a masters program in veterinary epidemiology? That might be something to check out.

publichealth,"Current biostatistician here (technically a research analyst, but whatever). I briefly considered getting an MD, but don't have a head for memorizing biology, so I ended up here! 

Your day and projects will depend on where you decide to work. Most biostatisticians end up in either industry (think pharmaceuticals), academics (university research), or government (CDC usually, doing either pharma work or the Center for National Health Statistics). I personally work in academics at a large US institution. Industry definitely pays better, but if you want more say in the analytics for projects early on in your career academics is the place to be. Either way, your job will either be grant funded or ""hard money"". Choose one that is ""hard money"" if possible so you don't risk losing it every year if the grant doesn't get renewed.

The market is huge for biostatisticians, as long as you live on the east coast, near Chicago, or on the west coast. If not, and you don't live near a big research institution, prepare to move.  While there are work from home biostatistician jobs, I don't recommend that for your first position. You will also need to widen your search to include research analyst, medical statistics, etc to get the full breadth of offered jobs, as most aren't actually called biostatistician.

My day to day work varies. Being in academia, I act as a consulting statistician to faculty in addition to running the numbers. I am responsible for everything analytically from project conception to publication. I have about 50 projects I am responsible for (average for my group is 20, they are all in different stages). Each day depending on what I am working on, but on average I spend about 2 hours cleaning data, 2-3 hours in meetings (planning a study or going over results), 2 hours writing and running analytic code, and 2 hours writing up results.  I personally love my job, and enjoy the day to day challenges that come with so many projects!

Regarding career progression, there is plenty of room for advancement, at least in academia (although that is somewhat institutionally dependent). Usually you need 15-20 years of experience for the uppermost tier at most universities, with lots of stepping stones in between. "

At the bare minimum:

* Intro to Statistics

Other useful courses to take:

* Computer programming language: python, R, SAS, STAT
* Differential equations

Also: I'm very pro CEPH-accredited MPH program as someone else said. I also think the more you work in public health, the more you will identify exactly what it is you want to do.

publichealth,"I would keep it simple and look at association between stress levels (measured with a standardized test) and some kind of 'healthy eating' behaviour, also measured with a standardized test. Research which ones are most commonly used and appropriate for your question. If you find something that is validated and boils down 'healthy eating' to something easy like a score, you can work with that.

Once you want to study 'effects' or 'changes', you have to do a much more difficult design, though, if you don't actually have to do the study, you could go for it. 

Something like measuring both stress and 'healthy eating' when they come in and then maybe once a year while they're in college. Also make sure to measure any other factors identified in the literature as having an effect. I'm not particularly knowledgable on the subject but work load in addition to stress (it's not the same) would probably have to be part of it."

I wouldn’t be surprised if the department of health would expect you to have experience when applying.

publichealth,"How much do you want to get paid? Social workers make more money in Canada than the US. I hear MSW’s start around $60,000 there whereas $43,000 is the starting of you work for the government that is. In the US it seems there are more jobs for social workers, it’s more high demand than public health. This is ironic because public health should be in higher demand but it’s a systemic issue if you think about it.

I’m not sure about Canada but the US spends very little money on prevention and tons of money on treating symptoms. This of MPH health promotion as primary prevention and think of MSW as working in the chronic dysfunction, triage, when shit hits the fan.

While they may not make the most, it seems like shit is quite literally always hitting the fan. So with the MSW you might not make $100,000 a year relying on just your MSW alone, you will have pretty great job security. I’m not sure what public health is like in Canada but it’s got to be better than here. 

Regardless of what degree you get, how much money you make depends on wat more factors than the degree you have. It’s about your network, your ideas, and the time you have. If you have 3 children and an MSW, you’ll probably have a harder time succeeding than if you have none and tons of free time/ able to move wherever whenever. 

Anyways, I’m doing the dual degree program. So far my first year has been paid for through a fellowship. It’s been a great experience and I’ve learned transferable skills through my MSW internship mainly I’ve been doing grant writing and I’m getting the hang of it. Currently though I’m starting a business next month so I’m pretty excited for that as well!"

Epi can be the in-between of the two, and you might want to look into environmental epidemiology if you are interested in having some field work available to help with."

I've also read that even tho I'm in epi/Biostats I'd be able to take some IDV classes as electives, which sounds sweet.

The Bay having any public transportation at all sounds so amazing to me after living in such a car centric place for so long haha.

I actually considered USC, but my mentor kinda discouraged me from applying to programs rather than schools. It's good to hear they offer such great training though! If you don't mind me asking, what made you choose it over schools of public health like UCLA? Do you feel like the extra money was worth it? I'd imagine you must have had a smaller cohort so perhaps some more attention from faculty and such? And another personal question but do you work at LADPH or some other health department? What's the work day like? Do you enjoy it and feel full filled by it? How hard was it to get that first position? I know with government work it can be kinda difficult to get that first position.

publichealth,"I can't stand SAS but it's a sad fact that 90% of clinical research companies use it. I would love to just use R or even Stata instead, but it's not happening anytime soon."
publichealth,Pardon my ignorance.  How does an MPH help you with program management in research?  I am assuming that is what you want to do.  I am currently doing my MPH online.  Let me know if I can help.
publichealth,"If you are disabled, I believe you are under Medicare, so there would be some women and children.  Also if you have ALS or ESRD, you can use medicare."
publichealth,"If you want to move forward in life, take the full time position. There’s no question. Otherwise you’re just trying to piece together two part time jobs into some semblance of a career, and that’s no way to live. Also I would put money on the near-immediate radio silence of the prn job you have if your availability goes to four days a month. They’ll find another quickly. Finally you’re losing money on travel unless you’re riding a bike or moped. Mileage reimbursement never really covers wear and tear or taxes/fees. Take the full time job."
publichealth,"Absolutely! I had dual concentrations in community and behavioral health as well as Health Systems Management and policy. I took the required bio stats class which was fine in stata and then took an extra course in SAS but I’m still having a hard time finding a job without experience in SQL, SPSS, or similarly, tableaux. 

As I’m sure you’ve figured out by now public health is about two things
1. Money
2. The data

If II can be passionate about public health AND a data head you’ll be indispensable. "
publichealth,"US News rankings don't matter as their methodology (# of publications/year) tends to favor larger programs. As a result, smaller but strong programs including NYU, Dartmouth, UPenn, Brown, USC, UVA, Tufts, and Vanderbilt are left off the list.

What's more important is your fit with the program. I can't speak for BU, since I did not apply there. I'm a current first-year student at Yale (though I am not SBS), and I have loved my experience so far. Top-notch career services, amazing faculty, and the school is very well-connected with NYC, DC, Boston, and California. 

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about Yale, via PM or otherwise. Congratulations on your acceptance!"
publichealth,"I did a volunteer position as a Victim Advocate for the local sexual assault center in my county. It's definitely not easy, but you learn a *lot*. The socialization aspect was probably the hardest part for me because I am not always the best at coming up with something to say, but most of the position is listening first anyways."
publichealth,"I'm curious about your role...are you coordinating and planning these outreach activities? Evaluating their effectiveness? Or implementing them and working directly with the target population?

I have a BA, have been a health educator for a while, and would like to get an MPH to hopefully work more on the systems-level side of things."
publichealth,"I am a Program Manager in our county's health insurance plan. I started as a Project Specialist in the call center planning  call campaigns, writing operational  policies, and doing data analysis. Moved to the PMO as a Project Analyst where I put together business requirements and workflows for new cross functional processes and systems. Then became a project manager in PMO implementing these projects. Now as a Program Manager, I oversee the execution of several projects under a company wide initiative to reengineer our health services delivery model. "
publichealth,"I’m a Clinical Pharmacy Specialist (PharmD) in Infectious Diseases.  I primarily do antimicrobial stewardship. It’s more patient care work but there are opportunities for research and PI. "
publichealth,"I'm currently completing an MPH program part-time, working full-time (unrelated to PH), in Boston. From what I *hear* the job market here is pretty decent. There are biomed companies all over the place, tons of hospitals, and plenty of universities. I'm in the epi/bio concentration and have had plenty of opportunities, through my school, to attend ""a day in the life"" presentations from alums who work either directly in epi or indirectly (on research related projects). These individuals usually work either with the city, state, or in hospitals. Some do data-related work in the private sector.

All in all, the job outlook seems pretty good here. I keep an eye on the market for myself, just to see what's out there, where I want to end up, the kind of work I'd particularly like to focus on, and I really don't see a shortage of jobs. I also know that a decent amount of graduates from my program have found jobs relatively quickly. That being said, I don't know their previous experience so there are factors that may have played into them finding work quickly that I don't know about. But as I said, I'm still working full-time so I haven't actually been in the PH job market yet. Suffice it to say there seem to be plenty of opportunities in the city in a number of different sectors.

Also, I'm not sure what your situation is finance-wise outside of tuition, but Boston can be expensive to live in. I'm not as familiar with Philly but Boston's rent prices have been rising steadily. The good thing is that public transportation is relatively reliable and is plentiful so there are options for you to live in areas that aren't as expensive. Also, Boston is a great city and close to a lot of great stuff in the surrounding area.

Good luck and reach out if you have other questions, I'd be happy to try to answer them."
publichealth,Do you mind sharing a bit of your educational background and experience? I'd love to do similar work but find myself stump on how to get there. I'm in my final year of undergrad for PH
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,"Thanks! Yes, I think that's what I'll do. Just try to get hired as is without getting into more debt...
When you talk about taking classes, do you think where I take the classes would matter? What I mean by that is, would classes from online sources such as Coursera, or Edx.org be taken seriously?"
publichealth,"I have looked at Planned Parenthood and there's a great position for them in my city available, but due to my plans for saving for law school I'll be living at home. My Catholic parents would be less than happy with me working at PP, and at this point I can't afford to move out yet (see: me desperately trying to find a job).

But as for your comment about being sticklers for having masters degree, do many public health employers stick hard and fast to other ""requirements""? If it says ""1-3 years experience required"", are they strict on that?"
publichealth,"Okay, yes i definitely have the willpower to be an MD and here in Switzerland it only costs me 800 bucks each semester because the state pays for the education so funds are no problem. But then I'll just do epidemiology personally or check out our public health institute as they always search for people. And just taking a look has never hurt anyone I guess. "

publichealth,"I'm currently getting my MPH and everyone in school has their ""focus"" or issue that they want to work on when they graduate but I have not met one person who has said the opioid epidemic. Every time a friend asks my opinion the problem just seems so daunting and just this massive looming behemoth of an issue. Does anyone know anyone focusing on this issue? I would love to hear about their work. "
publichealth,Can I ask where you received your MPH?
publichealth,"Received both BS and M in Public Health from the University of the Philippines (which is what I assume you are too, Isko/a!). Although taking up more bio/eco courses in undergrad would help (I loaded my general education courses with Bio and NatSci subjects), I would echo the previous post saying that you're all set for taking up EH/IH in graduate school. The only time I heard calculus was a requisite is for students who will take MSPH Biostatistics or MSPH Epidemiology. They are allowed to take these pre-requisites. I should also say that faculty advisers are there to assess whether or not to take any more pre-requisites and how to map out your study plan to make the most out of your time in grad school :) Padayon!"
publichealth,"Thank you for the informative response! So I'm guessing based on what you're saying most fresh graduates first work as fellows or contractors before getting a full position? How many years of experience is a full time entry level epi in the feds required to have? I'd assume jumping straight into a full time position isn't as common as it is in other industries. 

Would you say that the CDC would generally expect more experience than a local or state health department would require? Or would the positions simply be more competitive because of the strength of the national applicant pool vs the smaller ones for local departments."
publichealth,"As someone who does use both, I say you also think about python. Statisticians are the CS programmers of the research world and the more languages you understand and the tools you acquire, the better off you'll be in the long run. Of course, in a world dominated by older individuals who just don't want to learn new languages, this is a wildly unpopular opinion."
publichealth,"I applied for the Fulbright US Research grant, and am currently spending a year in Kenya. When I return in August, I'll go directly into grad school (that applied to while in Kenya) with experience in global health, research, and working with non-profits. Highly recommended"
publichealth,"If this is just a class assignment and not a real research study you could look at say an obesity rates database and narrow down to the typical age range for undergraduates and change your initial plan to talk about this age range and then talk about the undergrad stress as a factor. The issue with that is they might not all be going to college. "
publichealth,"The specific master's typically doesn't matter from my experience when working as an IH.  I have a generalist MPH degree, the guy who I learned IH under only had a bachelor's (in healthcare finance!) and I know a lot of CIH's who don't have specifically IH degrees.  What the degree says doesn't matter if you have the coursework to understand what is going on (biology, chemistry, physics, calc, statistics).  Considering you undergrad is in bio, I'm going to assume you took organic, so you've already got the hardest course under your belt.  And because you're an engineer, I know you can do math, the second hardest part academically.

If you want to learn the equipment, that's great, but you can do that through manuals and youtube videos.  I started off as an IH technician and learned a set of equipment in school, only to find we didn't have that exact stuff at later jobs. Seriously, 30 minutes with the manual or a video, and you're up to speed on 75% of this stuff.

Using these meters often takes some know how, but that know-how is as much about selecting the appropriate meter for the situation as it is about how to hold up a velocicalc.  Depending on where you work, the IH's may not even use the equipment themselves.  IH technicians may do all the sampling once you come up with the sampling plan.

Also, regarding the CIH CEU's, they'll come as part of your job, don't sweat it.  I've never taken an over the table IH class in school, but have a ton of CEU's because I need to keep learning to stay current at my job.  If you're working in a good place, they'll have lots of opportunities to learn.  Plus, you need several years of on the job experience before you can even apply to take the test, so worry about that after you've got some time in the field!

You're probably more competitive than you realize!"
publichealth,"This isn't help for this specific question, but as a general rule if a true/false question has the word ""always"" then it's false. Almost every situation has an exception. "
publichealth,"Set aside a regular time interval for coursework that you make every effort to keep.  Even if you don't have an assignment to work on, use the time to read, re-read, or focus on your interests.  Treat it like an independent study and commit to learning outside of the class parameters."
publichealth,"One thing to consider is what you want to do after graduation. Most schools have a larger network in their immediate area, so if you want to go into pharmaceuticals Rutgers would set you up well. I don't know if any of these programs are better than the others, but their industry connections in the region are something to think about when making a decision."
publichealth,"Very true. "
publichealth,"Thank you for your reply! Regarding each caveat, I actually applied to schools intending on working in the Netherlands, although my interests have shifted and I have become more open to staying in the US. In terms of one year vs two year, I think it’s more a matter of pace - the Northwestern program is technically one calendar year but each term is a quarter and I would be able to take more courses than in the MPH program (really one 3 semesters with focus on practicums). Thank your for your insight into the last bullet point (publishable research vs work experience). If you don’t mind me asking, what sort of program did you attend and what is your career goal/current line of work?"
publichealth,We use SAS at the research institution where I work.
publichealth,"Neither do I, but they do have international presenters and it is an excellent venue to network."
publichealth,"Thanks, I'll definitely look into those options! :)"
publichealth,"That's a pretty darn good salary! Are you still in the CA area? 

Yeah cost of living is definitely something that is making me raise an eyebrow. I might try to live on campus the first year at least. I'm totally down to have a roomie...would that bring costs down?

I'm glad to see there's a good work/life balance. That's very important to me. As long as I find a job after graduating and get a return on my investment, that's all I can ask for!"
publichealth,"I'd recommend UCLA.  Something to note about Tulane is that the GEHS program is small, and IH specifically is the smallest part of it.  As a result, your sources for both academic support and networking for jobs will be extremely limited."
publichealth,"What's your work like as a disease intervention specialist? Are you mostly doing data analysis? My degree was in health promotion so I am trying to break in as a health educator, so I'm really interested in how you made the jump to disease intervention. "
publichealth,"Just re-read your post and realized it's a research proposal, whoops! So you're just trying to find background info? Definitely check out BRFSS. It asks (some years, not all) for an estimate of # of fruit and vegetable servings consumed per day. That's used pretty often as a measure of nutrition. They also ask questions about physical activity if you want to go that route. Maybe check out NHANES too. I don't know off the top of my head if they ask nutrition questions, but that survey is pretty comprehensive so it's worth a try."
publichealth,"This is what I want ����, thanks for putting a name on the description lol"
publichealth,"That's kinda weird, a graduate degree isn't usually entry level.  I don't know much beyond EH, so I can't speak specifically to other fields within PH but you technically don't even need a degree for a lot of the tech jobs.  I started as an Industrial Hygiene technician which only required passing a background check, as this was for the government. "

publichealth,"Thanks for your thoughts. I believe MPVM is masters of preventative veterinary medicine? If so, no, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking a masters of veterinary public health - such as this one http://online.missouri.edu/degreeprograms/health-professions/veterinary-public-health/masters/index.aspx -- that one is online, but there are also a few schools that have on-campus programs that are similar.

It's basically an MPH degree, but the specialization/elective classes are related to veterinary-specific topics.

The PhD route is interesting, though. I do hold a masters in another field, so might be able to leverage that to go straight into a PhD. I will have to explore those options, I hadn't really considered it before. Thanks!"

publichealth,"Thanks for taking the time to get back to me!  I have seen that environmental engineering is one of the preferred degrees on job postings, but was just concerned about my lack of experience in field sampling with IH-specific equipment (through my background I have experience with sampling of environmental contaminants in the field though).  After doing some research and getting feedback on this sub, I agree that the best option would be to take some CEU's through the AIHA and continue to learn the equipment through manuals/videos.  Thanks again, cheers!     "
publichealth,"hey there, Canadian hygienist here. Given your internship in H&amp;S and your educational background, i think you're at most a year or so behind someone with an ABET accredited degree. I would opt to not go back to school. Instead, start looking for junior positions with an EHS focus, and do some of the continuing ed options to fill in your gaps through the [American Industrial Hygiene Assocation](https://www.aiha.org/education/Pages/default.aspx), with the long term goal of writing your CIH. Continuing Ed courses will be bit cheaper overall than dropping a work search to go back to school, and the right employer might even pay for some of your courses."
publichealth,"I didn't actually look for a campus job because I came from a non-traditional background and wanted to focus on studying. I think most of the on campus jobs depend on having a relationship with faculty (as is the case at every school) so def take advantage of office hours and talks around campus. 

I do feel like my MPH was worth it. It took me about a year to find a job after I graduated (mostly because of personal factors and not UCLA) but now I'm in the exact field I want to be in. "
publichealth,"That assumes you get paid 52 weeks a year, which either means you have paid time off, or it means you have no vacation."
publichealth,"Just try a few. Some have restrictions, some require you to be a certain age, some have education/licensure requirements. Just ask. I know that's not specific information, but you can always try a subreddit in your area for more specific volunteer locations. "
publichealth,"Quick question - are you required to take this exam? If not, I would highly consider not blowing the money."
publichealth,"&gt;What did you do right after you received your bachelors?

My newly-graduated ass got stranded in an industry-wide hiring freeze. The first tech bubble had burst, and I was scrambling to find any job I could. I wound up waiting tables and volunteering with a health-related community-based organization.

Then I applied and went to grad school the following year. Earned my MPH the year after that. Got a job as an epi shortly thereafter.

Now here I am...*on Reddit.*"
publichealth,"Thank you so much for your thoughts! I really appreciate the insight of someone who is in the field (and has an MPH and PhD themselves!).

To answer your questions:
Why I want to go straight into a PhD:I want to be a research professor. I need a PhD for that, and I want it. I have a strong understanding of my ""niche"" in public health. I already have my bachelor's in public health, and work experience in the field, so I don't necessarily feel the need to repeat the basics of public health, either. I feel ready.

On MS vs MPH: And MPH is a ""practice"" degree, but an MS is a ""research degree."" I have been told (by employers, admissions directors, faculty) that people who want to research, and who want to get a PhD should pursue an MS rather than an MPH for this reason. Did you have a different experience? Did you go straight into your PhD or wait a few years after the MPH?

You are right, Harvard has my heart. It is the right fit, the right curriculum, the right research team...But the wrong degree (not a PhD) and the most expensive option on the table. I have been mulling this over for nearly a month, and I don't feel any closer to a sense of certainty.

Again, thank you so much for your response!"

publichealth,"It would be cheaper for you to do this. Post MPH jobs don't make much. So just go for it.. 

The MPH degree doesn't matter, as long as you have it and it's CEPH accredited... your work experience matters the most"
publichealth,"MPH in Health Behavior work in a variety of settings. It really just depends on what you focus on and do. I know people I graduated with (~3 years ago) who work in everything from $20,000 a year field coordinator positions to $250,000 a year Director positions. It just depends on the focus.

Majoring in Health Behavior does not mean you have to give up the Epi portion. Several people who focus on Health Behavior develop strong backgrounds in statistical analysis. I think it actually assists individuals who are interested in programmatic developments based on theory.

The one thing I would say is that you may want to ask why they suggested it. In some cases, if they feel your background in stats/biology is not strong enough, but you are still a good candidate, they will offer admission through some other means.

publichealth,"I'm only 23, so I'm still figuring out ""how to get there,"" but I have a BS in Health Promotion. It took me a while to care in undergrad, so my GPA isn't the greatest nor did I have any research experience aside from a 5mon internship with health education. I knew I eventually wanted to do research/epi, so I mostly looked for RA/Program Assistant positions. I started on two studies (Nov 2016), and recently became a coordinator with the addition of a third study! 

It can get discouraging applying, but it just takes one opportunity! One of my biggest regrets is not gaining research experience in undergrad, but what can you do lol"
publichealth,"This. Furthermore, it concerns me you wouldn't be able to get in touch with the supervisor by the deadline to accept; I am sure there's a good reason, but that's a major red flag to me."
publichealth,I just realized that I loved math and public health this week and I’d be an awful doctor or nurse but good stats person.
publichealth,"Maybe even farther away from health. Think about community events, like big street festivals and such. Could you be the one that helps coordinate bringing in health screenings? Or if you're under a community council, could you help them identify health coverage gaps in your community? Could you get them to do a walkablity study? Can you work with local churches to host a health fair? What about working with local boy\girl scout troops to assist in any health-related badges? Are their local senior groups\ Rotary Clubs\ Kwianis etc that need health education presentations?

I feel like the work we do is so powerful and so impactful on the lives of those around us, we should apply our knowledge where ever useful. "
publichealth,"I applied to be an HRTP intern for Fall 2015. I interviewed in mid-September 2015, was accepted for a position within the Bureau of Preparedness and Response, and started in mid-November 2015. I was there until June 2016. 

I believe that the figure is one in four students who submit applications are accepted for the next stage. In this second stage, students are part of a pool that DOHMH staff can review. If a staff member is interested in an applicant, they contact the student directly. Depending on the staff needs, it's possible that applicants in this pool are contacted for multiple interviews; conversely, an applicant may not be contacted for an interview. Unlike Epi Scholars, HRTP interns aren't made aware of available projects ahead of time; rather, they learn of projects when staff contact them and describe the available opportunity. 

HR processing of students who have accepted a position varies wildly. Some students are able to start in a timely manner while others start near the end of the season. I think that it took approximately six weeks for my position to be cleared by HR. I didn't have an issue with this, but I know that other students struggled to complete an entire internship in a shortened time period. Unfortunately, there's nothing that can be done about this. 

Ultimately, my position ended up being a largely administrative role. This wasn't how the position was originally explained to me, and was disappointing; however, I gained a lot of valuable experience in being able to see first-hand how a large city agency functions at different levels. In addition, being an HRTP intern can be very helpful in obtaining a full-time position at DOHMH."
publichealth,"&gt; Columbia! Important detail I neglected to mention

"
publichealth,"Thanks! That’s interesting, I’m almost finished getting my MPH at such a school. Last question, is there an age limit like is typical for other kinds of service? "
publichealth,"I agree that they vary. Here is one set of descriptions from an academic medical center: [Link](http://hr.uw.edu/comp/professional-staff/2015-professional-staff-salary-survey/research/) These are only the descriptions for professional (exempt/salaried) positions. There are also hourly positions that are union positions -- e.g., at this institution, Research Coordinator is salaried but Research Study Coordinator is not. Keep in mind that the qualifications listed are the minimum qualifications to be included in that job class; most departments will have their own qualifications which are higher than the minimum ones. It is not uncommon for any of these positions to require a Master's degree or equivalent work experience. 


If I were you, I would look into jobs such as Research Assistant (at some institutions), Program Assistant in an area you are interested in, or maybe something in the laboratory if you like that kind of work. After my Bachelor's in Public Health, I worked as a Program Assistant/Coordinator and volunteered myself for research duties as much as possible within that role until I had enough experience to get a fully research position. I had to show them that I could steward a research study well and that I understood GCP, IRB regulations, FDA requirements (for clinical trials), etc. In the meantime, I got some administrative skills and learned what kinds of duties I liked, was good at, didn't ever want to do, etc. 


Edit: I did also have a research job during my undergraduate studies and part of the time after I graduated, so that probably helped a lot. "
publichealth,"For those of you without JAMA subscription, they link to the [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01583985) web page for the trial that shows a lot of info for free.

publichealth,"I would definitely agree with this, at my program it's allowed as long as you're doing something different from your normal work. Shouldn't be a problem as long as it's public health-related."
publichealth,"If you want to work for a US governmental organization, then you're going to need the CEPH accreditation. The only people I know who successfully studied outside of the US and still ""worked"" with US organizations, had foreign grant money. So from my understanding, the CDC etc. are strict about CEPH accreditation. 


However, if you want to work in the private sector or outside of the US, a foreign degree shouldn't be an issue. My former boss got his MPH in the Netherlands and initially worked at an American branch of a multinational pharmaceutical company."

1. This is an appropriate definition if you are looking at one defined area. If you are trying to explain that this is occurring beyond one continent, then you would use pandemic. If you are specifically for the USA, then epidemic is appropriate.

I learned more from working in the field (public health) than I learned in school; I would definitely recommend working for awhile.

publichealth,"Biostats and epi will give you the skills that you can apply in pretty much any area of public health, and biostats can even be applied outside of public health if you someday decide to shift your career to a different field.

I do find it fun, fulfilling, and at times, stressful. It can be hard to hear patients' stories and know that you're piling on even more stress and challenges in their lives. On the other hand, it is very rewarding connecting people to services and seeing them make changes and thriving afterward, and knowing that you played a vital role."
publichealth,"I graduated with a BS in Public Health (social and behavioral sciences concentration) in May, and got a job as a case manager for people with disabilities a few weeks later. I ended up hating it, and am now a clinical research coordinator for ophthalmologists. I’m enjoying this position a lot more, and I think that I want to go to grad school for my MPH in epidemiology. I like research more than I thought I would."
publichealth,"That's a great point. I was recommended for the position by a mutual contact, but it didn't make me feel good to have it be assumed I'd just want to work him. 

I've accepted my offer with the great supervisor. I also have the opportunity to do a second internship in another semester, so I can contact that other interesting organization and maybe get a better/more organized supervisor. Thanks again for your help!"
publichealth,"I do more data analysis than most disease investigators on my office because I'm on a team of epis, but the general function is following up on reportable disease cases. This usually entails calling the patient to get some exposure history or reading through their medical records. We conduct surveys in outbreak investigations getting complete food histories for enteric outbreaks, or working with schools\childcare centers to establish control measures and exclusion criteria for things like pertussis. I also do data entry during flu season, and year-end data QA\QC for specific morbidities."
publichealth,Supervisor you like all the way IMO
publichealth,Thanks for the info!
publichealth,"Thanks - this is still quite useful to know as it provides me a step into the public health world. I'll definitely try and find someone with a health communications role and ask what the requirements are. 

As for dissertation topic, I have one in mind based around veganism (won't give exact details here and I am a vegan), but I'm at a stage where I am able to change it and did almost consider something around digital and health."
publichealth,"HIV Prevention &amp; Education Manager for a private not for profit company. "
publichealth,"Population health, mainly service assessment and health policy"
publichealth,What is the career track you want?  It is difficult to say whether an MPH is good or bad without knowing what you want to do.
publichealth,"You don't need a doctoral degree to work for the CDC. You can get a FTE aith a Master's degree, but it's not easy, especially under the current administration. Doctoral degrees allow you to get the higher level jobs, with less experience. If you have equivalent experience, you can get an Epidemiologist position with an MPH.

If you recently graduated, you can start off at CDC as an ORISE fellow. After a few years, you might get an FTE.

You can also contract at the CDC with a Master's.

Getting into the CDC isn't an issue of degree, necessarily, but having the right connections.

SOURCE: Worked at CDC as a student. Know MANY fellow Master's degree graduates working at the CDC."
publichealth,Oo would you be able to elaborate on what type of systemic barriers that exist? I am very interested in learning more. I definitely agree that justice should be added. Thank you so much for reading my post!
publichealth,"I would think if you found a job somewhere dealing with public health (nonprofits, government agencies, etc), it might give you good experience to land a job after graduation. You might be able to use that volunteer experience at the physical therapists to get a jov somewhere along those lines.Or you could do something like AmeriCorps. 

But to be honest a bachelors is not what it used to be. It took years after graduating for me to find a decent job pertaining to my degree, and even then, I had already decided to go for a masters because having just a bachelors wasn't providing me with as many opportunities as I expected. I say this to warn you that during your MPH, you may not land that ideal job. But don't let that stop you from pursuing the job you want!!

PS - I am actually an MPH student at the UA so feel free to message me. I'm not in the online program, though. "
publichealth,Coursera and EdX used to have public health courses to help get your feet wet in various topics. Can't remember if basic epi methods was offered. I think Hopkins also has some basic epi and other courses available for free online.
publichealth,"I'm super biased and going to tell you to go for nutrition, because I think it covers all the other topics you're interested in!

And if I had that opportunity, I think I would take it. I started my MPH right after undergrad (well, 6 months after I graduated), and I don't regret it. The only thing I would say is that it's good to have a little experience in the public health field first, but it's not absolutely necessary. If you were unsure if you wanted to go into public health, I would say try working in the field first. Otherwise, I say go for it! An MPH will absolutely push you forward, and it's honestly necessary if you want to move up in this field.

Let me know if you have any questions about nutrition!"
publichealth,"I'm currently doing an MPH - Epidemiology and Biostats in the U.K., but hoping to stay in Europe after my programme ends in 2019. I have worked in the field before for Doctors Without Borders as a logistician/supply management. You could look into NGOs or INGOs who have projects in humanitarian or developing context. "
publichealth,"I think the website says 4-6 weeks from the application deadline, but I don’t think a polite email asking about the expected timeline for interviews would be an issue. The bureaucracy at DOHMH can be insanely slow, and I freaked out a bit at Janice during the HR processing period after being accepted to my internship, and she was a total sweetheart about it. 

I know how much it totally sucks to be in limbo like that, but I can assure you that lots is going on behind the scenes. In the meantime, it wouldn’t hurt to reach out to other local health departments or nonprofits that don’t have formal internship programs and ask if they have a project they could use an intern on, if you haven’t already. "
publichealth,"Thanks for the thorough answer, it helps a lot. I really wish I majored in bio! "
publichealth,"""About 50 million of the program’s 75 million enrollees are children, elderly, disabled, or pregnant.""

If I had a dollar for every ""disabled"" Medicaid recipient I watched hop out of a $30k truck and walk into the ER, I'd be able to fund Medicaid. "
publichealth,"I have a good friend who goes to UW for their MPH/RD degree, and it sounds awesome. From what I've heard, the majority of the RD cohort holds graduate assistantship positions which would help out with the cost difference. They also work with students to figure out exactly what type of career in nutrition they are looking for and work with them to place them where they want to be. It seems great - I'd recommend going for the RD. Congrats!"
publichealth,"Ideally, I want to collect data myself and conduct research. I don't think an office job would suffice for my interests. I studied biology and earth and environmental sciences as an undergraduate. Finding something that would link the two + the MPH is an ongoing question for me. "
publichealth,"I just graduated in May 2017 and am currently serving in the Peace Corps and really enjoying it! 

I serve as a county-level school health coordinator where I help support the implementation, evaluation, and monitoring of a national health education strategy. 

I highly recommend Peace Corps if you want to get into international development/global health work in general. It's a really great stepping stone and offers you the opportunity to immerse yourself in and learn a new culture, language, and lifestyle.

Before I left for Peace Corps in September, I worked FT in a management position in retail."
publichealth,"I’m a DIS too! I also do a SMALL amount of epi work! In my position, we not only educate patients about their infection, but we also treat them and complete patient interviews. During these interviews, we collect risk factors and encourage our patients to notify their partners to get tested (or we contact them ourselves). The epi’s do most of the data analysis though. We just collect the data and intervene the chain of infection."
publichealth,"I work in academia doing data management and analysis for epi research papers. I do longitudinal analysis of cohort data looking into predictors of lung disease. "
publichealth,"There are a few programs where you might be able to swing this. Missouri-Columbia has a program, as does UF. Neither require a DVM to my knowledge.

The bigger thing I would be concerned about, in this particular political climate, is that there's a hiring freeze for a lot of relevant positions at the CDC and other federal government jobs if that's what you would want to look at.

Personally, I think it may be better to get the general skills and pivot into a comparable position, if that's something you might be open to."
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,"Absolutely! It's been a while but I'll tell you what I remember.
1. How will you reach your target population?
2. How will you build relationships with community partners?
3. How and why will you utilize faith-based partnerships in community outreach? (In the Southeast churches are heavy outreach partners)
Let me know if you have any other questions! I hope those help and good luck!"
publichealth,None really from what I can see. My alma mater just uses it now in place of oral comprehensive exams in order for students to graduate.
publichealth,"Well at the moment I'm covering for someone who left so I've been doing the work of two people but generally I'm really happy with it. If you've been doing public health related work you should have an easier time getting a gig when you graduate "
publichealth,"You might be able to move into health communications or health promotion with that background. If thats of interest maybe connect with a foundation with a nutrition angle - my first thought is whatever the UK heart disease or diabetes foundation is called, but im sure there are others, and ask about volunteering or an internship doing social media and communications? If you are lucky and persistant you might even be able to use this experience to get credit for one of your courses... some Masters have an open studies course where you could write a situational analysis or similar for credit. A lot of public health people don't fully understand the art of health communication on social media, but most now appreciate its importance, so becoming knowledgeable about this area - theory and application (and how to explain it to others in a respectful and collegiate way - very important!) is a great skill. Just a thought. "
publichealth,"Where did you look, like Indeed.com?"
publichealth,"I was years ago, although I check in on them occasionally and sadly they seem to still be struggling the same issues they had in the past re: lack of faculty and departmental structure.  Be prepared to take a fair number of independent studies if you end up in IH at Tulane."
publichealth,"Hey, How did your interview go?"
publichealth,"Seconded. If you aren't required to take the exam, and you have other qualifications to do public health work (i.e. experience or any level of degree), you should absolutely not waste your money (or validate it by taking it). Its existence is shameful."
publichealth,"That's what I thought, that there was a specific committee just for COI. Glad you clarified. "
publichealth,"I applied to OHSU-PSU last year, and after sitting in on a class I asked some students about the program. They literally warned me to go anywhere else. I guess it's really disorganized and chaotic because the program is so new, so while this could have improved in the last year I'd definitely ask current students if you can!"
publichealth,"If you don't use a reference manager (Zotero, Mendeley, et al) now, try a couple (or more), find one you're sure you like, and use it for *everything*."
publichealth,"Yes and yes.  

Online is manageable with full time work.  Be prepared to take it slow (i.e 4-5 years). 

You will miss out on all networking/career building activities if you do an online program.  I didn't need those, so my perspectives may not be relevant to you. 

If your goal is do hands-on public health research, you may want to consider a PhD.  A full time MPH may help you get into a public health job that involve health research, but you may need to move to a location that has such jobs (e.g Washington DC, Atlanta etc).

Online is good for older people with a well-developed career.  If you are young and can take bigger risks, full time MPH may be a better option."
publichealth,"I am one of the primary authors of this paper. Was pleasantly surprised to come across this post while browsing reddit! Happy to answer any questions anyone might have about our study and this paper! "
publichealth,In both programming and life I agree that knowing more languages in better. I'd even add SQL to the list because we proc SQL a lot in our SAS codes...
publichealth,"I see a lot of comments on here about how saturated the public health marketplace is . I would like to say that depends on where you get a job . If you are looking in D.C , CA, NY and can't find a job that's probably because the marketplace is saturated . However , I recently graduated with my B.S in Public Health and it was relatively easy for me to find a job . I would suggest being open to moving . It really depends on where you are searching for a job in public health . Ohio has lots of public health jobs at the local and state level . Just my two cents . "
publichealth,"For myself, I got a job working in a pathology laboratory in a hospital. Many others in my department with a science bachelors degree went this route, but they honestly would take any bachelors degree, even finance as in one case. They give the option to do a histology technologist program that is less than a year to move up in the department but most others use it as a stepping stone to continue on in a professional program, such as pa school, med school, etc.  I assist with grossing, autopsies,  operating room procedures,  and radiology procedures. Plus if you’re considering a masters in public health, the hospital will help with tuition. "
publichealth,"Public health officials unite! "
publichealth,"QGIS is free and open source. The learning curve is steep and it takes a long time to get comfortable. But it's worth it if you enjoy it. The Esri GIS software you may have seen before is the industry standard but pricey. Check out r/GIS and r/QGIS for more info. "
publichealth,"MA state health dept headquarters is in Boston so you will get better internships if you’re looking at a government job. PA is in Harrisburg. I found a lot more public health jobs in Boston than in Philly, at least in government. "
publichealth,"I was in epidemiology (graduated with my MPH in 2014), but UCLA's industrial hygiene program seems to be really great, and there's tons of work in that area out here in Southern California. Most of the people I know who were in EHS got TA-ships. "
publichealth,"Do you feel like an MPH from UCLA is worth it? I know it has a ton of prestige but I don't know if I should solely rely on that ya know? 

I plan to TA or get a GSR to get those medical benefits and some pocket money, but we'll see. Do you feel like the program benefited you in your current job? Is it difficult to get an on campus job? I'm hearing from current students that it's a breeze!"
publichealth,"For the most part, yes...that is a good introduction the field. But again, a PhD in what? If you're looking at a PhD in Epidemiology, Biostatistics, or Environmental Health, you'll *likely* need to get a Master's degree first. While you may be able to go straight to a PhD from Bachelor's, many top programs look for graduate coursework before the PhD. To this end, they pretty much require a Master's before entry into a PhD. Even if you don't need the Master's, they might look for professional experience in the field prior to matriculation.

If that is your end goal, I'd recommend reading up on the PhD admissions sites for doctoral programs in Epi, Bios, EH, or a similar field. It's not a bad idea to engage with faculty and staff at your program to discuss how to tailor coursework or research experiences towards your career goals.

On the flip side, I don't believe PhD programs in microbiology, etc. *require* a Master's degree. However, you'll likely need more than the basic coursework in biology, chemistry, etc. "
publichealth,How was Intro to Biostat? Was it super hard especially for the mathematically challenged like me?
publichealth,"Hey, hopefully my experience helps you in any way. I am am from Mexico. I studied medicine here in my hometown.It wasa seven year program, equivalent to a MD degree from the U.S. My first two years were fully theoretical, the third through fifth year were mixed about fifty-fifty clinical and theoretical, and the sixth and seventh years were almost fully clinical. I graduated a year ago and have been working fully in public health research since, at my country's National Public Health Institute without pursuing any extra clinical practice. What I can tell you from my experience is that my clinical experience during my medical school years have allowed me to understand certain public health problems more widely, but additional experience as a general physician would have not helped me any further.

Pursuing a residency could have helped me if I wanted to pursue a particular research line, lets say Infectology if I was interested in clinical trials for infectous diseases. I have decided not to pursue a residency, since I want to focus in research that influences public policy. In this example I would have wasted an additional 8 years studying Infectology, which would not have helped me for public policy making. So I decided to dedicate my time fully to public health research (I also do some implementation and evaluation of certain programs, but those are not my central duties or interests). 

There is a middle ground, I have some friends here from work who did a residency and it has certain advantages. For example, a friend of mine studied pediatrics and her public health work is highly related to child development, in that subject she has more expertise, but nothing that you couldn't catch up in a week or two when talking about public policy and new evidence, and I just relate it back to when I took pediatrics in school. And sometimes she ends up doing work on other subjects, tobacco, for example. She also does clinical work on the side, but less as time goes on, because she does not have enough time. If that is an interest of yours, you could also pursue this path.

Myself (if I get the scholarship), I will be starting a MSc of Public Health in London this September, so not quite the expert yet. Anyway, those are my two cents, maybe your situation is radically different, I just hope my situation helps. You can message me if you want more info. Good luck!"
publichealth,Every job or volunteer experience can be written up as experience. Don’t forget that. Worked retail? You have experience in client service and high pressure environments
publichealth,"For the navy, either a BS in an EHA certified under grad program of environmental science or an MPH in environmental health, occupational safety, industrial hygiene, or toxicology at a CEPH certified school of public health. For the Public Health Service, they require an MPH in environmental health "
publichealth,"I'm the type of person that likes to be active and involved. I like working in the community, and hoping that one day I can travel and work.

I volunteered in a lab, but found it too isolating and some of the tasks are repetitive. 

I know I don't want to be stuck in an office, but I can deal with it. I would prefer not to work in a doctor's office. 

I'm hoping to start at the local health department, non profits, or health agencies.

It just seems that in my area of interest, a clinical background is needed."
publichealth,"Hey thanks for your explanation. "
publichealth,"If I had the opportunity to take the accelerated degree for anything I would jump on it like the last life boat off a sinking titanic. As someone who is looking at applying for grad school and having to study for and take the gre after being out of school for 2 years I am terrified. I still have debt, I haven't studied anything in 2 years, my test taking abilities are way down, grad school is expensive and I'm second guessing every degree option.

I am confident in saying that if I had a masters at this point I would have a good stable job instead of being employed for 1 of 2 years, frantically applying to jobs in my field and constantly getting offers at around what I made in high school. A bachelor's is no longer something people (at least in my area) really care about, it's about as common as speaking English.

Also an MPH is a very flexible degree. Coupled with your knowledge in nutrition, you stand to be able to get work in a variety of fields. "
publichealth,"Hi there!
I'm a student studying the general public's opinions on farming/ranching. If you would be so kind to take the survey I designed, that would be awesome!"
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,"I’m currently a study coordinator, hoping to be an epidemiologist!"
publichealth,Thank you! I never responded but really appreciated your response! I’m headed to Boston for admitted students’ day as we speak!
publichealth,Nope. I worked for a decade as an infectious disease epidemiologist with just a MPH. Do it for the love of the creepy crawlies...
publichealth,"Well, I took EHS 100 with Dr. Jackson and Dr. Hatfield, they were both super awesome and they know their stuff.  I'm pretty sure all the EHS students I've ever met were really nice as well. I think I play soccer with a few of them, but not sure!"
publichealth,"I have a background in Calc, so I can say it’s definitely easier than that, but it’s geared toward those who don’t have a lot of background in math. My TA was super helpful!"
publichealth,"In honesty, I'm a 2nd year PhD student, but I have been in your shoes fairly recently. However, I have no current job hunting experiences, but I'm not all that worried because I have an adaptable skill set.

I mean this in the nicest way possible, but when someone says they feel ready in their field, it's the first tip off that they have no idea what they're about to do. The more I get into this field, the more I feel like I don't know what the fuck I was thinking all the times before when I thought I understood it. However, I'm in a very different situation than you are though; I have 3 very different degrees, with MPH being my only true public health degree (my PhD is in applied health research).  I have both a MS (health research) &amp; a MPH (community health), but I do a lot of field research with people where I navigate between clinic and community settings. I love what I do, just as I'm sure you do, but it took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do. I just advise you to be cautious, do a MS or MPH program, make sure that's what you really love, because a PhD program will try to break you. Over and over again. 

If Harvard is telling you to do the MS program because they don't think you're ready for the PhD, trust them and do the MS program. They've seen your full resume and done a full review on you; they are the experts. You have a professor who is in your niche who wants you on your team; take the opportunity learn everything you can and then decide for your next degree if you want to stay or learn elsewhere.

One of the most useful pieces of advice I got at the end of my MPH program was at a meeting with several of my professors. They said every public health school or department has its own philosophy and understanding of the world of public health. In each program, learn what you can, but recognize each different school you go to will mold your view to fit their view.  Attending multiple programs and having multiple advisers will give you a more comprehensive view.  A PhD is a process and you have to remember to learn through the entire journey. "
publichealth,I am in hospital marketing (formerly in population health technology)
publichealth,"Yeah here it's similar. But i'd only spend 5 years after my MD specialising eg to be a cardiologist. I'm not yet sure how much clinical practice I will do. Your path is appealing as well. I guess I'll see when the time comes. "
publichealth,"I agree that they vary between institutions, but generally speaking, research assistant titles will be more entry level and you’ll probably have the best shot at those. I’d be very unlikely to recommend a recent grad without research experience for a coordinator position and I wouldn’t even bother applying to the research investigator or research scientist positions (though I’ve occasionally seen postings for entry level research scientists, but I think that is an atypical definition). Research technicians typically assist in a lab setting rather than human subjects research.


I know this is not helpful for you to hear, but in case it’s helpful for someone else - this is why it’s important to seek out research opportunities during undergrad. I suspect for every research assistant job you’re applying for, there are several candidates who already have a year or two of research experience.


Keep plugging away, something will stick eventually! "

Subject: APHA opens access to AJPH gun violence research


The actions of the students of Parkland, Florida, speak louder than words. Their courage in the wake of the mass shooting that took the lives of their classmates and school staff members reminds us all that we must do more to stop the violence and protect the public’s health.

&gt;From tragic mass shootings to suicides, too many preventable deaths and injuries in America involve a firearm. We know from decades of published research that a sound public health approach can reduce this deadly toll.

That’s why we have opened access to our collection of research papers, commentaries and essays on public health and firearms&lt;https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__action.apha.org_site_R-3Fi-3DR-5FkIiOakuqguJuA5b7dObQ&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=BSEKa4an1ZwnqPzKBhaOFfhSTFjvlKamMXPybAjNArc&amp;m=9UN7azIW1Cu9nl2aUNoBixcsMVH-Sisy7dH4ZIfVPpM&amp;s=dMBKV4lNJ_psECLtACg4B7CxStOrpofBuzjHF3xaTos&amp;e=&gt; published in the American Journal of Public Health. Key articles are now available to all, not just APHA members. Access to the research, data and findings is free of charge, with no subscription required. We hope this will contribute to greater collaboration and smarter evidence-based policies that enhance firearm safety and prevent injury and violence.

We also continue our legacy of strong public health advocacy in urging Congress to pass commonsense measures to reduce firearm violence. We urge you to join us and to speak out&lt;https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__action.apha.org_site_R-3Fi-3DQ-2DEyeiiqHgCHHCLVT8jdng&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=BSEKa4an1ZwnqPzKBhaOFfhSTFjvlKamMXPybAjNArc&amp;m=9UN7azIW1Cu9nl2aUNoBixcsMVH-Sisy7dH4ZIfVPpM&amp;s=0odhkz0wENa-s2XIYQ8r9i946VtxDmLdeQPkuMm6R3s&amp;e=&gt;.

"
publichealth,"Sorry but this is a bit confusing. You should make a list for yourself with pros and cons (including which job you think is more interesting), calculate what these jobs will get you moneywise and then decide. Or maybe if you present the two jobs more clearly, you will get better feedback.


"
publichealth,Yea no problem. Feel free to send me any questions you have regarding an MSW or just social work in general.
publichealth,"Yeah that's the major thing that's giving me pause about that one. I know it's weird. He didn't interview me, just told me the position is mine if I want it, and that he's away this week. He didn't give me a deadline to accept but the other position needs an answer this week and I want to be fair to both parties. 

It's just really intimidating having to make (what feels like) a big decision. Thank you both for the advice!"
publichealth,"Thanks! Philly came up as kind of a dark horse - I wasn’t expecting much but I loved my visit at Drexel and it seems like there’s a lot of growth happening there.

Also, being from Indiana I also have a healthy hatred of Tom Brady. Go Eagles!"
publichealth,I know some programs in the US offer tuition waivers for research assistantships. It doesn't hurt to ask for programs abroad?
publichealth,"Take the cheapest program. If you still want to go a PhD afterwards, it's still an option on the table and in theory, you won't even need to retake the GRE.

Public health is not a field that pays extremely well. You haven't mentioned what your focus would be (or it's possible I missed it), but I strongly advocate for the cheapest program. None of these programs are going to be inherently bad or without connections, but just think of how much better off you'll be when you do graduate."
publichealth,"Sorry - on a phone that doesn't seem to want to let me just reply.....

I'd email/call the school or course administrator and ask. Explain your background, skills etc and ask what options there would be. They should be able to give you a good idea. Good luck! "
publichealth,"You are right, I know I will never make bank (ever)...But I don't know how to quantify/do a cost-benefit-analysis of the kind of difference a more rigorous curriculum, better research fit, etc would make.... Would cost be your recommended deciding factor for anybody?"
publichealth,"Mph,ms, mpa "
publichealth,"I ran into a paywall. "
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,"GIS is in high demand, even on the local level. R is very popular on the federal level. Unfortunately, neither were mandatory for my MPH in EPI even though I would have liked to have learned GIS SO badly."
publichealth,"Why not both? Plenty of schools offer the MPH/MSW dual masters. Full disclosure I graduated with my MSW in 2015. I would say if you're really really reeeeeallly concerned about money social work is not going to be for you in the beginning or even until you get your LCSW (or whatever the equivalent might be) if you plan on going the clinical/therapy track. I do quality management and compliance and am making out okay financially, but I started this new position in May 2017 so exactly 2 years after I graduated. "
publichealth,"In my experience, there’s a lot of variation in the amount of aid available from different schools.

publichealth,"full disclosure: I'm getting my PhD in Epi, so take that for what it's worth. When I had the same question, my neighbor who who worked at the World Bank really pushed me towards Epi over biostat or environmental health. He said something along the lines of ""it may the most sexy thing, but the skills set you develop is applicable in every field"". 

outside of public health and bio-medical settings, I've been able to apply my methodological and analytical skill set in economics, personal finance, and non-health public policy arenas "

publichealth,"I've never lived in Boston, but I live Philly (MPH Biostats) and can speak to those strengths: There's a wonky statistic that gets passed around that suggests something like ""Philadelphia's universities produce the most health professionals in the nation"" with some requisite qualifiers and measures, I won't source it, but the jist is that there's a robust community of research universities, hospital networks, and health professionals that are driving employment trends here and it's all growth.  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is world famous, the billionaires at Penn Medicine fund an incredible amount of research, the Gift of Life Donor program sees the highest transplant traffic in the nation, we have maybe 3 or 4 NCI cancer centers, bio-pharma and insurance, the business end of things, have a strong presence with regional HQ's throughout Philly, Wilmington, Jersey, and the surrounding suburbs, all commutable under an hour (People even do the Phily to NYC thing, but I don't think that's at all reasonable).  It's a larger metro area than Boston, there's a deeper poverty rate, and so there's a large municipal public health bureaucracy that works on everything from health disparities to water treatment to disease surveillance.  

Realistically, a competent epi/biostats graduate with strong data skills can swing a job in any of the major coastal cities, so I really don't think you're at a loss in either program.  I do work with some BU grads and they've said that Boston is cleaner and has better transit, they miss it, but it's considerably more expensive and New England's winters are dark and brutal existential hellscapes.     

In closing, Boston did lose to the 2018 Superbowl LII World Champion Eagles and Tom Brady, whines, cheats, and is overrated.

publichealth,"I'm currently conducting research about tuberculosis in marginalized Moldovan communities, so this was an interesting read. A common concern expressed by these people was that they don't trust the medicine. They can tell where their pills come from; back in the day, when there were funds provided by external efforts/organizations, they received ""American"" pills. Now, the funding has run out and they can tell that the pills are of different origin (usually India), and are subsequently worse in terms of side effects and required dosage. Some have to take 20+ pills a day, but they know that more privileged TB patients, such as doctors, take far less than that. So I personally think that it comes down to funding the efforts of entire countries' medical systems. That said, funding is not a permanent solution, as money always runs out at some point. But the thing is, the medical professionals (at least in my research setting) simply don't care enough about the patients, especially the marginalized ones, such as homeless, drug users, prisoners, and rural villagers. They respond in Romanian when the patients speak Russian, they prescribe a ""one size fits all"" regimen to combat side effects, etc. Interestingly enough, treatment in prisons seems the best compared to other marginalized populations (at least in Moldova). There is one medical prison in the country, where the nurses are helpful and knowledgeable, and make adhering to treatment manageable because it is all provided within the confines of the prison. Unfortunately, when they are released back to regular prisons, they will most likely contract TB again, that's just how it goes. As for the other populations, social workers are the best bet because they actually treat them like people and put time and effort into providing care. But again, low funds are the problem... the one I worked at in Chisinau is likely being run out by another emerging one that has received $$$"

publichealth,"I think my question is why do you want to go straight into your PhD? And why will having a MPH instead of a MS hurt you with PhD applications (I think this depends on your discipline in public health, but I've never heard of a MPH hurting someone)? 

From how you're talking about these programs, it sounds like you should do Harvard. Cost is a negative yes, but that's the one you're excited about and the one that will have solid networking options for you with experts in your field. Usually, you aren't funded during your masters and then you are funded during your PhD. Plus it helps when you have an expert in your field you want to learn from. 

My personal experience: I wouldn't trade my MPH for anything because that's where I learned the basics of public health. I had so many worthwhile LIFE experiences (read: working with people, not just classroom knowledge) during my MPH program that it heavily influenced my PhD research. I am really glad I didn't rush into my PhD because it gave me time to figure out exactly what I wanted to do (which completely changed during my MPH program).  Chances are, you'll get publications and presentations wherever you go, so give yourself the best learning opportunities and enjoy the ride, however long that may take.  "

Since starting there I got my REHS cert with NEHA. I deal predominantly with sewage but I also cover most EH areas.

For the most part people are good, they understand the importance of your job. You will run into a-holes but don't let them get you down. You have to recognize why you do what you do. If someone asks why a rule is the way it is you had best be able to explain right there what that rule is protecting. 

The number one thing I think all EHS should keep in mind is the financial burden that you can put on a person or facility. I have restaurants that may only pull in $75 on a slow night. If I start telling them to fix this and that it could bankrupt the place. Do the best you can in the areas that will have the greatest impact on safety but don't go overboard. A broken floor tile never killed anybody, you can and should let some things slide. Talk with the owners about those things you might let slide, but don't be an a-hole.

publichealth,"Hi! I'm starting my JD/MPH this fall - since I haven't even begun a program yet, please take everything I say with a grain of salt. 

However, I have conducted ~40 informational interviews with JD/MPH students and graduates whose career goals fall all over the spectrum. Some are very passionate about working in impact litigation, others are doing regulatory work for government agencies, still others have moved into state health departments, hospital administration, family law, or to big law firms. At this point, I don't *think* I want to work in biglaw (you likely know this already, but while your salary will go up, in general you'll have little work/life balance and little control over what kind of clients you represent), I've also sat down with a few recruiters from major firms to pick their brains about the dual degree. 

I'm happy to share what I've learned thus far about the JD/MPH. I honestly didn't spend a lot of time considering the LLM - either joint degree option will be expensive, and I'd like to actually be able to practice law on the other side. I was worried that the LLM wouldn't be enough to get me hired in many places. From all of my conversations, public interest law is competitive and public health jobs are (unfortunately) poorly compensated in general. I didn't want to graduate with an LLM and compete for jobs with JD/MPH students. 

So, here's what comes to mind:

1.  Make sure you really, really need the joint degree for the kinds of positions you want. I believe it can be a powerful combo, but it's a lot of time and money to put in if you don't end up using it on the other side. Maybe your dream job actually just needs an MPH - in which case, great! You've saved yourself a lot of heartache and debt.

2. Work for a few years after undergrad - ideally in public health, though getting some experience with law would be great too. This will help you narrow down your career goals and ensure that you really want the joint degree. It also will give you a little more credibility - I've heard some employers are nervous when someone goes straight from undergrad into two graduate programs. Employment experience will show that you know how to navigate a workplace and can bring something else to the table other than your academics. 

3. Get the highest possible GPA you can. I can't stress this one enough - it *really* matters for law school. The higher your GPA, the more likely you are to get into and get scholarships from highly ranked schools. I mentioned that public health law jobs are competitive - while it's unfortunate that rankings matter, they do. You'll be in a better position if you can go to a good school on a sizable scholarship. Keep in mind that you'll be competing against other JD applicants who took easy classes all the way through just to maintain their 4.0. I was a bio major who loved taking challenging classes - while my GPA is great for my undergrad school and program, it's hurt me in this application process.

4. Take an LSAT prep course and don't be afraid to retake the exam. I only took it once, but wish I'd taken it again. 2-3 extra points might have led to acceptances instead of waitlists at some schools and far more scholarship money from others. You can't control your GPA after you graduate, but you can control your LSAT score by practicing and repeating if need be. 

5. Take a detailed look at the faculty and programs at all the schools you consider. The best ""public health law"" schools aren't necessarily the highest ranked - you'll need to decide for yourself if you want the higher overall ranking, or the better public health law program. 

6. Look for faculty at the school of public health who have JDs and keep an eye out for law clinics, concentrations, and externships that have a public-health related focus. 

7. Learn the difference between health law and public health law. For whatever reason, I conflated these for a while - they are very, very different. 

8. Network and do informational interviews! Everyone loves a prospective student - I've met so many great people with diverse careers through this process. Your university's career services people likely can start the process by connecting you with alums in the field. You can also reach out to law and public health professors at the schools you'd consider - they can likely connect you with alumni in the field. 

9. Be aware that there *can* be some stigma against attorneys with dual degrees. I've heard this from some people, while others have never encountered it. Basically, some have said that private law firms are skeptical of people with dual degrees, as it shows that they might not actually want to work there. If private law isn't one of your career goals, you probably won't encounter this. I did speak to a recruiter practicing health law in a large firm who told me they don't consider applicants with dual degrees or LLMs. 

10. Think about how you'll finance the degree. If you have access to funds through family/savings/investments, you'll be better off than financing it through loans. Many law programs, particularly the higher ranked ones, have loan repayment assistance programs. The details vary school by school, but basically the school will help you pay off your loans if you work in the public sector and make under a certain threshold. Be careful though - many of these programs are built on top of the federal public service loan forgiveness program. This program is currently on the chopping block in Congress, and it's unclear how it might change in the next few years. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to talk through the application process, since that's what I know best at this point. I'm lucky to be deciding between a number of great programs, each of which offers unique opportunities.

Right now Tableau is also trendy program in analysis, and other languages such as python and SQL are being used as well. Best of luck! "

I'm in the USA. I checked job listings for the CDC a few weeks ago and most seemed to require a specialized degree such as biostatistics or epidemiology. But that might be aiming too high without any experience in the field.   "
publichealth,"I like SAS as a tabling language, the DATA step can be incredibly useful for standard data sources, and I think the systemic logs are a lot easier to debug from than other languages (In R, you're sort of dependent on the specific package as to whether you'll get useful error messages).  For a lot of basic data maneuvers and stats work, SAS will output the relevant diagnostics and statistics by default and this is really convenient.  With some ODS statements, you can generally manage a nice workflow with readable code and reproducible elements. 

For just about anything that SAS has a canned report for, that would be my preference, but for anything SAS doesn't do automatically or that might be more advanced than an entry level multivariate course, it's really not worth my time to muck around with Macros/TEMPLATE/REPORT/IML or any of the customization features and I would go straight to R.  

I think your best bet at first is SAS.  It will get you job interviews and I think the standard analyses (generally) encourage good statistical practice, whereas R is a bit more like the wild wild west, with limitless possibilities.  You will never want for a procedure, graphic, report, calculation, or literally anything in data science if you can work in R, but you probably need to know what you don't know and have some idea of what you need to understand to get the best results.  

(Also, SAS university edition (the freebie) is kind of a pain.  It runs on a virtual machine and this can be kind of wonky.  I would choose R with R Studio over this version just to avoid hiccups)"
publichealth,"Sounds like you need to get to the [Academic &amp; Health Policy Conference on Correctional Health](https://www.accjh.org/conference) March 22-23, 2018. Houston, TX."
publichealth,"What do you think about applying for something in my State's ""Department of Health""?"
publichealth,Is there a general guideline on how a person might qualify for need-based?
publichealth,"I mean, I'm applying to data analysis jobs right now, and am looking at the requirements. My fiancee and all my friends work at CDC and utilize SAS heavily. Perhaps their groups are still sticking with SAS..."
publichealth,"Super appreciate this perspective; I was hoping people would comment with additional thoughts &amp; perspectives and yours is excellent.

I still think this adds to a body of literature on the subject that seems to be leaning away from opiate prescription on a wide scale, and for that reason I think it's beneficial. Agreed that more study - and more thoughtful study - is required."
publichealth,"No, I don't do any data analysis, it's mostly all field work. When someone tests positive, I go out and find the person, give them their results, get them into treatment (for syphilis sometimes that means driving them to the clinic, for HIV it's just scheduling their initial appointment and following up to be sure they go), and interview patients for risk factors and all sexual partners, needle-sharing partners, and any others who might be high risk. Then I go find all those people, notify them of their exposure, test them either with an instant test or draw their blood to send to a lab, depending how recent the exposure they may get treatment as well, and interview them to find additional information on others who may be at risk.

Very recently, I did get to take part in a case review of a fetal transmission, which is slightly more toward the epi/data analysis side of things. I was asked to do this special type of in-depth interview with a mom, then came back and reported to the review team. It included a lot of epis, researchers, and community partners. We also reviewed her medical records from throughout the pregnancy and identified missed opportunities before pregnancy, prenatally, perinatally, and post to see what where all the factors that led to the transmission. It was like a big brainstorming session, and the results will hopefully lead to system-wide changes that may help prevent it happening to others in the future. An example of that that they noted is tackling transportation issues-they found that Medicaid-contracted transportation doesn't allow moms to bring children with them unless they're seeing a provider too, so they would have to find care for their older children while attending prenatal appointments...which led to missed appointments and moms falling out of care, not keeping viral loads in check, and transmission to baby. They're now working with legislators to get a bill written that would allow additional passengers to accompany a patient.

This was the first time in a little over a year of employment in this role that I've been involved in something like that, and as much as I'd like to do more of it, it's probably going to be pretty rare. I was asked to do this particular case because their usual interviewers were farther away and unable to get to this area as soon as they wanted the interview done."
publichealth,"Thank you for the information! That’s something I will look into further. "
publichealth,"why do you need 2 1- year programs? The cost? I feel like a 2-year biostatsPH would be more rewarding. The whole first year of my MPH program was learning the basics. "
publichealth,"I did Epi Scholars, which is similar but a bit more selective (and only for Epi MPH students). It was a fantastic experience and I highly recommend doing HRTP. 

The selection process for Epi Scholars, and I believe it’s similar for HRTP as well, is that first the people running the programs (it’s the same team doing both) review the applications. If you’re approved by them, they’ll let you know and send you a list of projects that DOHMH staff have applied to get an intern for. You send them your list of favorites, and then they send your information to the people who have requested an intern- those people choose who to interview and offer internships to. The number of slots open each year depends on how many people have signed up to get an intern, so it varies each year, but it’s usually a pretty big group for HRTP. 

Don’t feel shy about reaching out to the HRTP team with any questions you have- they’re a lovely bunch and very helpful. "
publichealth,"As far as I can tell, it isn't CEPH accredited. (They say the classes are aligned, but I don't see anything about actual accreditation and there's nothing about them on the CEPH degree search on their website.)

In short: don't do it if you want your degree to be worth a damn."
publichealth,"I would also consider options that are outside the traditional purview of public health as a method of applying public health principles and knowledge to those issues/communities/people. I think public health professionals have a very useful insight in how health plays into things such as poverty, community design and layout, access to transportation etc. You might be that person that brings that great new insight or revelation to a group and allows them to better understand how health plays into whatever their focus is. 

My last volunteering opportunity was supporting a farm-based school. We helped guide the director towards building up his curriculum and recruiting his first group of students. I enjoyed it, because it was local, unique, and I had a strong non-profit and public health background that allowed me to help steer the decision-making process. Also, it was great for the resume, so I was able to gain something invaluable (resume padding!) from the experience. Professionally I also served on an homelessness board, which again, I was able to provide a lot of insight in how we can tackle health issues for the homeless.  

I would also ask yourself why are you volunteering. If you just want to serve your community or a certain topic really puts a spark in you, then definitely go that direction. If you are looking to expand your career options in the future, I would consider where you are and where you want to go and how volunteering can put you on potential employer's radars. Volunteering can be a great way to network because you can make connections now while you don't necessarily need anything from the person. They will be much more willing to recommend you for a position if you you've been working on this volunteer project for X number of years.

publichealth,"Hi! Thanks a lot for the info! I'm really excited about UCLA since it's my first choice and loved the faculty and campus when I visited. Did you feel like the EHS classes, while rigorous, were doable? Why was it rigorous in your opinion? 

Unfortunately, I am out of state so I would be paying that tuition. However, I got my preliminary financial aid from UCLA and it is ~60k (including everything) and Tulane's is ~59k. There is not much of a difference per year! I do plan on becoming a CA resident to at least get that tuition benefit my second year. Do you know the process of that by any chance?

Thanks for all your help!"
publichealth,"Good looks "
publichealth,Merit funding from where? Not all schools have that requirement.
publichealth,"If you don't mind me asking, what level of debt (over 30K, 50K, 80K..etc.) "
publichealth,Always assume a statement containing the word “always” is false.
publichealth,It’s a bummer that not much is different. Did they at least move the lounge and computer lab out of the A level? (Or make the A level nicer?) I remember getting lost and walking to a loading dock my first time trying to find that lab for stats...
publichealth,How would I go about asking?
publichealth,"When I interviewed for a health educator/child care health consultant job, I was told ahead of time that I would need to give a ~5 minute mock training. So I prepared a few PowerPoint slides and a hands-on activity. Both went well, but the interview panel really got into the hands on activity, at first surprised that I actually wanted them to complete it (rather than 'pretend' it since it was a mock training after all). What type of outreach does this position cover? Maybe you could do something similar?"
publichealth,What’s that? Can you go more into detail?
publichealth,"County Director for a district of three rural health departments! Also with threes: the number of masters I decided I needed for some crazy reason. I used to have a CHES, but I got tired of fooling with it."
publichealth,"Just graduated with a BS with a concentration in Health Promotion and Behavioral Science. Trying to get an entry level job with my municipal health departments. Am considering going for an MPH in Epi just because I really enjoyed looking more at data and trends as an undergrad so maybe it will be a good fit for me. "
publichealth,"Long story short, it really depends on what you want to do but it's certainly possible to get ahead without any clinical degree or experience.

What sort of gigs are you looking for?"
publichealth,"Let's set the MPH aside for a second.  If you want to be an industrial hygienist, you need an understanding of chemistry, some physics, and at least a decent amount of biology including anatomy/physiology.

I majored in bio, on a premed track, so I had to take a year of physics, chem, organic chem, and so on.  It helped me a lot, not just in doing the job, but in getting my foot in the door in the first place.  Some government jobs I've applied for required chem, math, etc coursework to be eligible, even for relatively entry-level positions.

I wouldn't mess around with a post-bac or anything, just start taking chemistry classes at your local community college.  Anatomy is important too, as is physics 1, and a calc class.  If you can get organic chem under your belt, that would be awesome.

If you want to get into a specifically IH degree program, they may require some or all of that, it depends.  Generalist MPH programs do not.  Either way, before you spend money on an MPH, invest the time in yourself to get the pre-reqs done for the career, THEN learn what you can in an MPH.  Just my $0.02"
publichealth,Thanks for the response! I’m taking a few gap years before pursuing my MPH. I learned a little bit of R in undergrad. I’m thinking about trying to learn the basics of R and SAS before I go to grad school. Which would you say is more widely used in public health data analysis &amp; evaluation?
publichealth,"&gt;My Catholic parents would be less than happy with me working at PP

Does that also rule out LGBT HIV patient advocacy organizations? Because those are also going to fit the criteria of your interests. How about community clinics that target immigrant communities? Community organizations that serve youth?

If you are a master troll, maybe get yourself hired at one of those terrible pregnancy crisis centers and undermine them by offering patients *inclusive and medically accurate reproductive health information*.

&gt;But as for your comment about being sticklers for having masters degree, do many public health employers stick hard and fast to other ""requirements""? If it says ""1-3 years experience required"", are they strict on that?

Government jobs are very strict on this. That's why I recommend CBO's for n00bs like yourself."
publichealth,"I’m in environmental health and plan on commissioning as an officer  in either the Navy or the Public Health Service "
publichealth,"Hi there - I'm actually trying to switch out of the program management/administration stuff into a more direct ""science"" role. My undergrad was in science and I just kind of fell into a more administrative/management role after graduation. So my hope was that an MPH would help me transition into doing the actual science portion of health sciences research, versus the admin side. I don't actually know if this path makes sense, which is kind of why I ask the question. I know I'm interested in public health as a subject, but not sure how to move my current experience into that realm.

Do you find the online format is manageable with working full time? Also - I know a big point of school is networking - do you feel like the online program is missing that aspect?"
publichealth,I was considering becoming an REHS after graduating instead of going to grad school right away. Is that what you did?
publichealth,"Thanks so much, that was all really helpful! That career assistance is what I'm really looking for in a program. "
publichealth,I'm glad to see money is being donated.  It's a shame that it's only $15 Million.  Public Health needs much more funding than this.

publichealth,"Your local health department’s positions with health promotion or health education. Possibly non profits like planned parenthood. "
publichealth,"Nope, not at CDC. Definitely a decade ago, but R went over the tipping point above SAS a few years ago for new positions. I don't know about Northrup Grumman, but most of their positions are in DC anyway, not Atlanta."
publichealth,"For the Airforce, an MPH in any field is acceptable to commission as a public health officer "

Health communications and promotion actually sound quite interesting, especially if I can incorporate the nutritional aspects. As for social media and communications, I can potentially work within this field for a health retailer who I current work for, however, I wanted to move away from digital. If it's a growing area of interest within PH, it may be something that I look into though.

Edit: Do you also think an digital insights/analytics role would benefit me? I have an opportunity in this area which I'm tempted by, but not if it moves me away from the direction I'm looking to eventually take."

publichealth,"Cost would be the thing I would be putting the most weight on, but it also depends on what you're looking into. Health Promotion/Behavior has significantly different potential career tracks (and therefore, earning power) than a Biostatistician, for example.

I think having a real, sincere ""come to Jesus"" kind of talk with yourself should always happen. Imagine the very worst case scenario: graduating without a job and no real career path after and the realistic (not the damn rose tinted glasses that admissions marketing would have you buy into). Obviously, the more debt you have, the worse it will be, which is why money and cost should carry a very significant weight.

But geographic area and cost of living (during and after school), job network should also play a role. If you can also get a list of classes and syllabi for potential classes to get an idea of skills you'll learn, that's also important. "

publichealth,"#GO BEARS.

Cal has a dedicated program in infectious diseases, which is pretty rare these days. And if that isn't enough, their epi program is pretty solid. Berkeley students have a lot of internship opportunities. CDPH (CA state health department) has offices in Richmond, which is a short BART ride away. Berkeley has a city health department, but there's also Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Solano County, SF city/county, San Mateo County, etc...

That being said, I'm an epi in LA. Spent like 10 years boots on the ground in the field. I went to USC (after undergrad at Cal), but many of my colleagues went to UCLA, and they are all pretty damn good at what they do. Their epi methods curriculum is excellent. The big drawback is the commute between UCLA (Westwood) and LA County DPH (DTLA). I mean it's *really* bad.

FWIW, I have to give a shoutout to USC for training me well. I'm pretty good at what I do. So if you wanna spend like another $15k on your masters, consider going Trojan."
publichealth,"""war"" really?  This sensationalist stuff really takes away from the legitimacy of our purpose."
publichealth,"Google scholar is amazing for academic journal articles, try looking there"
publichealth,What are your masters in? Wow!
publichealth,"there is no standard curriculum for health science. Often times it is a major designed for pre-med and pre-dental students to meet their prereqs to apply to med or dental school. 

Truthfully, what you do post graduation from your undergrad and before dental school is really dependent on what experiences you have gained during undergrad. What kind of skills do you have? "
publichealth,Music to my ears! Thanks!
publichealth,"I would start by getting to know your neighbors, and even try discussing public health with them to get their thoughts. Volunteering with existing organizations / non-profits can also be hugely beneficial. DPH near you may also have volunteer opportunities.

And we're trying to do something about it."
publichealth,Sent you PM
publichealth,"What aspect of infectious disease? Do you want to work on patients directly? Lobby for new legislation? Be at the front lines of disease research? Do you want to work globally or at the state level? 

In general the answer is no because there are so many areas of infectious disease to go into but if there’s something specific you have your heart set on then yes; you would need a MD to work on clinical patients who have infectious diseases."
publichealth,"I would probably recommend BU, but here's my take:

- I wouldn't study outside the US if my goal was to work inside the US.   

- A year less of study is a year less of study.  (If it's in the medical school, I would imagine the program is oriented for MD's)

- In any PH program you should really strive to maximize application with methods.  MS and MPH study can be really similar to each other pending which electives you select. 

- Some analytic positions like to see that you've published, some like to see that you've worked, and many won't even make the distinction after you've worked a year or two altogether.  

"
publichealth,"Grad school was never a consideration for me, I knew I was just going for a bachelors. Then again I never had a desire to go into public health, I just kind of landed here and liked the job."
publichealth,Certainly! I'll PM you.
publichealth,"My understanding, as an MPH student, is that GIS skills are in high demand in public health. I've had several professors specifically asking around for graduate research assistants who know GIS. Even though it's not currently offered in my program, I am planning on taking a semester of GIS.

I wish I could be more helpful with resources, but the sense I get is that it's a lot easier for someone with a strong GIS/analysis background to pick up the public health stuff and get a job than it is for someone like me with an MPH to pick up the GIS skills. It seems like you shouldn't have to go back to school for a PhD, but if you feel like you really need to bone up on public health maybe you could try doing some of the very good free Coursera MOOCs from Johns Hopkins and see what you think?

"
publichealth,My understanding with the HPV vaccine is that it is only effective if given to teens/young adults prior to becoming sexually active since HPV exposure/infection is otherwise quite high. Is this correct?
publichealth,"In public health it is! The market is so saturated with MPHs that OP is currently holding the equivalent of an associates degree. "
publichealth,google is free
publichealth,"Sorry, I should clarify. “We” as in the local health department.  We have DIS and then we also have MAs and providers. We definitely give patients the opportunity to notify their partners on their own, but yes, usually we do just go ahead and initiate the investigation. It’s a fun (and sometimes really stressful) job! After all, you are literally the bearer of bad news."
publichealth,"If your community has one, I'd recommend getting involved with some type of harm reduction group. But, find something you're passionate about and find a way to volunteer."
publichealth,"Oh! That's probably the case. My university has a Citrix SAS app that goes onto a server in one of our buildings. I have to let them know if I plan to put any HIPAA sensitive data into it because I have to a put it on a different server. "
publichealth,That's great! I'm thinking about an associate in nursing as well.
publichealth,"Harm reduction, I’ll have to look into that! "
publichealth,"Thanks for the response. Do you have any suggestions for online courses that teach the subject of epidemiology? This has probably been asked before on this sub so I'll definitely search around. "
publichealth,"I did my undergrad at UNC. I did not do my MPH or PhD at UNC because I wanted to be in a smaller program. Chapel Hill is a great place, the professors are knowledgeable and helpful, and there are so many learning and networking connections. Honestly I loved it, but I was in-state and quite affordable. 

I think it all just goes back to what you're comfortable with. All the top schools of public health are pretty big, which is actually pretty nice during a master's program. I personally function better in a smaller department with more 1-on-1 time with my adviser so I went elsewhere. "
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"If you're able to function as an adult and drive a fancy truck, you can provide your own insurance "
publichealth,"I applied for some MSc (Master of Science) degrees in specific areas (e.g., epidemiology, biostatistics) in addition to applying to an MPH program in Europe. I do not know if it is true, but I would think the MSc degrees would be more accepted in the USA than the MPH, since the MSc degrees don't fall under the same accreditation body. The MSc degree would perhaps also be more focused learning such that it will be more obvious to future employers whether or not you know what you're doing. Are you hoping to do any additional schooling (e.g., PhD) after the Master's degree? "
publichealth,"Well you and I go to the same school, looks like I need to pay more attention - although I suppose that's what I get for taking 19 credits this semester. The topic comes up all the time in my classes through professors or guest speakers, I just have yet to meet anyone focused on making that their crusade mission. "
publichealth,"It all depends on what you want to do.  PH is a huge field, and there are very few skills that have absolutely no place in the field.

If you want to do EH, look for stuff like EH technician, food inspector, sanitarian (you often need a license for that, but a place that hires sanitarians also hires techs), and safety jobs.

If your heart isn't in EH I'm not sure, it depends on you.

Also, who told you that the MPH is needed for hands on experience?  That's flat out wrong.  Most of the hands on stuff, especially in EH, is done by technicians.  An MPH can be awesome (again, it depends on what you want to do) but isn't necessary to get into the field."
publichealth,"I’m currently doing MPH dual degree at UGA. One thing you didn’t mention is that traffic absolutely sucks in Atlanta.

I personally would never want to live in Atlanta again and I love UGA. The teachers in the program all have little quirks about them that can get on someone’s nerves if they take life too seriously. I’m doing HPBR which is definitely different and hadn’t taken a policy class yet.

I have a friend who did HPAM and he works at the CDC. I also have a friend who did HPBR and she works at the CDC as well as ORISE fellows. The MPH internship allows you to pick so if you have connections at Emory or CDC you could intern there but get the MPH from UGA. 

If you’re really trying to be a public health super star, maybe Emory will be better. I’m personally trying to start my own business in the process so I really couldn’t care about high up government positions. I think I could help freelance grant writing after my internship so far and I could help evaluate programs possibly. 

Emory probably has a lot better curriculum and education. At the same time is it worth the money? Maybe you can just stay with your dad when you have your internship and do it at Emory, that sounds like the ideal to me.

I’ll also mention that the public health program has been super flexible. I’m taking biostatistics online and I’m taking another online class in the summer for the dual degree (MSW). They also offer much more flexible schedules than my other degree. 

Most people end up finding work I believe after the degree but it depends where you want to work, what you want to do, and who you know. "
publichealth,"Actually the area where the school is isn't bad, it's just the street the school is located on. But it lends itself quite well to the program, being on the same street as a homeless shelter. It gives life to the public health issues we read about"
publichealth,"Well maybe it's just my location. Around here I've had a tough time even qualifying for entry level stuff without an MPH. Most of my friends have gone straight to mph because of this but I lack funds and path to commit to a degree. I'm excited about the EH position but I'm not sure if it's for me yet, I know the clinical stuff isn't for me though. Around me, even with internships, it seems like you need an MPH. It's maddening. "
publichealth,"Thank you! By the looks of your username it seems you are a UNC student, any chance you can give some insight on your experience? Did you do the MPH? Health behavior?"
publichealth,"Is this a proposal for actual research that you plan to conduct, or do you just have to put something together that shows you understand the key components of a research proposal?"
publichealth,"That sounds awesome! Was this your first position after your MSPH, or did you work up to it?"
publichealth,"What I might just do is freelance and grant write from another country and get paid by us companies. I wouldn’t necessarily live in one country, but they would all ideally have healthcare I could access for cheap. I also don’t plan on having children, and have done many many other things besides simply get a degree. If you want to do public health, I think it would at least be recommendable to understand the grant writing process and to read the grants of the organization you work for. There are some things you must do because the grant says so, and there are other things the company does that the grant doesn’t specify. 

It’s nice to also understand why the program runs the way that it does, it’s generally created around funding opportunities. Because I like my business idea instead, I choose to do that :). But having a back up is always nice. Health promotion and behavior literally shows you how to implement a program from start to finish. You could even copyright a program manual and make plenty of cash. It can also be applied to a business model fairly easily in terms of HR and employee training and stuff. I could see myself doing more HR work as a health promotion and behavior specialist. 


With regards to 70k, you might be able to make your own business in consulting, it’s really about how you market yourself and who you know. I really don’t know much about you or your experiences, but this isn’t some panacea. They definitely won’t teach you how to be healthy and the program isn’t in my opinion one a healthy one. We sit down for 3 hours in a room with no windows. This is just like any office possibly, but you can have an MPH and not exactly be healthy. 

At UGA they definitely don’t focus on nutrition or chronic disease for that matter. My professor is the only chronic disease professor, and she told me that I couldn’t talk about nutrition for the rest of the semester. It’s probably because she things eggs are healthy but that’s another story. 

Anyways. If you already kind of know what you want and have a strong work ethic, UGA will be fine. If you’re flying on the school to get you 70,000k or Even any public health position, I doubt it will happen unless you have 2-3 years experience and even then it might not happen, it all depends on the organization and how you respond to their offers."

publichealth,"I'd say it comes down to what you'll enjoy in your career.   I started the MPH Health Promotion and didn't feel it was a good fit.  Halfway through I moved to MPH Policy focus and added Epi as a minor.

Health Promotion may have more jobs, but my opinion is that more of them will be entry-level.   You'll get a lot more contact with the public, but maybe less prestige.  Epi is great unless you get bored in the office setting or  get tired of stats.

I suggest starting where you are interested, but add extra courses from the other track as electives to feel them out.  Personally, I think MPH:Epi with a CHES would check most boxes off for you to have wide options.

Ultimately, all MPH has the same core so you'll have basic competency across the tracks.   Also, I rarely get asked what MPH track I did... Mostly it's about my past jobs, internships, and thesis project.

Good luck!"
publichealth,"That's a great opening. I'm a veterinarian and have an MPH, but I'm way more interested in public health policy than clinical medicine. Not everyone can be a doctor, but the public health fields have more opportunities at all levels and many are just as if not more rewarding than medicine. "

publichealth,"Hi @the_sherm! I was recently admitted for the CHS MPh at UCLA. Why did you choose UCLA if you were deciding between other schools? I'm also wondering how prepared you felt entering into the workforce? Finally, what was your interest area in public health? Hope you don't mind the questions :) "
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,"I'm not aware of any surveys that track that metric. If this is for class, you're doing this the hard way. Pick a survey, see what it asks, then pick two measured variables to correlate. This may seem inappropriate, but if you were actually a researcher, you'd already know what was available. "
publichealth,"Just to speak of academic research:  Programming and meeting with research teams and reading through Reddit between projects takes up most of my time.  I get to audit classes and sit in on interesting lectures, sometimes we score game tickets or get premium spots at whatever event is happening on campus, but this is all fringe benefits to working for a university.  

When I first started as something akin to a biostatistician (non-faculty researcher), all I did was merge/format/clean datasets and run p-values.  The worst part was just formatting the output into something presentable (""Hey, can we get descriptive stats on all 3000 variables and can you make it fit on one page so that it's readable?"").  It could get boring, but I worked on so many different projects that there was always a fresh problem to dive into.  Now, I still do some of these tasks, but I'm also more directly involved in project planning, authorship, and interesting analytic work. 

Honestly, it's a lot of fun.  Other researchers might focus on one problem or aspect of health their entire career.  In biostats, you can work on anything and virtually everyone is happy to have you on their team or grant.

publichealth,"I did AmeriCorps for a year and got a nonprofit job afterwards, where I've been for 2.5 years. I'm on my way to starting my MPH in the fall; at that point I'll have been out of school for over 4 years.

Honestly, I don't like my job that much (it's not in public health and it's quite boring), but I'm very glad I've spent the past few years working. It's helped me develop professional skills and get my finances together. Plus, I feel I have more focus and drive after a few years of figuring out my interests.

OP, I'd recommend some kind of national service program, like AmeriCorps. You'll be dead broke for a year, but will gain decent skills and be much more employable afterward."
publichealth,How the hell is this stuff still legal..???
publichealth,FYI $35k/year is $17.5/hour unless you give up all vacation days. This is important because places that pay hourly wages usually don’t have paid time off.
publichealth,"Sincerely sorry for the delay here!

I applied for, and was in, the summer program. Looking back at my emails, seems like it was around late-March or early-April when I started receiving callbacks. So, definitely a fair amount of time had elapsed. It did feel like I was cutting it close.

I really enjoyed the team I worked for, and continue to be close with them. I found everyone to be super welcoming, grateful for the support, and genuinely interested in helping with my professional development. 

That it was unpaid was definitely a big drawback. If you get hired, you might consider asking your office (not the folks who run HRTP) if they can pay a part-time wage. I also received support from my school. If you haven't, it may be worth setting up a meeting with someone at your school to discuss options. 

Hope this helps!"
publichealth,"This. I know my workplace also has a Conflict of Interest review committee for industry sponsored research, in addition to the IRB/IACUC reviews. I am involved with it and generally there are ""management plans"" put in place where outside statisticians have to be used, peer reviewers have to check in on the research every three months, etc. Biased research probably makes it through, but paid for by industry doesn't necessarily mean biased. "
publichealth,"I’m currently in the UConn MPH program and was similarly worried that I would feel behind when it came to biostats/epidemiology. I had a really great Professor who made the concepts really understandable, even for someone who hadn’t taken a math class in four years. Unless you are applying to schools with specific pre-reqs, I don’t think it’s necessary for you to take more math (unless you think it will help on the GRE). Hope this is a helpful start! :)"

publichealth,"You treat patients? Does that mean your DISs are all nurses? We have a few local health departments that we take patients to for treatment. As DISs, we do all the field work and interviews for risk factors and partner elicitation. It's pretty rare that we allow patients to notify partners themselves, we're almost always going out to locate, notify, and test them ourselves (of course they can notify in the mean time, it's just that we don't rely on that)"
publichealth,"I do this for high school kids every year or so. I usually start by asking for a show of hands of who wants to be a doctor when they grow up. Then I ask them to describe why and use that conversation as a jumping off point for the public health careers that I'm familiar with. At the end they're a little less likely to want to be a clinician!
Also suggest that they take anthropology courses, many really insightful epi people that I've met came from an anthro background."

publichealth,"Honestly if the CDC wants to _science_ then have it, but saying things like this makes you look ill informed.

""Who is most likely to use a gun in a crime, and where does the gun come from? How often are guns used in domestic violence cases? How often are the people who are arrested for gun crimes the same individuals who actually bought the weapons?""

Those answers are already out there. We _know_ the answers. We don't need the CDC to confirm them in order for the data to be ""real"".

The FBI, the DoJ, various Academic institutions, various think tanks, and various private bodies have _all_ done research and studies on these questions for decades now and the answers have not changed.

The problem isn't a lack of knowledge, it's a lack of will to do anything with it and that _isn't_ the fault of the NRA as many hard Blue states aren't even getting it correct and the NRA has near zero influence on their legislatures."

publichealth,"I think if you have the willpower, funds, and determination to become an MD you should just do that. Study epidemiology personally or part-time after you start working as an MD. Then when you are done with being an MD, move into public health/epi. Your bank account will thank you lol"
publichealth,Biostatistics.
publichealth,"As people recommend here, do it on the side, an MD without practice doesn't bring XYC to the table...

Don't forget that titles count. 

If you work for an government agency you may need to show the Epi title in order to get that job. Same with MD, yet won't actually need the clinical practice. 

So, I definitely would recommend to go for it, but do both in an official manner. 

So that 5 years later you can work internationally and have a paper to show your training without having to explain but I studied on the side etc. If you fill out those job applications at WHO and all those orgs, they need the fact that you have an MPH or an MD."
publichealth,"Wow, there's a lot (not surprising) to it. Thank you for explaining it all to me! I just have to be more patient."
publichealth,"I graduated from UGA's policy and management program, and was admitted to both UGA and Emory so I can at least share my perspective on having made this choice.

I'm sure that UGA's program has improved since I graduated, but I felt that I definitely missed out academically by not going to Emory. Also, in terms of jobs and networking, Emory (from what I've seen) does a much better job.  That being said, I know people from both programs who work together at the CDC, so if you network well and get a good internship both degrees will get you the same place.

Why did I choose UGA? Cost. Emory is very expensive, and I think you've downplayed the relative difference in the costs. Emory's tuition is going to probably be closer to $70k with fees and everything factored in ($16,900/semester).  UGA would be less than $25k (it's $4,773/semester).  So you have to ask yourself, is the education that I would be receiving at Emory worth an extra $45k?  "
publichealth,Never heard of this test and I have my masters. What’s it for?
publichealth,"&gt; I actually considered USC, but my mentor kinda discouraged me from applying to programs rather than schools. 

I honestly don't get the rationale for this. the USC MPH program is within the medical school and is backed by a pretty distinguished faculty.

&gt;what made you choose it over schools of public health like UCLA? 

UCLA specifically, I got in as a undergrad, but when I went to visit, I found myself viscerally hating West LA. But more broadly, I didn't apply to higher ranked programs because I took such a hard beating at Berkeley as an undergrad that my self-esteem was in a hole in the ground. I didn't apply because I didn't feel worthy. That was dumb. I regained my confidence in grad school. Despite all that, I love Berkeley very much and would not have traded that experience for anything. And I appreciate the time I spent at USC because they trained me well.

&gt;And another personal question but do you work at LADPH or some other health department? What's the work day like? Do you enjoy it and feel full filled by it? 

Yep. I spent 10 years as a boots-on-the-ground epi. Literally boots. I always wore Doc Martens during environmental health inspections. I got to do large-scale outbreak investigations. My disease surveillance has trigered multi-state product recalls. I have published case reports about some weird, rare, and freaky shit. LA County is an excellent place to work because of the endless opportunities for publication. We get zebras. Lots of them. Do I feel fulfilled working here? Yeah, I guess. I'd rather win the Power Ball and drop everything to travel the world, but as far as jobs go, this isn't bad. 

&gt;How hard was it to get that first position?

HR is arcane. When the time comes for you to apply, PM me, and I will walk you through it."
publichealth,"CDC postings come up infrequently, and federal hiring has been very restrained under this administration.  For federal PH GIS jobs, you'd likely be looking at a relocation to a physical point of presence for CDC, or DC with another federal agency.  There are likely GIS contract jobs out there that would fit your interest, but usually those are advertised by individual contractors, and there really isn't a centralized job board for prospective applicants to track."

publichealth,"Generally it seems that if you want to work in the US, you should probably go to school in the US. The CEPH accreditation is very important here, and a US school will have more opportunities to network domestically. It can be difficult to evaluate the quality of a non-CEPH-accredited degree, since there are specific standards and metrics CEPH-accredited schools must meet.

I'm personally of the opinion that you should try to get your degree in the country you want to work it. Networking is huge in public health."

I know that most other schools do not require that you disclose parents' income if you are independent at this point.

publichealth,"&gt;School Services - I've heard that UCB's public health school doesn't offer much career support and that you're left to your own devices.

Considering I just ate and drank my way through a Berkeley Career Center networking event (that I wasn't even invited to!) last night, I call *BS* on this claim. The Career Center is there if you need them, but so many students don't take full advantage of their resources. On top of that, the Cal alumni network is very supportive, especially if you leave the East Bay.

And while dietetics isn't part of that MPH program, you can work with the SPH to add it in if you'd like. Cal offers all the undergrad courses necessary to qualify for the RD. You can add them as electives to your course schedule.

I would ask the SPH to work with you on crafting a program that will help you reach your career goals. ***GO BEARS***"

publichealth,"Look into Epidemiology programs. One of our faculty describes Epi as the intersection between math, medicine/health, and philosophy/epistemology. Epidemiological methodology is the cornerstone of the evidence-based medicine movement that has changed health care delivery and education in the last couple decades

Unfortunately, some clinicians who fail to understand these methods still have difficulty discerning good literature from bad, mostly relying on an article's popularity as a proxy for its quality. Better understanding of the methods and analyses that support the underlying medical evidence is required to prevent the reversion to eminence-based medicine that has failed in the past"

publichealth,"Posting your full name and the full company name to reddit.com could be potentially legally damaging to you and undermine your position right at the moment that you need to protect it.

I would recommend that, if the authorities concerned are not taking action that you feel is necessary or adequate, you take your story to a reputable press organization. This way at least you will have some level of protection. If your country has a [“whistleblower” law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower), you should look into whether it may also provide protection.

Because you have provided your full name and the full company details, your post to /r/publichealth has been removed. This is entirely for *your* protection.

"
publichealth,"Victim Advocate? Did you work as a liaison between law enforcement and victims of sexual assault? If you don’t mind telling me more. "
publichealth,"Sort of?

So, the way it worked where I volunteered (and this may be different from area to area), but what would happen is either someone would call into our phone line and request to speak to someone and volunteers were on call all day if it was the weekend, or the off-hours when the center for this wasn't open. These kinds of calls were rare.

What we experienced more commonly is that either a parent (kid cases were always shitty), guardian, or the victim would go to either the police or to an ER. From there, either the police or a SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) Nurse would call us and we'd get notified and asked to come in.

We generally sat with the victims while they got an exam done (if in hospital) and were asked questions by the police (if they were there--they weren't always called, depending on victim preference and situation). Got them things to drink, helped get their mind off the shitty parts of the exam, etc. But the most important part was just treating them like a person. It's a really dehumanizing experience in the first place, and the way our justice system is set up doesn't help.

I would also always provide a folder of things for them as a resource. Some victims don't call right away to get help, but just letting them know there was always a free option in the community if they ever needed it."

publichealth,"All government institutions use SAS. We learned STATA in my MSPH program and it has definetly been a struggle in my job now (I'm an epi). I convinced them to buy me a licence because it's not too expensive and I just don't have the time to learn SAS, but a lot of programs for our analyses were already written in SAS so starting from scratch has been a headache. If I could go back to school and do it all over again, I'd definetly take some SAS classes. I hate not being able to put that on my resume. "
publichealth,"Does this position come with benefits? That’s something to consider, as it adds to your total cost to the company for employing you. Also, the cost of getting you that certification, especially being that it’s something you can take with you if you leave. "
publichealth,"Would that be true even with previous experience in public health in the USA ? "
publichealth,"If you don't mind me asking, how did you get started with this? I think I'd like to stay in academia but looking at job postings it seems that there are more opportunities for MS/PhDs than MPH levels, except for more administrative type work like research coordinator/project manager."

publichealth,"I know this is late but how do you like your job? How did you get into your field? "
publichealth,"This is my first job after I completed my MPH degree. My only experience with data analysis came from the work I did during my practicum and the data analysis projects I had during my biostatistics classes. I learned to use R and performed analysis on a public health dataset for a research project during my practicum and I leveraged that experience for my current position. My advice is to learn a statistical programming language, and be comfortable with it. It's better to know one programming language well, than to know a little bit of multiple ones. What you can do is learn a programming language while practicing with public datasets and create a portfolio of your analysis. Also, list any analysis you've done projects at school as your data analysis experience. "
publichealth,"What discipline your MPH is in is going to have a big impact on the advice you get... What's your MPH in?

And my advice is to work hard, pay attention to your professor's research, and use Microsoft OneNote to keep everything organized. "

publichealth,"Oh wow this sounds amazing. This made me think of the national council to end homelessness, which does a conference too. "
publichealth,I lol'd.
publichealth,"I think there are so many factors to take into consideration.  For instance, what other priorities do you have?  For me, it's my full-time job and my two boys.  I have learned to balance my commitment and responsibilities but I can tell you it's been challenging at times to fully focus on school.  It also depends on the classes you are taking each semester/quarter.  Some are more challenging than others and some are going to possibly bore you.  My recommendation is to treat your classes just as you would a traditional brick-and-mortar class setting.  I have a set schedule daily and commit an allotted amount of time to study and complete assignments.  I retreat to my room to study and my family knows to leave me alone to focus on class.  

As for what you can do with an MPH is endless.  I've met health educators, epidemiologists, statisticians, quality management specialists, and several non-profit leaders who all have a MPH.  I currently work for a health plan focusing on health care quality measures.  I'll probably continue this after I graduate next spring.  I hope this helps and I wish you luck  "
publichealth,"I would UCLA. I had the choice between UAB and Tulane and chose UAB. Granted my undergrad wa there too. But cost wise it was also a better choice in the end. "
publichealth,nice. all those profits for big tobacco are going a long way toward improving our society.
publichealth," I am a health educator for my county’s health department. I work in cancer prevention"
publichealth,"It sounds like you are pretty well set for environmental health. If you want to go into EPI you need more statistics, and if you want to go towards industrial hygiene you will need more chemistry, toxicology wouldn't hurt. 

For most places I don't think a master's degree is really necessary, it could be a waste of money.

I'm an EHS, I have a BS in environmental science and I'm an REHS with NEHA, I highly suggest the water and wastewater field. "
publichealth,"Probably, I intended my question to be about how to get into the field of epidemiology if I'm currently not working in it. For example, based on what I've found, engineering companies prefer to hire those with engineering degrees that picked up skills on the way rather than applicants that have the skills but outside of engineering. 

Basically, can I work in spatial epidemiology or will employers just pick someone with an epidemiology degree that took a GIS class or two instead? "
publichealth,"Yes.  Do it.  You will have no regrets.  I'm currently working on my MPH and I can tell you I was hired for my current position working for a health plan because of it.  I've been approached with several opportunities to advance my career because my director knows I'll be graduating next spring and she's eager to place me in a leadership role.  I've opted to wait until I graduate because I have school and family to juggle.  I don't want a new role to take my focus away from school.  So yes, I would say that it will definitely open up many possibilities for you.  As for your interests, there are so many opportunities that encompass all of your interests.  For instance, most health plans have departments dedicated to education services and you'd definitely work toward addressing all the components you mention.  I'm in California and the state contracts commercial health plans to administer their Medicaid, so we definitely are out in the communities trying to make an impact.  "
publichealth,Medicaid costs $1?
publichealth,"I did apply with the dual degree in mind, but you can pick up the dual degree if you want after you start!"
publichealth,"I wouldn't call any public health field except biostats ""STEM""....But, I am personally so much less interested in attending Columbia.

publichealth,Thanks! The programs are all affordable for me luckily. My guess is the best alumni base is the UA but I’ll have to do some research.
publichealth,"I’m doing a B.S. in Public Health, meaning we do a fair amount of science. (bio, chem, phys, a+p, biostat, etc.). I’ll also be taking courses in microbio, infectious disease ecology, etc. Am I on the right path if my end goal is a PhD?"
publichealth,"I moved from across the country for my graduate program as well. Being in a committee has really helped me meet others in my cohort as well as faculty! And like the original comment said, I get to go to awesome lunches and stuff because of it! I feel respected by faculty too which is honestly a good feeling when we're working so hard."

publichealth,"I graduated in May with a B.S. in Public Health with a concentration in Health Education and minors in Spanish and Statistics.

I am currently serving as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Guatemala as a Healthy Schools Coordinator. In this position I am supporting my municipality (think county-level in the U.S.) in implementing the national Healthy Schools strategy that is a bi-ministerial agreement between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health. 

I work with primary school teachers and directors (principals) to improve their teaching and knowledge about health topics, strengthen parent's groups, and also work with student health promoters. There are also volunteers who work on infrastructure projects like new bathrooms, school kitchen improvements, and water projects to get water to the schools. I also work with the municipal level Health Schools commission as well as the food security commission. "
publichealth,"I did! I don’t know a ton about the selection process, but will answer any questions as best I can!"
publichealth,"I'm not sure how to answer the skills question. I would say I'm very interested in Health/Nutrition/Medicine in general. I'm pretty well-versed in the sciences/human body since I took pre-med classes. My current job is also dealing with the public in the funeral industry. So I believe I have very good communication skills with dealing with many different groups/cultures of people during a very vulnerable state. "
publichealth,Choose another masters
publichealth,"1. Obligatory do what makes you happy in public health and take the time to find out what that means. It's okay to like epi and it's also okay not to like it as long as you recognize where it's useful. 

2. Honestly I think MHAs and individuals able to do Bioinformatics are going to be in demand in the coming years. Biostats is always necessary, epi as well.  

3. Learn SAS. I wish someone had told me this in undergrad. Or R or STATA, but if you want to do Epi, SAS is superior. 

4. Good luck, hope you get a summer position! "
publichealth,"If you want to practice law, a JD is non negotiable. The LLM degree functions sort of like a postdoc or research year for recent JD graduates (or for lawyers from non-Western countries looking to work in the US). You can't do it without prior training in law. 

If you're not sold on being an  ""attorney"" or on 4 years of school and you're interested in public health policy, you should also look into joint MPP/MPH degrees as well."
publichealth,"That's true. The bigger non-profit organizations I want to work with will likely not pay for the practicum. Which might be difficult financially, but I know our school has some funding opportunities for students going on practicums that are unpaid. It sort of sucks how thats the reality though, the good placements are usually unpaid :( Makes it sort of inaccessible for a lot of motivated/passionate students."
publichealth,I used Indeed and Tom Manatos mainly. I would check out GWU and DC gov't jobs database as well. (Don't bother with USA Jobs d/t hiring freeze.) Emory also has a national jobs board for public health.
publichealth,"Do you *have* to do an internship to graduate or is just recommended? If the latter, then I would consider your job to be checking that box since it's relevant work experience and especially since you can reasonably continue working there after graduation. If the former, start talking to your school asap to figure out how you can stay at the job and get internship credit for it. "
publichealth,"That’s great advice thank you! I actually didn’t mean the internship was a bad thing in my opinion, I am actually glad it’s a requirement because of the reasons you stated. Sorry if I worded it oddly! 

I will also definitely give USF a look. Is that on the SOPHAS application system? 

Thanks a lot for the help! I’m very excited to pursue this degree"
publichealth,"Thank you! No, I do not want to work with patients directly. The other paths you mentioned do interest me, though."
publichealth,"Hahah!  Nope, lounge and lab is still there.  Lounge is probably the same.  Some days it's really clean, others not so much.  I'm in there to store my food and sometimes heat stuff up, then I'm right back out.  I actually did the same thing trying to find my first stats lab last year!  Currently on the third floor doing some research right now- not much else to do on a rainy day.  Hope all has been well since graduation."
publichealth,"Within my department there aren't many (Nutrition department, not very entrenched in opiod abuse) but within the public health school it seems to be all any presentation or seminar is about. There's a student research group just for opioid abuse. I'm not involved myself, but [this symposium write-up](http://sph.unc.edu/sph-news/symposium-gathers-research-teams-to-address-opioid-addiction-overdose/) or [this list of people across disciplines working on the problem at the school](https://uncnews.unc.edu/2017/10/27/unc-experts-available-discuss-opioid-epidemic-diverse-impacts/) might be of interest?"
publichealth,AFAIK they vary depending on the organization/institution...
publichealth,"I appreciate the response! looks like there are some great continuing ed options through the AIHA that would certainly be cheaper than going back to school.  I think I would have a good shot of convincing my job to help out with some of the costs as well, as it would be beneficial for them to have someone with that knowledge on site.  Cheers! "
publichealth,"Thanks for the response!  I definitely have noticed that the people in the field that I have connected with come from a wide variety of backgrounds, only a few went to school for IH.  And coming from an environmental background, I do have general knowledge of learning about sampling equipment on the go, but that's good to know that looking through a manual/video can prepare me well.  I will definitely look into that!  

Good to know that you were able to get the CEU's without going to school for it--another poster recommended looking at the AIHA for courses and I will certainly talk to my employer about taking some of those.    

Overall, it's a relief to get some feedback that points towards not getting a second master's, as I was definitely worried about taking on that additional debt.  Thanks again for the advice!  

"
publichealth," No don’t delete it! It’s nice to know there’s someone in the same place! "
publichealth,"Hi! I’m just finishing up my MPH specializing in Global Health and Infection Control at the University of South Florida. It’s fully online aside from the internship. I had gotten in to UofA for an MPH in Epi and struggled a bit with which to choose. I ultimately chose USF because it had great reviews, the curriculum was more interesting to me, and they also provided a tuition waiver for full-time distance learning students, which almost halved the cost of the program. 

I’m glad I picked USF. Aside from the one bad apple of a prof that I got stuck with for a semester, the faculty are wonderful and genuinely care about their students; I was afraid I’d be doing this alone as a distance learner but never felt that way at all. My only issue was that I struggled to find an internship site that would accept a student who attends a school on the other side of the country, but I was still able to figure it out. When I start working full time and begin to network more, I plan to help foster relationships with local sites on behalf of future students who may enroll from my area so they don’t have to struggle like I did. 

Take a look at USF and check out the MPH curriculum and concentrations and see how you feel about it. Remember, this is what you’ll be doing for the couple of years. Regardless of how challenging it can be you’ll want to enjoy it on some level. Also, don’t let an internship requirement dissuade you. The experience you’ll get from an internship will look great on a resume/CV. It’s daunting now, I know, but it’s so worth it. I’m glad I had that opportunity. Feel free to message me if you have any questions or if there’s anything I can help with."

publichealth,"I just did 35,000 /52 weeks/40 hours and got 16.82, I guess it would be 16.83 rounded up."
publichealth,"I got my BSPH and MPH in nutrition and everyone used SAS or STATA. My nutrition epi professors made us learn STATA because it was easier (and most of us were not going to use it in the future), but everyone who worked in a SAS-based research group had to learn SAS.

So I would say start with SAS because it's harder and better, but also consider getting at least familiar STATA if you have time to do so before graduating because having both on your CV is always good when reaching out to potential PIs who could use either."
publichealth,"Thanks "
publichealth,"[This page from CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/ophss/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section11.html) gives plain language definitions of epidemic and related terms and concepts.

&gt;**Epidemic** refers to an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area. 

So for obesity, we need to start with the ""number of cases of a disease... normally expected.""  Up to around 30 years ago, obesity was a rare medical condition.  Using the terms from the above link, it had a low **endemic** level.  Then something happened:

http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2013/04/obesity_in_america_cdc_releases_gif_of_epidemic_over_time.html

As you can see, between 1985 and 2010, obesity levels went up in every state, above the long-term **endemic** rate.  That rise marked the beginning of the current obesity epidemic.

You may get questions about whether obesity is actually a disease.  It isn't spread from person to person via a virus or bacteria like the flu or strep throat.  Remind them that cancer is considered a disease even though it also isn't spread from person to person.  Obesity has very serious health consequences to people who suffer from it, and so it can be considered a disease.  Opioid overdose is another example of an epidemic that is related to people's behavior and not the spread of germs that cause disease."

publichealth,"Usually the Reddit rule is pick the cheapest CEPH accredited one. That's tough here if you don't get the assistantship. 

I will say, it always helps to challenge yourself and step out of your comfort zone. When I started looking at PhD programs, my professors from my MPH program told me that each university you go to will have a different philosophy or approach to public health. It's important to learn from the people that make up that program and use it to better shape your own view of public health. Often, working with different programs or schools will give you a more comprehensive view of the public health landscape. 

Good luck on your decision! "
publichealth,Did you have to take a special course/certificate for this? or was it all on the job training?
publichealth,"I'm in DC as well. If you're at all interested in research or programmatic stuff, titles like research assistant, program assistant, project coordinator, etc. would be good targets. Depending on the company, associate could also be a title at your level, but it's obviously higher in places that have lawyers. "
publichealth,"Health educator, chronic disease prevention."
publichealth,"Good news: for those who don't get EndNote for free, Mendeley is free, and works beautifully."
publichealth,"I've been looking for those titles but they seem few and far in between also most of the ones I come across have asked for an MPH or some certificate I've not even heard of or flat out do not qualify for. Do you search anywhere in particular for DC? "
publichealth,"We found that they didn't  change behaviour that much and individuals enjoyed the novelty at first, but didn't change their dosage in the end even if it came back positive for fentanyl. It is still considered a  good engagement tool though.

It IS being used by buyers and sellers to verify product claims of 'no fentanyl' where some people pay a premium to get a product unadulterated.

They're cheap so may still prove a useful tool in some circumstances - but they only provide a binary 'yes/no' answer to the presence of fentanyl, they do not provide information on amount of fentanyl present in a sample and the stripsare very sensitive so they can produce a positive result with a negligible, or insignificant amount t of fentanyl (even acknowledging its potency). 

Other forms of drug testing provide more substantial information (percent composition of substances, analogues, etc) but they'reu h more expensive and less portable. "
publichealth,Build academic connections that you can use as references. I did an exec program and messed up big time on this one. Very little contact with professors but I could have made more happen.
publichealth,This is an excellent analysis. Ouch.
publichealth,"I'm bumping. I'm finishing my MPH now online (University of New England). I've loved it, but also kinda craving in person work again. But then, I've got to travel over the world and move several times while continuously completing my program, so that's pretty darn nice :)"
publichealth,"When you have people in public health research/policy/practice who have an MD, part of what they bring to the table aside from your average MPH is the clinical practice background. If you graduate from medicine and don't practice as a doctor, you don't have this clinical experience to bring to the table, so there's not much added value in having the MD in the first place. 

Why not graduate, practice medicine for a few years, and then decide if you need to add further study or credentials in order to have a rewarding career?

Remember that you don't need to complete the whole picture of what your future career will look like by the age of 30. It evolves over time, with experience. The role models you're thinking of who work at the WHO are late-career professionals, not recent MD/MPH graduates. 

It would be worthwhile to look into internships at the WHO. I had a temporary contract position with one of the regional offices, and to actually be there and see how things are done from the inside is very eye opening and can help shape your decision making process. "
publichealth,"Yeah this applies to Columbia for sure but not for other top-ranked programs. Columbia is super generous with need-based scholarships but there is essentially no merit-based aid. "
publichealth,"And when I say tuition waivers I don't mean FULL waivers, just a portion of your tuition"
publichealth,"Just wondering since I'm also considering Berkeley for an MPH in epi/biostatistics, but where did you hear that their career services isn't helpful and that they're shrinking budget wise? I went to the admitted student day and they made it sound like they do a pretty good job finding you employment and internships. Just trying to gather more info before I make a decision."
publichealth,"Sure, I've an MPH in Biostatistics and I work as a data analyst for a university affiliated research group.  I also do some consulting work on the side for whatever comes through the grapevine, but those are usually small projects that are in my wheelhouse so to speak.     "
publichealth,"Yeah, those populations would also be a big issue if I wasn’t gay. They’re not happy about that but they’ve learned to tolerate it. Abortion would absolutely draw the line, however."
publichealth,"Is this a general question on what you want to do with your life? Or is this specific to your academic goals?  

Some things I would start considering are your financial goals, where you want to live on a long term etc.  When you look at your interests, put some context around them and plan a 10-15 year track. You may not follow this plan ever, but it will allow you to exclude some options."

publichealth,"Hey, I did my MPH at UCLA in epi &amp; am doing my PhD at Cal. Feel free to shoot me a DM, just because I don’t wanna air all my bizniz out in the open. :)"
publichealth,"I'm worried about the exact same thing, which is why I'm getting my associates in nursing, then my bachelor's in whatever, then my mph. 

Both of my parents were (are still registered) nurses, my mom becoming an epidemiologist and my dad branching off into health informatics. The knowledge they gained from the clinical environment is invaluable. I've seen it myself.

You probably don't need one though. I'm getting my nursing license because it worked so well with my parents. They branched off into other things with just an associate's in nursing.

Edit: there are tons of fast track bs to bsn programs out there that should only take a year, by the way. They're intense, so I don't think they advise you to work while talking those courses."
publichealth,"Was the same for me. I let my certificate lapse after I got my first job. "
publichealth,What do you do on a daily basis? Global health and maternal and child health are focus areas I have considered for my possibly getting my MPH
publichealth,"Also, hi! Go Bruins! FSPH for life lol. "
publichealth,"Yeah! The school of public health has a few strong external specialty funders, and I think I remember your program being one of them. (Mine was disaster health!)

I worked to manage a community based substance abuse and mental health org that did prevention and treatment, up till a few months ago. Now I do consultation and data management for nonprofits worldwide. (Better decisions through data!)

I lived in Palms while I was there. It’s about a 10 minute drive to campus, (or 25-30 minute bike ride) and you can usually get apartments there for cheaper than campus housing. There are lots of UCLA students living in the palms area, so it’s a pretty friendly community. If you can afford/don’t mind paying more than definitely live in Westwood near campus. Traffic is pretty awful in the area, so I’d try to live somewhere you won’t have to take a highway to get to campus. 

"
publichealth,"Wow, that’s amazing (the work you’re doing)! I hadn’t known about positions such as yours, I kinda figure that’s what social workers did. "
publichealth,"Yes. Conflicts of interest are disclosed (should be) at the end of studies. IRBs determine if the conflict is excessive, and the peer review process can generally weed out the rest. That's not to say that bias and paid-for propaganda studies don't happen, it's just that a greater number of people in positions of power would have to be ""in on it"" and incentivised. But that's not my field of expertise."
publichealth,"Yes.  Lot of my fellow students at Johns Hopkins MPH program are going to pharmaceutical industry.  You can get market access and account management jobs in that sector.  "
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"&gt; Is there a role for people like me with a hard science background, strong spatial analysis/stats experience, lots of experience with R, Python, and GIS software?

Absolutely!

You might not even need another degree (depending on skills and experience) to get a great job in analysis."
publichealth,"Hey!  I ended up choosing Columbia, but for reasons that are basically completely unrelated to the actual quality of the schools (extremely overbearing parent, long story...) Anyways, I went to both of the admitted students days and felt like both schools would be a good fit.  I ended up liking NYU more because I genuinely felt like they were invested in your success.  I really really loved the emphasis they placed on student-faculty interaction.  The professors there seemed to want to engage with the students and develop one-on-one relationships, which was something I felt like was sorely lacking at Columbia.

All in all, if everything was left in my hands, I would have chosen NYU.  Feel free to message me if you have any more questions!"
publichealth,"BRFSS covers some nutrition related questions, have you tried looking at that dataset? How are you measuring stress level? It might be hard to find a dataset that measures nutrition and stress in a way that allows you to link the two instead of looking at overall % for each variable. I can't think of a dataset that identifies college students specifically. How much data do you need? Are you looking for a national survey or could it be one state? 

Your research question sounds like one that would need to be done with actual data collection, not just secondary analysis. I think what you're trying to get at is that students become stressed in college (to varrying degrees) which is associated with poorer nutrition. But to answer that question you'd need to be able to track those students over time and look at the correlation between increased stress level and poor nutrition. That type of data isn't publicly available to my knowledge. "
publichealth,MPVM? You could probably find a job but you would be competing with people with a DVM or DVM and a MPVM. You’re most likely better off getting the MPH since you already have the vet tech qualification (I presume). I’m in a similar boat to you where I want to do some veterinary public health but no longer have the desire for vet school; I went the PhD route which can open doors if you are more geared towards the research side of things.
publichealth,"I found doing the citations by hand in undergrad therapeutic and fun, but will definitely look into a citation manager. I've heard good things about mendeley, zotero, and endnote."

I have acquaintances in this field who were asked to prepare a 5 minute presentation for their interview as well, but I've never heard of anyone having an impromptu one.  Maybe they want to see if you know where to pull health data and where things on their website are located?"
publichealth,"Hopefully someone chimes in here with more experience... As far as pregnancy, a lot of low income mothers are covered under Medicaid, not Medicare. Medicare will cover pregnancies for moms with disabilities, but from what I understand it's uncommon conparitively. Medicaid and CHIP cover your low income child populations, but in cases of disability kids can be covered by Medicare. There's probably more of an opportunity for you to learn about aging women's health working with Medicare than there will be on the child/maternal side of your research. Still probably a good learning opportunity since understanding healthcare funding is a puzzle. "
publichealth,"Several pieces of advice (got my MPH in Epi):

* If you have the opportunity to do so, try to learn as many data analysis software packages as you can. This is critical, as different jobs require different stats packages. It may be helpful to research the job market around where you plan on living after you complete your MPH. Read position descriptions and see what specific software experience they are looking for. If your program (or university for that matter) does not offer a course in one you identify as a recurring requirement, ask your faculty how you can get experience with it.
* Get involved and attend as many special presentations as you can. Not only do they provide you with interesting information (and occasionally free food), they also could turn into fantastic networking opportunities.
* Hang out with your cohort outside of class and have fun.
* Follow the news &amp; current events closely, especially health-related news. The background knowledge you pick up from doing so could help you in class discussions.

That all said, best of luck and enjoy!"
publichealth,Dual
publichealth,What program do you use for your analysis? I'd love to get a job as a data analyst and I'm most comfortable with SAS over anything else. I know SAS can be pretty expensive but is also preferred for federal work. Not sure if local health departments invest in it.
publichealth,"That’s what I figured. I would prefer to have the background knowledge, and I really wish I had known about IH my freshman year. Thanks for the advice!"
publichealth,"How have I neverheard of RTI international?  Looked em up, now I want to work for them."
publichealth,"UCLA MPH Alum here! (2014). I loved the program, but I had a different concentration than you’re going for—I did Community Health. So can really only speak for my friends’ experiences vs the program itself. 

Industrial hygiene is part of the Environmental Health Sciences (EHS) department. We are required to take some classes out of our department, and the 2 EHS classes I ended up taking we’re really good, rigorous, and the professors were incredibly knowledgeable. My friends that did EHS are all now happily employed or continuing their education and are in labs. The school is well connected to various county departments of health, as well as some of the major companies in the area. 

Tuition is $20k a year, so $40k total for the two years. There are lots of TA and other opportunities open to reduce your total cost. If you aren’t a CA resident, it’s an extra $10k a year. You can avoid that by moving to CA and working for a bit before starting the program. 

Bonus, they had just started redoing the entire building when I was leaving—they should be done by now, so you would get a shiny new building. 

Hope this helps! Ask me anything else that you may want to know about the program. "
publichealth,"I would also make sure your program actually runs/suggest SAS. Our University has switched to R which runs on any device. However, we also run ESRI GIS which does not.

Personally, I hate windows. I run a partition on my Mac and use the Cloud to keep files I need on both. A little extra work, but keeps me away from Windows."
publichealth,"I'm in an online MPH program right now and I'd offer a few things that I think are crucial:

* If your school provides you with a faculty member as an advisor, take advantage of that. Build a relationship with that person. Talk to them about your long-term goals so they can help you work backwards from those goals to a logical set of elective choices.
* If you're part of a fixed cohort going through the program at the same time, great. Build online relationships with your fellow students. Lean on them and let them lean on you. Share ideas, feedback, whatever makes sense. Socialize online. Set up a Slack workspace and invite your fellow students to it. Set up a Dropbox folder and share research papers, curriculum materials, and the like. This is tougher if you're in a school that doesn't use the cohort system, but it can be done.
* If you have the option to do a thesis or dissertation as part of your program, strongly consider it, as it will open more doors to you down the road.
* If you have the opportunity to spend time on your school's campus, even if only rarely, take it. Ultimately there's no substitute for in-person, face-to-face relationships."
publichealth,"I’m so glad my experience can help guide you! And I mention the internship thing because I found it to be something I was pretty anxious about myself, even right up to the day I started it.

I like the MPH path but I also like the other two and they aren't very transferable as far as degrees go. I have a while to choose since I want to get my loans down to reasonable amounts before even moving on to grad school. Thanks for the words of wisdom though, very helpful! "
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"Short answer: No.

Long answer: Depends on what you want to do in infectious disease. Do you want to provide clinical care? Do you want to conduct research? Do you want to aid in surveillance and response?

If you want to help treat, in addition to other tasks, then you'll need a clinical degree. Either an MD, or nursing degree.

If you want to conduct infectious disease research, again, you can split this up into more basic science research, and population health research. Here, you'll need at least a bachelor's degree in biology, etc. If you want to lead projects, design studies, etc., you'll need a PhD. If you just want to work in the field, a bachelor's will likely be sufficient (though you'll be restricted to conducting bench work, or generally working for someone)

If you want to do population infectious disease research, then you'll at least need a Master's degree in epidemiology, biostatistics, or environmental health. You can get by with a bachelor's degree, but will be limited in advancement. Again, if you want to lead projects, set up studies, then you'll likely need a PhD or DrPH.

As a general (personal) suggestion, I would say you might want to consider an undergraduate degree in biology or a similar hard science field, with courses in statistics, epidemiology, etc. if possible. From there, you can head down the clinical route, the lab route, or the public health route."

publichealth,"Yeah, I move out of here in a year and change so hopefully I'll be able to get my experience when I move. I want to get an MPH because public health as a whole is very interesting to me but at the same time I'm not sure what in. It really sucks to have it be so difficult to even get experience before going into a degree program. "
publichealth,"I agree with most of what Statistics said. However, I'll add in that even if you have the ""technical skills"" (which is a very broad descriptor, do the schools offer different skillsets like SAS vs. R vs. SPSS? Another thing to look into) you may not know how the heck to use these in practice or in the real world.

Example - I know how to code in SAS based on being taught during my graduate courses however I coded in R every single day for my internship so I have a more intimate knowledge of that and how to handle certain problems with that whereas I would probably be lost trying to do some of my work in SAS."
publichealth,"I applied (and was accepted) to both Yale and BU. I'm in my second semester at BUSPH right now, in the CAPDIE (Community Assessment, Program Design, Implementation, and Evaluation) concentration! I absolutely LOVE the program here. The structure of the program fit well with what I was personally looking for (first semester you are placed in a cohort and everyone takes the same four intense classes, second semester and beyond you take courses that fit your interests/your concentration). The professors and staff are absolutely wonderful - kind, helpful, and truly want the best for all of their students. Networking is HUGE at BUSPH and there are so many amazing opportunities. I am already working as a Fellow at the MA Department of Public Health! 

I would highly recommend visiting or attending accepted students day if you haven't already. PM me with any questions or if you're in Boston and want to meet up and find out more let me know! "
publichealth,"Would it be a Pandemic yet? Atleast with regards to the US. I feel like thats the next epidemiological escalation term. If not, how prevelant would be required for such a term to be used?"
publichealth,"My program focus —&gt; To be honest, I’m not sure. 
Environmental health is something that’s been striking a cord with me lately (especially the Flint water crisis and debates about water as a right). I’m also interested in mental health so I’ve thought about volunteering at the psychiatric department in my local hospital. Access to health and it’s quality is also something I find interesting. "
publichealth,How do I go about applying for this? This interests me because I am considering PA school.
publichealth,I hadn't thought of that as a possibility. Thank you! That would be a great entrée into the field.
publichealth,"No. It still affects a very small percentage of the total US population, it is mostly contained within certain sub-populations (primarily lower income, white, and rural), and it does not extend to other countries.

It's obviously subjective, but typically for the pandemic moniker you need a higher percentage affected, you need it to affect many ethnic/cultural groups, and you need all of the above to be a problem not just in certain geographic areas/pockets of 1 country."
publichealth,"I worked as a RN at a children’s hospital for two years before getting my MPH in maternal and child health. Since graduating, I’ve worked as a home visiting nurse and as a Public health nurse at my local health department. I’ve found that having a clinical background has definitely opened a lot of doors for me in public health. 

Since you already have a Masters, I’m not sure if getting an MPH would be worth more debt. I suggest looking at jobs at your state/local health departments and academic medical centers — they often need NPs/RNs as medical specialists, Public health nurses, research nurses, and care coordinators. This will help get your foot in the door in the public health field. Some states offer certifications in public health for nurses. You can also take classes in data analysis/epidemiology and stats programs such as R, STATA, SPSS which will help boost your resume. 

"
publichealth,"I think the title to this article is suggestive. Often enough industries fund research to prove or disprove a hypothesis, but it does not necessarily mean that these studies are biased."

publichealth,I am getting my MPH part time at the moment and working full time as an investigator for the FDA. Public health has many different paths and all are awesome!
publichealth,"Hiya.

The /r/publichealth community is aimed at professionals with an interest in public health, global health, and medicine. Recruiting participants here would likely provide very skewed data.

Surveys should be posted in **/r/samplesize** which is a subreddit dedicated to finding survey participants; please read their rules before posting there."
publichealth,"I did have one research internship with one of the governmental organizations here in Texas. It was epidemiology-related. 

I was also an active member and heavily involved several organizations and volunteered. I also worked in the Deans Office for 2.5 years. I made As in almost all of my Public Health classes so I’m also well-versed in things such as program development, underserved populations, epidemiology, and statistics. 

Lmao sorry if I sound like I’m trying to sell myself to you. I’m just really hoping to narrow down my job searches. 

Anyways..thank you! I’m trying to stay positive, but it’s hard when you’re not even getting callbacks lol"
publichealth,"I did environmental health (well, industrial hygiene, which was a subfocus of environmental/occupational health in my program) and in my job as an industrial hygienist, I do get a lot of field work and interacting with people. 

My recommendation would be to talk to people working in the fields you're interested in before pulling the trigger on applications. Talk to the faculty at the schools you're looking at. Get a feel for the programs and the courses before committing yourself to a degree you're not sure what to do with."
publichealth,"Industrial hygienist here. I highly recommend that you take the prerequisite physics, chemistry and physiology courses. They will go a long way in helping you grasp concepts, finish assigments, and understand the basics of the profession. "
publichealth,"Usually, yes. Especially in the current situation, with a tightened budget. A lot of my classmates did work-study at the CDC that transitioned to contractor or fellowship positions. There is no strict requirement (that I know of) to move from these positions to an FTE. One friend moved to FTE status from ORISE after a year post-graduation, but he did his work-study and his practicum (and I *think* thesis) with that group. A few others, including my fiancee, are ORISE fellows in their second year. Perhaps if we were under a different administration, they might have moved to FTE status sooner, but some branches or teams would like their fellows to stick around for 3-4 years before moving up. Some drag their feet and their fellows leave after a few years to pursue other roles.

I don't think the CDC necessarily requires ***more*** experience, but it might require specialized experience. It can be more difficult to get in if you're competing against internal candidates or contractors, etc. who have been working within the federal system, performing more specialized tasks. For example, you might find a position that either requires or prefers a candidate with experience working with influenza surveillance data from states and territories. While you may have experience contributing to said data, and might have even analyzed data from the overall data set, you might be going up against candidates who have worked on creating the surveys, or pooling and cleaning the data you yourself sent to the system.

However, one way to get around this is to make connections within certain branches you are interested in joining. As FTEs become available, they might be able to leverage their connections to ensure you make it into the pool of candidates. You can do this through daily work at your department of health, or at conferences, etc."
publichealth,"I was hoping to make around 70k/year or enough money to be able to go on vacations an not have to worry about my savings.

But you idea seems to make sense, on how it doesn't matter as much for what degree you have. "
publichealth,"That's fair, Canadian tuition is much less compared to our neighbours to the south. I actually ended up choosing the program that was cheaper also. Was also given a small scholarship and hoping to land more once I am in the program.

I am so sorry that happened to you though, and wish you the best moving forward. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat."

There is an epidemic of obesity starting about 1980 in both developed and undeveloped countries definitely associated with multiple etiologies. About 670 million people worldwide are obese. The incidence of obesity has increased in all age groups, including children. Obesity causes numerous diseases and the interaction between genetic, metabolic, social, cultural and environmental factors are possible cofactors for the development of obesity. Evidence emerging over the last 20 years supports the hypothesis that viral infections may be associated with obesity in animals and humans. The most widely studied infectious agent possibly linked to obesity is adenovirus 36 (Adv36). Adv36 causes obesity in animals. In humans, Adv36 associates with obesity both in adults and children and the prevalence of Adv36 increases in relation to the body mass index. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the viral E4orf1 protein (early region 4 open reading frame 1, Adv) mediates the Adv36 effect including its adipogenic potential. The Adv36 infection should therefore be considered as a possible risk factor for obesity and could be a potential new therapeutic target in addition to an original way to understand the worldwide rise of the epidemic of obesity. Here, the data indicating a possible link between viral infection and obesity with a particular emphasis to the Adv36 will be reviewed."

publichealth,"This.  Made me remember that UCLA did this.  I think it's FSPH-wide.  I didn't take the opportunity as an incoming student, but it was super cool meeting with soon to be students as an outgoing student."
publichealth,"This was absolutely not true for me. My undergrad GPA was 3.5 and I got significant merit scholarships. Admissions committees &amp; financial aid offices tend to take a more holistic view than just GPA and test scores. "
publichealth,"CHS tends to be the least well compensated of the bunch, I’m currently in the $70k-$80k annually bracket. I started out of school in the $60k-$70k bracket. 

Rent in LA is expensive...Palms (at least used to be) the cheapest area. You may want to consider cost of living in your decision making. If you’re ok with living further out, there is the LA metro rapid 720 line and the Culver City rapid 6 line that serves UCLA. I hear the 720/20 isn’t the most reliable of bus lines though. 

The community is great-I was in a dual program so I split time between north and south campus, but even with splitting time, you get close enough with your class that people can recognize you several years later based off your reddit username lol. Everyone takes what they do seriously, but I had tons of fun as well. We helped each other out in the program, and still help each other out post graduation. 

I continued working at the behavioral health agency that I was employed at before/during my program, so I can’t speak much to job search things, sorry!"
publichealth,"The departments are so different.  I've loved my department, HPM, and UCLA (FSPH) has given me so many opportunities to meet people and public health professionals.  Plus, the alumni network in the area is HUGE.  I'm sad to soon be leaving, that's for sure.  Although during my time here I've had the chance to TA classes, do research for professors, head up a student association body, and really interact with FSPH and other departments....but that's all really up to you.  My department places a lot of focus on professional development and they hold a lot of networking events and workshops, so I am not sure how EHS does it or how involved their faculty is in their students."

publichealth,"I’m going back to get my MBA now. Additional degrees really depend on your personal career goals. I think in most cases, the MPH should be the only degree most people need until they decide if a PhD or DrPH are important for their careers goals or not. For many people, further graduate education isn’t necessary."
publichealth,"needs to be per-capita, and a barely-started flu season isn't worth comparing"
publichealth,"Not a single mention of our cholesterol, saturated fat, bioaccumulated metals in fish and lead in drinking water? What about the fact that we eat plenty of calories but rarely satisfy RDA’s for key vitamins and nutrients.

Processed foods have become a huge issue since their conception and tend to remove beneficial aspects of foods. The more whole food and plant based a diet, the less we tend to see chronic diseases. 

Have you seen any research on heart disease and red meat consumption? What about diabetes and intramyocellular lipids? Why are diabetes rates so low in vegan populations compared to pescatarian, flexitarian, and omnivore diets?

Our increased consumption of chicken and eggs and dairy is one issue. Then our veggies consumed are generally French fries (potatoes) and pizza sauce (tomatoes). Our top consumed fruits are apples and then apple juice and orange juice.

We process fruits and vegetables and fry them in fat or dip them in sugar and fat and then eat them. Our bodies naturally crave calorie dense foods and now we eat so much of it that our bodies are reacting in pretty alarming ways.  "

publichealth,"Most well-paying public health positions require at least a master’s degree. That’s where you learn data analysis.

publichealth,"Try getting on LinkedIn and messaging current or former MPH students of NYU and Columbia. You can enroll in the one month trial for Premium LinkedIn if you aren't able to message outside of your network. For NYU, I would especially ask about internship placements (local government, policy think tanks, non-profits) and techinical skills (e.g., policy briefs, analysis of service utilization, SPSS, SAS, SQL) that were learned and hopefully somehow useful outside of the classroom.

I agree about debt concerns. You can try to find public salary information in NY of goverment workers. Either look them up by name or title of whatever MPH type jobs are available locally. The starting pay in my large county is not very high for MPHs as analysts, epidemiologists, and health promotion specialists. Other jobs elsewhere (private sector vs public sector) might pay higher, though."
publichealth,"No one will care where you got your MPH as long as the school has a sound reputation and your grades are good. Go for the lower cost. 

Saving 40k with scholarships means you're that much closer to paying down your debt, saving up for a home down payment, or whatever you want later in life. 
"
publichealth,"While I can’t comment on the school itself, if you interview in for a public health job in the US after you gain your MPH I can practically guarantee that your interviewer will not wonder about what was involved in completing it."
publichealth,"Hey there! I posted almost the same thing / title a couple of months ago. I am an American studying at the University of Glasgow but I was also accepted to LSHTM's MSc. Epidemiology program. LSHTM was my dream school for years and it really hurt when I had to let go. In the end though, I had to look past the prestige of the name and look at the reality.

Living in London was a much larger financial investment than the school tuition. I would have had to start working my 2nd month there to keep up. I decided that an MSc. in Biostatistics at the University of Glasgow was a better investment (because it was in biostatistics) and that I can actually afford to live here. My rent is half the price of what I estimated it would have been in London.

Do I regret it? Sometimes. I think the name would give me a leg up in PhD programs and networking but also keep in mind that most people, unless they are in public health, are not aware of LSHTM's prestige or the fact that it exists. When I was in the states, I worked in major city's health department and most people, save for my boss who publishes, had never heard of LSHTM. There are plenty of people at my current program that are super talented and could probably go on to top tier PhD programs (and some past alumni have). In the end, your own ability to succeed will be the biggest factor in PhD programs.

edit: The epi program also only taught in Stata and I was not about that life. I wanted to learn R and SAS with my curriculum. "
publichealth,"While there may be evidence to support these measures within a harm reduction framework, I really think this will be a tough sell to the public. "
publichealth,"I think family members of abusers will be supportive, they’ve seen that their loved ones aren’t going to stop and will take comfort in the knowledge that there’s a safe place for them.

I think that as long as the emphasis is on the fact that it’s a safe place with knowledgeable and helpful staff to show them how to start recovery, the public will be more accepting.

Calling it “designated places to shoot up” is a one way ticket to get people turned off by the idea.

Something more along the lines of “addiction recovery and support centers” may be helpful in generating approval."
publichealth,"While I agree that the having the families and other support networks have the potential to see this as something that will help their loved ones, I think some will still see it as placating the addition rather than treating it. And I think it will be hard to get support from the public to allow these places to exist within their communities, let alone provide the tax base necessary to fund these sorts of operations. 

Message framing is a must but I think changing the overall tone around addition in this county has a long way to go. That said, the opioid epidemic is impacting more and more people every day, either directly or indirectly, so maybe that attitude shift may happen sooner rather than later. "
publichealth,"With the drastic increase of opioid abuse, the number of people who know and/or love someone with an addiction is increasing. Hopefully media outlets will start to paint the use and recovery programs in a better light to encourage everyone else to get onboard."
publichealth,Thanks for the response! I saw your post just after posting this one and was hoping you would chime in haha. Would it be alright if I sent you a PM? It would be helpful to chat a little more in depth about this and I would appreciate your perspective!
publichealth,"Great background, but I don't agree about looking at state smoking bans. This will give you an idea of at least which states require clean indoor air ordinances and perhaps even some state specific laws on smoking in prisons. States with comprehensive clean indoor air ordinances will require prison systems to follow those laws. Enforceability is an issue everywhere, not just in prisons, and the research doesn't seem to be focussed on enforceability. 

Diving into a local level would definitely be annoying. State policy may be more lax than local ordinance, local ordinance may have existed before state policy, state may not have a law and then you have no idea what towns across the state do and don't have those laws, etc. etc. "
publichealth,"I’m sure there are people on here that could help, although we’d much rather see you doing research, cold emailing, etc. etc. You can do it if you’ve gotten this far! You can get away with a ton pulling the student card- you should know that, so get out there and hustle. What about old professors? Might want to check LinkedIn for alumni in the area too. There are a ton of public health schools in Boston also, you never know how those professors will react if someone reaches out to them, I’m sure those schools also hold events and grand rounds/seminars/talks on things you’re interested in.

Edit: Not trying to sound rude, you may be doing all these things already and just covering your bases. "
publichealth,I'm almost finished with my MPH at UF. I also majored in biology as an undergrad and have found the workload so much lighter during my master's. It helps that I'm really interested in the classes I've taken and studying often doesn't feel much like work to me.  I've definitely enjoyed my time and have had plenty of opportunity to pursue research-related work on top of my classes.
publichealth,"I would definitely recommend getting work experience before the MPH. You'll be in a much better position to find a job after you graduate, plus you'll learn more about yourself and what you want from the MPH when you do pursue it."
publichealth,Thats great! The work load for gard school is something I was a little afraid of but its good to hear that its a bit lighter! Have you had the time to do any internships?

She no longer works with them, but I think they'd be a great place to start for you! They're big on health equity and the like. I'm sure if you snoop around on their website you can find some way to contact them. Boston is a great city for Public health. Good luck!"
publichealth,"For our program we're required to do an internship during or last semester, so I'm starting that now. Prior to this I worked at least part-time while taking classes and would have had plenty of time to do an internship instead if I wanted."
publichealth,"You can do a lot, it depends on what interests you.  Environmental protection might not be super easy to get right now with the federal government.  You might have more luck in the nonprofit world if you want to stick with that.

I'm not sure what drew you to environmental protection, but you may also want to consider the ""safety"" fields, environmental health, occ health, industrial hygiene, and so on.  You're protecting people from the hazards of the workplace or the environment.  I'm in that line of work now and I like what I do, plus it's easier to find those jobs because they're always needed whereas there's a political component to environmental protection which comes and goes based on politics."
publichealth,"I don't know where you are, but people come from all over the country to do an internship at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. I just finished an internship there, and there were people from as far as Florida and Virginia. It is, however, unpaid. "
publichealth,"All fair and good points — especially like the suggestion of looking broadly at clean indoor air initiatives opposed to efforts specific to corrections. Didn’t mean to imply OP should wholly forgo state and local (OP shouldn’t); but sort of thinking that, on a presumably short timeline, comparing federal systems might be quickest, easiest, and *possibly* a more valid comparison. This is all said without having done any research into this question since joining the conversation, though... "

publichealth,"Track trends in socio-economic status groupings, whatever measure is used for the US. See if the increase in mortality rate is restricted to lower SES and if the lower SES group is growing. That is: the mortality rate could remain the same for high SES and lower SES, but if the lower SES is growing and higher SES is shrinking then the overall mortality will appear to increase. Same deal with insured/not insured."

I think also by applying to the postion close to the date when the listing was posted helps. Because I applied on the 2nd and got a response 9 days later. I also applied to other listings but it wasn't as close to when the original date the listing was posted and so far no responses. "
publichealth,"Generally very very collaborative "
publichealth,"I was in the same dilemma as you are in now.  I'm a graphic designer/artist by trade but have an MPH (and soon a DrPH).  The health and social change fields are in desperate need of creative people for visual design, data visualization, web design, and social marketing.  I started consulting in these areas two years ago and have had steady work.  Public health agencies, nonprofits, and healthcare businesses like having people that can understand their lingo and concepts while creatively interpreting it for targeted or general audiences.  Having a strong background in data and stats gives you an advantage in the data visualization realm (as others have said).  Start looking at scientific artists like Eliza Wolfson, who takes complex microbiology concepts and turns them into easy to understand illustrations  (https://t.co/1Qgr5ZoEWd).  Hope this helps! "
publichealth,"That's a tough one, I'm assuming you're speaking about administration in a health system or hospital. 

Think about the major divisions of a health system - Clinical Operations (Medical, Nursing, and Ancillary), Finance, Information Services, Human Resources, Practice Management / Physician Relations, Quality, Compliance, Risk, Legal, and Strategy. 

An RN license will allow you to advance in Nursing, Quality, and maybe Practice Management, Compliance, and Risk. The other verticals require specific degrees (e.g., Finance requires an MA, MBA, and/or CPA). Ancillary leadership will probably promote techs. 

There are some great accelerated (18 months) BSN programs that would be an option for you. However, you should look into PA programs as well. The other options are to get an MHA (or MBA with healthcare concentration). People will disagree, but IMHO the MHA/MBA carries more clout than an MPH (with management concentration). Taking the clinical route provides a more certain route to ""management"". However, it's going to take longer. The fastest route I've seen is getting an MHA, then landing an administrative fellowship. Most fellows I know obtain a management position after their fellowship program. "
publichealth,"I would suggest researching DSRIP projects across the country, as well as considering work for a Medicaid payer or state Medicaid regulator. With a clinical background, your perspective will be valuable. You may also want to look into doing population health management in primary care. "
publichealth,"More to your question—you can do this work with an MPH. Get a JD if you want to work on the details of contracting and policy,  like the actual crafting of the sections and clauses. You can guide it and draft it with an MPH or MHA. "
publichealth,"a lot of partnerships with different organizations, schools, clubs, etc. you might be in charge of a project or be more of a help role. introverted- maybe. creative- yes. you need to tailor the important health messaging to the appropriate population, keeping in mind ages, cultures, etc"
publichealth,"In general, health promotion is for the extroverted that like teaching and doing outreach on health issues. However, I do evaluation of programs and it's a little more manageable. You work with stakeholders to understand and measure their programs and such- a lot of mixed methods. However, I always recommend trying health promotion, even if you're introverted. I tend to be introverted and I found that with practice, I really enjoy teaching and leading programs, when it's in a managed setting. Also, if you're creative, you may want to look into health communication because there's a huge market in finding the best ways to reach people with positive health information. "
publichealth,"Hi there! Local HD admin here, for a pretty rural area. The majority of the jobs on the local level won’t require anything near a doctorate. Now a big city/state central office/similar is different, but even then it’s iffy. Aside from that, generally any hiring manager at my level is going to have the follow items rolling around in their heads if a PhD appears on the scene:
1. Why are they applying here? 
2. How long would they last?
3. Why aren’t they at (feds/uni)?
4. Whoo they are going to cost a lot
Etc.
"
publichealth,"Also, the hands on comment is pretty spot on. All the newly minted mphs I’ve brought on have had minimal soft skills, and those are crucial for public work. They’ve generally gotten the idea after a while, but it can be a drag in comparison to bringing on a person with lots of people experience"
publichealth,"This is really helpful, thanks! It sucks that we structure stuff in a way that this work is necessary, but it does sound like interesting work."
publichealth,"Hmm that definitely makes sense; does having both degrees help or should I just shut off local government jobs from my radar (assuming I just go with the PhD)? "
publichealth,"I don't know much about govt work, but the difference between MPH and PhD is research experience. MPH teaches you the basics and then in PhD you actually start to apply and do it on a whole other level (at least in my experience). When I started for looking at private sector or research jobs during my MPH, I realized my degree would let me be a research assistant, but a PhD would let me be a PI. "
publichealth,"I don't think you can be a Clinical Research Coordinator, knowing nothing about clinical research. Even if you bluffed your way into the job, that bluff wouldn't last long. It's one thing to have no practical experience in a job you learned but having no theoretical knowledge either?
There's quite a lot involved:

You should have an understanding of the relationship and correspondence between site coordinators and clinical trials, as this position could be overseeing a team of CRAs and maintaining IRB adherence. "
publichealth,"Is the CRA entry level? I applied for both, CRA and CRC. One of the requirements for CRA is being a CRC for at least one year, so I assumed for Medpace the CRC was the entry level position."
publichealth,Words have meanings or did your Masters program not teach you this?
publichealth,"Hey! Thanks for your advice-it definitely sucks starting at the bottom, but you’re probably right it will be worth sticking it out for now"
publichealth,"Seriously, everyone in public health policy needs to understand words mean specific things, and not being technically right means you’re wrong. The nuances of federal funding and federal agency function are very difficult to understand if you don’t live in DC and work in health policy. "
publichealth,"Oh fellows, you’re both so right! I’m just such a goof to think that the cdc might not do gun research due to a budget amendment that lets non-scientific elected officials make the call that a study with findings that show a negative effect stemming from gun ownership/usage, could be considered an attempt to make policy, opening the door for funding reductions. Why aren’t the scientists just jumping all over that? 
I mean, I am sure you two, if your boss or supervisor or funding source said ‘you are welcome to research issue A, but if your findings could be construed by my nebulous definition as policy setting, then there’s going to be trouble’, both of you would jump on it, right?

publichealth,"Hey OP. I'm a CRC for a private organization. If you enjoyed the consenting and other coordinating work itself, I'd highly recommend looking at research sites that are private (if your academic) or that are dedicated research centers. I've been a CRC for 7 years and all the sites I've been at have allowed me and my colleagues a lot of responsibility. In fact, the main complaint I hear is that we have too much responsibility. I have a lot of latitude and at my current site only the RAs do things like blood draws and data entry and vitals (unless you really want to do that stuff). It's very odd to only allow a nurse to consent. That's actually not very common unless it is oncology. "
publichealth,"I was in Miami's Health Promotion program through 2016. It wasn't until I transferred to a school with an accredited and well established PH program that I realized what Miami's was lacking. There are still many different avenues of options for yourself; it just depends on what your overall focus is on. I know there were a few members of the department that had connections with Medpace out of Cincinnati if you have any interest in clinical trials. That's what my current PH concentration is in within my major, so it is what I inevitably know the most about. However, there are always the options of year-long internships and abroad programs that could aid in ""beefing"" up your resume. "
publichealth,"I wouldn't say they're all useless, but maybe yours was (sorry)? Was it an accredited BSPH program? That's what I did and we had an entire course on all the major behavior change theories, took biostatistics and epi, and had to do four semesters of research just to graduate.

If you have a lot of free time at the moment, I'd look into volunteer opportunities that can bolster your skills/resume."
publichealth,"Yeah, it sucks to spend more money but an MPH is in many ways the entry level degree"
publichealth,"Hi. Sorry about the BSPH degree. I'm was right there too. My BS was in PH, and there are so few options (unfortunately no one tells you that going in). I recommend you look at the nearest, largest health system and try to land a job in patient support work (scheduling, navigating, etc). Find one that will offer tuition assistance. Work for a couple of years, get insurance, go back to school (on their dime), and either move up with that employer or move on. Otherwise, you'll continue to lose out on most PH opportunities to MPHs. "
publichealth,"You might have more luck looking at bigger city health departments, which have more positions to fill. Hamilton County, Cuyahoga County, and City of Columbus Health Departments might be good starts. I had a few colleagues that started in Environmental Health as food or water inspectors (not the most glamorous jobs but decent paying with benefits) and moved into other roles like epidemiology or emergency preparedness as positions opened. "

publichealth,Tulane has a combined degree program!
publichealth,"I agree with this advice. Also, look into hospitals. There are a large number of hospitals in Ohio, and many are expanding to add public health related roles in their organization. There are a number of childrens and adult hospitals that post job openings for positions that may relate to your schooling. "
publichealth,"It really depends. For OP, this seems to be the case since their undergrad experience appears to be limited. Many undergrad programs offer research opportunities and have organizations that help you get more involved. If you don't utilize these resources, then you're putting yourself in a position where grad school is your only choice if you want to stay in the public health field. Many students don't seek these opportunities, and many programs don't heavily advertise them. Grad school isn't a requirement, but for a lot of people it is the best option. "
publichealth,"Hey, thanks for sharing your story. I'm a first year MPH student right now, and [this thread](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/mph-fall-2018-applied-accepted-waitlisted-rejected.1274899/) helped me a lot in my chances search.

If you're applying this cycle, I would recommend applying to some other schools in addition 

OR

publichealth,"That’s what I’ve been doing so far. I’ve connected with some people who work at Health Departments on LinkedIn. Went to their work for a day and checked at some Health Departments. Just seems there are never job positions at HDs. Hospitals have no idea what a Public Health degree is. I work at one for one of my jobs and the other ones I’ve reached too don’t either. Shit. I don’t even know what it is anymore. Idk why there is a degree when we need like 5 certifications to even get a job. I was thinking of doing food safety or occupational safety but I don’t know the first thing about it. This stuff wasn’t even talked about it in school. I guess I just got a shit education at my school. Someone I spoke to on LinkedIn told me the people at my school don’t keep up to date on PH and what they did teach is out of date anyway. 

To be honest, I don’t have a “focus”. I feel so burnt out on this field to the point I don’t even care anymore, I just feel awful having a bachelor’s degree and not getting a job based on my degree. I don’t keep up to date on PH and I don’t feel like paying money to join all these clubs “I’m supposed” to join. "
publichealth,"Have you looked at environmental consulting or support groups (permitting, water testing, haz waste evaluations, etc)? 

My EOH MPH was much more heavily weighted on the occupational side, so I did a safety/industrial hygiene internship and I've been working full-time as an industrial hygienist for almost 3 years."
publichealth,"I got a BSPH and yeah, in my opinion, it is a worthless degree. Really the only thing it’s good for is getting you into an MPH program (although pretty much any Bachelors degree would do just fine at that too). 

If you want to work in this field, you’re probably going to need to get a Masters. Where I work, it’s required for even an entry level position. "
publichealth,"So if I don’t want to get a Masters, I’m pretty much screwed then? I don’t care about this field enough to sink more money into it to be completely honest. I quit caring about it about a year and half before I graduated but I didn’t want to change my major that late and I didn’t even know what I would change it to if I did, so I just finished it to get a degree. 

Then last Feb. I started caring somewhat again and worked my ass off to connect with people and get experience and it all seems to be worthless, now I’m back to not caring again but like anyone alive, I just want to make money now and live a normal life. No one in my family went to college and none of my friends did, so I was just sorta expecting as long as you go to college, you walk out with a 40k a year job at least and now I’m realizing that’s not the case and no one gives one fuck you have a bachelors. 

"
publichealth,"Man, I'm sorry. It sounds like you're pretty frustrated, understandably so. Many schools do a poor job of preparing students for the real world. For many fields, the bachelor's is the new high school diploma, and the master's is the new bachelor's. And to get a job even with a bachelor's, you often have to have prior internship/part-time/research experience from college. It's shitty that many first-generation college students are never told this. That being said, you are where you are, and at least you have your current position, which I believe you can parlay into a job with insurance. My advice:

- Do you have any research or internship experience from undergrad? It sounds like you might not, but if you do, those could help you with jobs at hospitals, health insurance companies, health systems, etc. You can also look at government agencies outside of health - human services (if it is a separate agency in your area) and housing are the first to come to mind. And look at non-government agencies and non-profit organizations. See if there are any health fairs or community centers that have events that can give you an idea of what sorts of these organizations are in your area. 

- And if you don't particularly care about working in public health,  just look for any jobs that require a bachelor's. Play down what field your degree is in, and play up the skills you have. Due to the whole ""bachelor's is the new HS diploma"" thing, a lot of entry-level jobs are poorly compensated and involve unexciting administrative work, so expect to put in 1-2 years at a job like that. Yes, it sucks, but that is what the job market looks like these days. But if you can demonstrate ""skills"" on your resume like being organized, detail-oriented, basic computer/MS Office-type stuff, reliable, etc., it shouldn't matter too much what your degree was in. That's how English majors get jobs. 

- Keep up the connections that you made on LinkedIn and through your school career center. Even if they didn't have jobs available when you first talked to them, you want them to think of you when a position does open up. 

- Wait at least a couple of years before getting an MPH, because that shit is often pretty expensive and time-consuming, and you'll want to be sure you want to continue in public health before you invest in it. "
publichealth,"Can you sit for any of the certifications like Certified Health Educator?

If you do an MPH- you don't have to end up in what most people think of as public health . 

You can be biostatistician in pharma, you can go into a hospital to do healthcare management or you can work as a data analyst in healthcare consulting . You can make your skills more broadly applicable - if you do the MPH right . It's actually IMO an awesome degree - you can get into TOP schools with less competition and you can get out of it truly amazing Education.


Healthcare and public health and work in a hospital at any level is not conducive to a bachelor degree. Many MPh grads have hard time finding work in standard MPh jobs . So for any job you are looking for there is probably a handful of MPh people .

I would go to grad school for MPH or MHA "
publichealth,"Others have explained it well.

However, if your bachelor's is in PH and you can find a job you'd be happy to work at for a year or two, even if it's only tangentially related, it may make focusing your MPH easier. I did not have direct PH experience at all, it's not necessary, but I had to put more effort into figuring out what I wanted to do and learn. Also, connections!

Edit: Pitt has a fairly strong program and it's not tooooo far, and I know some recent grads have landed in Ohio-I would highly recommend looking around their website to see if there's anything helpful to you there :)"
publichealth,"That's true of most fields, unfortunately. I was in a similar spot, but my BS was in chemistry and sociology. I have feelings about the mountains of debt that we overload ill-informed young adults with.

I took time off after I graduated college. I lived with my mom and worked in retail and food service and saved up some money. No regrets there, I had jobs where the work stayed at work and I could use my free time to figure out what I was doing.

I chose an MPH because it was something to do that vaguely interested me and I got a good scholarship offer from my program (paying out the ass for an MPH is honestly very rarely, if ever, worth it).

Sadly, I think having just a bachelor's is also much harder as a first gen college student-a lot of my friends who found employment did so through family connections, which I know I didn't have. I also didn't know how to look for or apply for jobs-my mother's been in the same job at the same place since before I was born, and most of my family and the people where I grew up assume that college = free high paying job. It does work out, but it can take a bit longer when you weren't given that head start. I know it's frustrating :/

"
publichealth,"My dad is a meat cutter and my mom doesn’t work. I’m not close to my relatives and don’t even know what they do for jobs. So I don’t have any kind of good background or support system when it comes to being “career driven”. I mainly chose PH because during the time I went to college I was into exercise and nutrition and PH seemed interesting. I just looked up avg PH jobs and saw it paid 40-70k a year and that’s about the extent of my research before I dived into college debt on my own thinking life will be better once I’m out. 

I did an internship with the YMCA for 6 months but I didn’t learn anything nor was I supposed to. They didn’t let me do anything because it’s a non paid and I guess there are policies to nonpaid stuff. It was mainly a waste of a time and any job opportunities would only pay 28k a year which was a joke in my opinion. 

What do you do in PH if you don’t mind me asking? What also made you get into it and make it a career choice moving forward?  

As of this very moment, I haven’t kept up to date on anything PH related. I have school documents/PowerPoints on my cloud drive so I can run through my notes and try to remember what I learned haha. If I could choose anything career wise and I have no idea what the job title would be or if I have to get a Master’s to do it, but I would want to be on a team that makes policies on a state level when it comes to health. I feel the govt doesn’t give one shit about it’s citizens and their health to the extent they should so everyone’s quality of life would be better. I want to fight to make it easier for people to have a better quality of life but get paid for it. 

I assume it would be getting into politics, which I know nothing about and I don’t know if my degree would even work towards it, but that’s what I would choose to do. It’s not a passion really, it’s more of a I’m sick of my shitty environment and town and want to be the person who changes it for the better for everyone else so people can have a better quality of life. I didn’t learn anything at school related to this, it’s all just ideas I have. The system is run by a bunch of old people with out of date rules and ideas regarding our well being and if I can bring in new ideas that’s better for everyone else, that’s what I would do for a career.

publichealth,"I'm still in grad school. I'm in epi, going back and forth about a PhD, but definitely taking some time to work and pay down what I owe from undergrad first. I work a handful of hours a week doing data analysis for a group at a local hospital, and I also work in fast food on the weekends to make ends meet. I'd like to work at the county or state level in the interim while I figure my shit out, but I've struggled a lot with what I want to do because I am better at and tend to enjoy things that require me to sit at a desk, but I also really struggle with the actual sitting at a desk part. 

Honestly...I totally feel your frustrations, and you sound a lot like me. If you're in a more rural county it's very unlikely there's a lot of openings anywhere there for you. My home county's health department is literally four people. Cities (someone else mentioned Columbus-I don't know too much about Ohio) would be better places to look, but honestly getting an MPH is not that hard, which is part of why (in my opinion) it's looked at as kind of an entry level degree. 

Even 15 years ago, it was not this hard to find a job as a recent graduate. But that doesn't mean things won't be okay in 5, 10, 15 years-and to be perfectly honest I know a lot of people in their late 30s/40s who are perfectly happy and successful and still paying off their college loans, so it's not a sentence to be miserable forever.

If you're interested in policy you can also look into MPP programs or internships in that area, and health policy programs which are often in schools of public health. I have heard that policy jobs are less concerned that you have a master's but I don't know how true that is, and I suspect that a high proportion of those jobs are in the DC area."

publichealth,"In a way I understand a little bit where it could hinder you in academia because you should probably be shooting to ""move up"" to better schools after each degree..."
publichealth,"I didn't go your route, however, I work for a European company with a lot of PhDs from the EU. I considered doing an EU PhD, but opted for a US based one instead after having some discussion with my colleagues. This is my insight. It could be right or could be wrong.. 

Doctorate programs in the EU are quite different, it's more applied than those in the US.  Pretty much there is no coursework, you get hired by a PhD supervisor (your adviser) and do your research over a few years and write your dissertation.

To me, A PhD is a PhD.. it shows that you can do the research and think analytically. 
 However, you might run into some issuescoming back to the US/working for a US company, as there are a group of people out there who feels a US based PhD is more rigorous than a EU one, since there is additional coursework needed. However, with years of post-PhD work experience, that should go away, as publications outweighs everything.

Lastly, networking.. where do you want to end up working? So if you graduated from a EU PhD program.. you won't have an american network to network for jobs.. and vice versa.. These days, a good number of jobs are obtained through networking.. Keep that in mind also"
publichealth,"Most European PhD programs expect you to have a supervisor, a project, and funding all sorted out when you start (compared to US programs where you choose a supervisor and project after you start).

Generally, a PhD is a PhD. Where you go doesn't matter as much it might in other fields like business, law, etc. What matters is your dissertation, your supervisor, and the network you build."

Reputation is also not how science works. Some of the worst research ever (Wakefield’s study linking vaccines to autism) was published in some one the most reputable journals (The Lancet).

publichealth,"&gt;Hi there! The rule of thumb is go to the cheapest ceph accredited school you can get into. 

Agreed. Harvard, Johnd Hopkins, or Emory may be worth the price. But outside of the top 10 the disparity is minimal.

An MPH doesn't earn that much starting, surely Drexel is not worth an extra $20k investment. 

Also, GMU has an excellent geography and GIS program. You may be able to squeeze some GIS training into your MPH coursework (grad certificate?). It seems to be a very useful qualification these days. An MPH friend of mine got offered $10k / year extra from a prospective employer when they realized she did GIS work too."

The program is virtually the same price as my state school in America (which I have also been accepted to) but I'm mostly wondering if it will put me behind compared to other graduates who were able to complete practicums and internships during their time at school. Plus it is accelerated so I doubt I would have the spare time to work in a research lab on the side, and I know firsthand that its quite easy to secure a paid assistantship in a lab at my state school...but the flipside is that I don't really want to work in the US after graduation and having a network abroad would be huge.

Thanks to that, I have had very few disappointments (apart from lower grades when I knew I could apply myself better etc).

It’s completely online and CEPH accredited. I was nervous going a) into an online program and b) a program not through somewhere like Emory or Hopkins, but the classes seem comparable, I’m learning a lot, and I currently work full time so online was the best option for me. The program through UNE also requires each student complete an internship and write a capstone/thesis paper. From the people I’ve talked to and the research I did about the program before beginning it, it seems like people who have a solid background get jobs fairly easily. The internship you have to do in the program is also great for networking (I’ll be at my local health department this summer). I think it’s definitely worth looking into! "

We really need to push cost benefit analysis and cost savings data in these situations..."
publichealth,"Absolutely. They have been doing this in Vancouver for years and it resulted not only in less deaths and overdoses, but safe injection sites also reduced medical costs. Less money spent on emergency responders, hospitalizations, and treatment for disease IDUs are especially at risk for, including HIV and Hepatitis C. "

Less money spent on emergency responders, hospitalizations, and treatment for disease IDUs are especially at risk for, including HIV and Hepatitis C. "
publichealth,"I'm honestly shocked that the debate still rages on so much in the states. Everyone else is moving on with it and has accepted the evidence. Here in Canada we're just approaching it as part of the continuum of harm reduction services between prevention and treatment. "
publichealth,"In my current state, it's not even legal to have needle exchange programs. So there are definitely some places in the US that are so so so far behind that need to catch up. "
publichealth,"If you have relevant experience, quite a few. Many schools will down weight your GPA if you can show growth and success in the workplace since finishing undergrad. 

But also I got into a CEPH accredited small state school with a similar GPA and everything has worked out okay. "
publichealth,"My LSHTM program sent me books to read and at the end of the course, there's a big assignment due. The online portion basically referred to the online discussion forum and the live tutorials that happen once every month or two. Oh, and sometimes there are live recordings of the lectures in London. But at the end of the program, what matters most is that I get a fancy piece of paper with the words ""London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"" on it, which I've been told are nice words.

I don't mind it so much despite being a bit disappointed by the way it's set up."
publichealth,"I’m a distance education student in my final semester earning a MPH. In all my time in the program, I think I’ve had maybe two courses that operated that way, however they were typically supplemented with quizzes, group work, and/or mandatory discussion boards. Also some text reading. It may just be that one professor who teaches that way. Is this class taught by a different professor? Can you change to their class? 

Take a look at the syllabus and see what else is ahead of you, as some professors don’t have everything posted straight away and add more content online as the semester progresses.

Also, I understand the frustration you feel with the comparison between cost and content, but remember, at SUNY you’re also paying for CEPH accreditation.

If you really don’t want to be a part of the program, check out alternatives. Don’t let this one class deter you from pursuing your goal. "
publichealth,"This is not a *public* health issue, it’s a **personal** health issue. If you have concerns about your health you need to seek professional medical guidance. Reddit is **not** the right place to seek medical advice."
publichealth,"Yes... I just have to keep myself motivated to earn that ""fancy piece of paper."" I'll have to think about upsides of doing this online i.e. I can take this course in my pajamas at home, without having to waste 2 hours of commute to school every day."
publichealth,"I guess it is set up very similar in other universities. My courses are also supplemented by text reading, quizzes, discussion boards, but live lecture videos would've been really helpful. There is only one professor that teaches each course so I don't really have a choice. 

Like G_atlanticus mentioned, I guess fancy diploma from CEPH accredited school is all that matters in the end. I'll have to suck it up and do it because I really need this degree for career transition. Thank you for your feedback!!"
publichealth,"If the public health school you wish to attend offers a certificate program, you should take it. If you do well, you should have far better chance of getting into the MPH program."
publichealth,"What type of work experience do you have? What are your GRE scores? My GPA was around 2.8 too and I was able to get into a pretty good school. But I applied twice, took MPH classes as a non matriculated student (I had to beg for this), and worked as a microbiologist for a government agency during a huge infectious disease crisis. I did not get into any epidemiology programs that I applied for because my GPA was too low, so your best bet is to aim for general MPH or ""global health"" tracks. Good luck!

publichealth,"My suggestion is to first look at where you live and identify a few programs and then apply to 4-5 total programs with several as a 'pretty sure I can get in here to 'dream program.' Seriously, just have a good personal statement discussing your growth from undergrad and your future goals. "
publichealth,"I got my mph from a New Hampshire university in 2015 and then have had a bit of trouble finding a job in the field since then, but my experience may be a bit atypical. Feel free to send me a message if you're interested in talking as well.."
publichealth,wow you have an impressive work experience! You shouldn't have any problem getting into MPH program at most schools as long as you get a decent score on the GRE.
publichealth,Seriously! Do well on the GRE and write an awesome essay about your experiences and you should be ok
publichealth,"I have never attended a fully online program, but I took Environmental Science and Health Policy/Management online during my MPH (and psyc 101 online in undergrad and the lecture portion of AP physics online in high school). Physics and Envr had occasional, short recordings on very specific topics, but psych and HPM had no audio. They all had readings (combination of textbook, journal articles, reports, interactive modules, etc.) followed by some combination of quizzes, problem sets, writing assignments, chat board participation, and group projects.

The difference in price comes from 1) the ""value""of the course/degree, which isn't directly related to the cost incurred by the school, 2) the additional resources you receive as a student beyond that class material (access to professors/mentoring, access to the library/journals, any internship connections they made, etc.), 3) the scale of the course (i.e., class size), and 4) the standards of the course and 5) the type of evaluations used in the class. Your CEPH accredited program is held to the standard of ensuring you meet specific public health competencies and that will probably mean extensive writing assignments that have to be graded by a professor or at least upper-level grad student. Coursera assignments are mostly multiple choice assessments and others use peer grading, but that's only possible for very simple assignments and wouldn't work for masters-level essays and CEPH would likely be very unhappy if a school only used multiple choice and peer-graded assessments."
publichealth,"Thanks, I will check that out!"
publichealth,"Thanks for the suggestion! They do not take graduate students though, just checked their eligibility criteria"
publichealth,"ORISE is more of a funding mechanism than a formal fellowship program, so the interview process varies. Interview questions, process and due diligence will all depend on the group and the expectations for the role."
publichealth,"I remember those uncertain times. While I was recently accepted to medical school, there are still times when I think about going somewhere else, like public health or therapy. Just remember that you do have options.

You could go the MPH route. There are a lot of options available for them, especially if you're interested in doing public policy. You could also go for MD/MPH or DO/MPH if you're truly interested. You could get a teaching license and teach public health, or you could do an internship with PeaceCorps and volunteer abroad to get a sense for what you truly love. 

Or, perhaps you don't need to do anything like that. Maybe you could just have a blog and write about health topics you are truly concerned about. It's a good way to show your passion for medicine and the community, as well as develop your writing skills.

Hope this helps.

publichealth,"I'm from Texas, so I may be biased. But two programs that come to mind include UNT Health Science Center and UT Southwestern.

As for what others say about MPH reflecting badly on your resume, don't worry about it. In this day and age, with the constant healthcare crises, the epidemics, and even public perception about these diseases, just do what you love. Your life's too short to worry about what others think."
publichealth,"Even though 1910 (general industry) and 1926 (construction) are different standards, for somebody who is coming into the field totally cold, they're close enough that there isn't a ""wrong"" one.  Typically, good instructors will point out when a standard is different between 1910 and 1926.  Often, when a standard is in 1926, it's the same as in 1910 and it either says the same verbage or just says to refer to it.

If you have to pick, pick a general industry one because it sounds like you want to do more chemical sampling, HAZCOM, that sort of thing, which lends itself a little more to general industry than construction.  But really, you can't go wrong, more education is good. "
publichealth,"Most likely general industry, unless it is a construction company. "
publichealth,"Check Switzerland! The universities and salary for PhD are fantastic. "
publichealth,"But isn't the coursework in a US PhD simply the coursework for a Master's degree? The US is one of few countries that don't require a Master's before getting a PhD, you ""earn"" the former on the way to a PhD. It seems like Euro programs simply say ""OK you have a Master's so for your PhD we'll just focus on research"". Besides OP already has an MPH."
publichealth,"[Turns out there are plenty of programs, who would've thought](https://www.google.com/search?ei=HtZaWvfRI67k_Qb0k6G4Bg&amp;q=masters+animal+epidemiology&amp;oq=masters+animal+epidemiology&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...2439.2439.0.2770.1.1.0.0.0.0.88.88.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.1iLI81OEJfY)"
publichealth,not always. some phd programs require a masters in order to enter the program.. which is majority of Epi programs and Biostats
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"Depends-I know at my university about half the coursework is part of the master's, but there's a few more advanced methods courses and such as well as some research-oriented courses and (for epi) I believe another stats class."

publichealth,"Sharp internship in SF health department "
publichealth,"Inequality is certainly a factor. Many impoverished people can't afford healthcare and may opt out, or may sign up for Medicaid, which pays for nothing at all. I've worked as a medical assistant for a couple of months, and there were many patients we had to turn away because Medicaid doesn't cover anything. This doesn't even include the elderly with Medicare. 

What's more, many doctors would prefer wealthier clients over poorer clients, simply because of the crushing medical school debt, and/or they want their dream lives. The pharmaceutical companies and politicians aren't helping either. After all, money makes the healthcare industry go round. 

In the end, I think healthcare is a game. As the redditvoluntaryist said below, the more resources you have, the healthier you'll be."
publichealth,"This is not a *public* health issue, it’s a **personal** health issue. If you have concerns about your health you need to seek professional medical guidance. Reddit is **not** the right place to seek medical advice."
publichealth,"Atlanta is the unofficial public health capital with a ton of agencies and NGOs and universities. Cost of living is probably also a lot cheaper than LA. The film industry is also booming.

You may also be comfortable in the South."
publichealth,"I've also heard it as you learn a perspective from each program you do as you learn from different professors (something I took to heart and is why I've done all my degrees at different universities). Each program has it's own goal and you learn a different position and level at other universities. My masters program had a wonderful staff and while their research was interesting and shaping, I've learned even more in a doctoral program from professors studying different things. "
publichealth,"it really depends what kind of role you want. so i have an MPH in epi and years later i went for an MS in applied stats while i worked as a statistician... i was able to land a job as a BioStatistician with just an MPH but often times, i felt i was lacking something.. since my job would pay for my MS.. i decided to do it."
publichealth,"I’m sorry that you’re not having much luck. It took me awhile to land a job in the field after graduation, so I understand how frustrating that can be. As cliche as it sounds, try to keep your head up and keep looking. Even if you don’t know anything food safety or occupational safety, still try for it! When I got my first job in food safety I barely knew anything except that I skipped most of that class in school. Most employers will provide you with decent training, so as long as you’re willing to learn, you can be successful. More than half of my coworkers at the health department didn’t know anything about food safety when they were hired on (they had generic biology/public health/exercise science backgrounds). 

To be honest, finding something even if it isn’t a perfect fit will help you build a resume and figure out what you do want to focus on. You don’t need to join professional associations (it doesn’t hurt but I’ve never seen anyone be turned away because of it). I’m not sure what parts of public health want certifications, but don’t be too put off by that. A lot of professional certifications require work experience before you can get them anyway so it won’t be an expectation for entry level candidates. The exceptions bring licenses required by law like nursing or the sanitarian in training license for environmental health."
publichealth,"I'm jealous of you. I am currently working on my MPH with an epidemiology emphasis focusing on zoonotic diseases, and I hope to go back later for DVM. I'm doing it backwards. "
publichealth,"Lol you wouldn't be jealous of my loans though! Honestly if you can get to where you want career wise without the DVM, I wouldn't recommend getting it. It's insanely expensive, even if you do it the cheapest way possible, and there is really only a good ROI with certain careers (owning a large practice, pharmaceutical consulting, some government jobs...) I wouldn't say I regret getting a DVM, but I would probably end up financially in a better place had I not gotten it and taken other paths. Oh well."
publichealth,"Thanks for your input! I have seen the one health MSc at Royal and LSHTD, and would love to pursue it....but it does seem like a bit of a gamble as to whether it would actually increase my employability. I have a lot of debt from vet school, so I'm really reticent to spend more money on a degree that might not end up paying off in terms of getting a good job or an increase in pay. That's initially what attracted me to an MPH, it seemed like a degree that could apply to a lot of field and would really increase my ability to land a public health job, but the more I look into it the more it seems maybe not."
publichealth,"Thanks! May I ask what kind of agency you work for? Is it public or private? It's interesting that a lot of public health people I talk to say that I generally wouldn't need an MPH, and that the DVM will give me a good foot in the door, but a lot of veterinarians seem to say the opposite. Maybe things are changing a bit, but a lot of vets I talked to who transitioned into public health say they needed the MPH for anything other than USDA jobs. I know the CDC EIS program used to only consider DVMs if they have an MPH or other equivalent degree, but I think that requirement has been loosened recently (though I'm not sure if in practice how many DVM-only people are admitted to that program). "
publichealth,"Thanks for the tip! I actually didn't know the FDA hired many veterinarians, so that's good to know. I do get a period of non-competitive eligibility for federal employment after Peace Corps, so hopefully I can leverage that to find some good job leads. If I don't have to spend more time and money pursuing an MPH, at least not right away, then that is ideal :)"

"
publichealth,"That's really good to know! There are SO MANY things you can do with an MPH degree so it's hard to narrow down what you really want to do and exactly how to get there. From my experience so far it's seemed that if you have a DVM you're more likely to be leading within studies and holding superior power. I think it's really cool you're in the peace corps. It's something I've always thought would be good for me. And I was considering it a couple years ago when I was single and getting rejected from a different masters program. "
publichealth,"I've never heard anyone say that getting your degrees from the same institution reflects poorly on a resume. Maybe if you're planning on going into academia? But for normal public health jobs it should be fine. I'd say if you like the program and it's affordable go for it, especially as you already have connections to the program that would probably make finding assistantships easier. See if you can talk to any current graduate students about how they like it there."
publichealth,"Go where it's the cheapest. "
publichealth,"I definitely have some really good connections already established, just due to my job and everything else. I appreciate the input!"
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,The cheapest possible accredited program
publichealth,"The program I talked about above is in the process of being accredited, they should be by spring 2019. Does that count?"
publichealth,"Will you being doing this full time or part time while working for the university?

If you're going full time, most MPH's are 2 year programs, so I'd say you're probably ok, but I'd be a little hesitant. 

If part time, then go ahead and start. 

Either way, keep your ears to the ground on the process of the accreditation. "
publichealth,"This is not a *public* health issue, it’s a **personal** health issue. If you have concerns about your health you need to seek professional medical guidance. Reddit is **not** the right place to seek medical advice."
publichealth,"The idea would be to go full-time, so I'll definitely poke around for more information on accreditation. Unfortunately, I'd be leaving my job while in grad school, whether I go to the same university or not. My school's dean's office has a really strong policy on grad students not working in the same office that they're a student for - too much access to private information and class details. "
publichealth,"Try to leverage your connections for a GA or TA position that will give you a tuition waiver and a small stipend in exchange for like 20 hours of weekly work helping a professor. "
publichealth,"That makes sense. Truthfully, think of your situation like this: there’s very little in public health you’re barred from doing with the education and background you currently have, but if you did it in reverse and had an MPH but no DVM, you couldn’t do any clinical practice with animals. Sure, some places hiring might want a more human-centric focus, but vets are actually uniquely situated to be a major force in frontline defense for public health because they can try to stop spillover events before they happen. Maybe also check out the Eco Health Alliance or other similar orgs?"
publichealth,I work for a *very* large local health jurisdiction. And EIS will consider you without MPH if you have the right relevant professional experience.
publichealth,"&gt; as long as it doesn't cost any money.

That isn't a factor. They are still allowed to spend money on it."
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,Which school are you leaning towards?
publichealth,"I went to Tulane, and there was no tuition assistance at the Master’s level - but that varies wildly across programs. I did the MSPH instead of an MS, and I found it gave me a leg up when applying for jobs. I had the statistical knowledge, and a broader understanding of public health to back it up. Employers seemed to find it interesting. If you have a desire to work in pharma or a more academic setting, an MS would probably be better, but at most programs the coursework for both tracks is probably pretty similar. "
publichealth,"I know what you mean! I applied to San Diego State, and I'm not sure they're gonna get back to me before tuition deposits are due at other places :o "
publichealth,"Oof. Columbia? But also, I *just* got the acceptance at BU and they said I qualified for a merit scholarship, soooo.... 

Honestly I'm so in a tizzy right now about where to go. "
publichealth,"Is SDSU one of your top choices?  I wanted to apply there too, but was a bit unsure if I wanted to make the move down to SoCal.  I'd preferably like to stay local, unless the right scholarship package came around!"
publichealth,"I guess having options is always nice, right?  :D.  I have heard so many mixed things about where to go for MPHs though.  I've read that it isn't worth coming out of an MPH with an extreme amount of debt since the return on investment might not be great, but have also seen that going to a bigger name school matters at time.  There are so many factors that go into choosing the right program.. haha.  "
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"My roommate went there for social work and really loved it! They are supposedly quite good at giving aid, and SD is cheaper than LA from what I've heard. 

They're my top choice for the price point, but I'm not 100% sure I want to stay on the West Coast, and I have to pay for anywhere I go, including staying in Socal (living at home isn't an option). "
publichealth,"Having options is amazing... definitely don't wanna complain about that :) but making the choice seems impossible right now! I like that Columbia has a 98% employment rate 6 months after graduation. 


I think it's balancing good programs vs. amount of debt... With my lack of experience I don't want to just go to a state school that's whatever, because I think that's a better choice for people who have some experience and want to get an MPH on top of that. I like that SDSU is a state school that's actually on the rankings, and SD has good public health agencies. "
publichealth,"Nice!  Plus you still have the sun!  Can't beat that.  I have to admit, the price points for the state schools here are much nicer than privates and the UCs.  Well for now you have options, and hopefully lots of time to make a decision!  Best of luck :)"
publichealth,"Wow, that is an amazing statistic from Columbia!  I wonder if it is 98% of respondents to a survey, or actually 98% of their graduates.  Either way, that is pretty cool!  Also, I think one thing to take in mind is where you want to end up afterwards.  Developing a network in the area you end up in may always help!

All good points.  Is the SDSU MPH stand-alone?  I remember looking and seeing that they had a joint program with UCSD, but that might have been their PhD.  "
publichealth,"I am working on my MSHA - in my 2nd year of a 3 year program. I’ve recently accepted a great offer for an administrative fellowship (for the third year), as did all of my classmates. Those who have studied in the cohorts before me are quite successful and from what I’ve seen there are great job opportunities and a lot of them “rise through the ranks” pretty quickly. As far as choosing a program, I would make sure to choose one that is CAHME accredited. It also is super beneficial to the students if there is a strong alumni network, so that may be something to keep in mind. I hope that helped a bit! Let me know if you have any other questions 


Also as far as traveling goes, I interviewed with several consulting firms during my fellowship search. If you are interested in traveling that may be an avenue to look out for!"
publichealth,"Thanks for the reply! From the sound of it, id be more interested in the public health aspect besides just plain stats since I came from a clinical background. Good to hear employers find it interesting. "
publichealth,"I am very sorry to hear you are not happy with your job.  Bright side, you can always find a different job.  For example, I'm an RN with my MPH and the RN portion sounds like something I'd be very interested in.  There are so many research companies across the US.  Now you know for the future to ask during an interview what the day to day is going to be like and how you would be involved.  Be more forthcoming about what role you want in the company.  Best advice I can offer. :)"
publichealth,"I'll take your job, sounds great to me! How is the pay?"
publichealth,"Sometimes it just doesn't work out like you planned. I once took a job that sounded excellent on paper but in practice was not at all what I wanted to do. I think if this isn't a fit for you, try to apply elsewhere and if possible try to talk to individuals at those places you're interested in to see what the work is actually like. Good luck!"
publichealth,"I think they have like an 82% response or something?

publichealth,"Sure thing! If you ever have any questions, feel free to message me - I did a last minute switch into biostats, and I definitely love it, but it's always nice to have some idea of what you're getting yourself into. "
publichealth,"@OP do you by any chance work for medpace? "
publichealth,I am in the same boat. I'm sorry :( Any way you can do some certifications/post-grad courses to help switch gears?
publichealth,"I'm also about 3 years out of my MPH program and have found my ""dream job"" to be...not quite a dream. Just another person chiming in to say we are in the same boat. And the good news is, 3 years is so early in our careers and it should really get better from here. We just have to be more intentional when applying for future opportunities. 
I don't expect to get it right the next time either. But maybe in ten years I'll have a more solid idea of what my dream job really is, and then I can work towards it. "
publichealth,I don't
publichealth,"Thank you. Yes, it's hard to really be able to have a solid idea of what my dream job would be. I just know that I want to feel like what I do is making a meaningful difference and I want to enjoy the work."
publichealth,"Reading it at first, I thought you already had the fellowship. I wouldn't turn down a job or a promotion if you aren't sure you're landing this fellowship.

Are you planning on pursuing a PhD or something like that? If that's the case then the fellowship would be pretty helpful as you get to design your own projects. But again, you need to have a backup if the fellowship doesn't come through."
publichealth,"You will still be able to use whatever you learn or accomplish at the current job to pitch yourself to future employers. How about applying as a coordinator for public health research projects in academia or health services at a clinic or non-profit agency? Program manager, outreach coordinator, recruitment coordinator, evaluation coordinator, HIV prevention coordinator, etc. Universities with a school of public health where faculty serve as active PIs would also be a good start. There are positions at studies and programs where participant interaction does not require medical experience, but if your interest is in vaccines, that might limit you to clinical trials. Aside from universities, government and military research institutions (see Leidos and Henry Jackson Foundation listings) might be a better fit. Different pharmaceutial clinical research sites might have different expectations for CRCs, too. Your dream job may still be your dream job at a different company."
publichealth,Hey there! I'm at Umich SPH but a different program so I can't speak much to that but I do know about the school in general if you have questions!
publichealth,"Cornell is best known for anything related to nutrition.  If you wanted to go into an position most related to nutrition, I'd definitely pick Cornell, but that's not what you want to go into.  I'd look into whether or not UM is strong in what you want to go into or not. Both are great schools, UM is considered public ivy.  It's also dependent on where you'd like to end up, you will network and geographically if you are from or prefer the midwest, UM may be it for you, if you like the East Coast, maybe Cornell would be a good fit.  "
publichealth,Go where it will be cheaper
publichealth,"As a professional epi- this is the way to decide. "
publichealth,"UM offered me a small scholarship, and Cornell might match it, so that's not really a deciding factor. I also don't really see epidemiology on its own as my end goal."
publichealth,"UM is strong in what I want. Cornell doesn't have it, but apparently they'll help me get where I want? I'm just weighing the pros and cons of going to UM and then being locked in to my career path vs going to Cornell and having the option, but also looking into other things. I.e. stability vs flexibility. "
publichealth,"&gt; Cornell doesn't have it, but apparently they'll help me get where I want?

Every school will tell you this, but it doesn't make it true. You need to ask them specifics about their track record with students interested in your specific field. Unless they can cite specific internship and employment connections they have that have placed actual students into the field (whom they can connect you with directly), their promises are meaningless."
publichealth,"That's fair. The thing is, Cornell's program is brand new. They don't even have a graduating class yet. I just don't know how much a degree from Cornell will even be worth, though it has a good reputation for other things."
publichealth,"Cornell has a single accredited MPH program, which doesn't offer a concentration that fits your professional interests and they don't even have an accredited school of public health. UM is the #4 SPH in the country with a concentration in exactly what you want to do and is similarly priced, if not cheaper. This should be a ridiculously easy decision."
publichealth,"Fair enough. I've already agonized over the other two schools I got accepted to, UCLA and Boston University, and I guess I'm just someone who gets anxious about making the wrong choice."
publichealth,"How do you like your program/the school? Are faculty helpful? Do you think it sets you up for a competitive career in public health? How are internship/job opportunities? "
publichealth,"Total agreement.  Unless it's a top program (say Emory), go where it's cheap/convenient for you.  Unless you're really into a specific research area"
publichealth,"I am currently in the industrial hygiene program at Umich. I just sent you a message! "
publichealth,"as long as your school is accredited, it doesn't really matter where you go. 

if after graduation you plan on living in same area, go to that school as you can get a leg up on networking or job placement. otherwise go where it will be cheapest."
publichealth,"Michigan no contest . Since you also mentioned UCLA , for me it would have been between those 2.
I live near Cornell so that is out just due to location . Cornell at this point is a no name public health school 

Michigan is a great well known public health school wiht your concentration "
publichealth,"Actually now that you mention it, I am still considering UCLA, since it also offers the program I want. Also, you know, the weather is wayyyy better. But they haven't offered me any sort of scholarships, so unless UM gives me a tiny amount (haven't received offer yet, but know I'm getting something) I'll probably go to UM over UCLA.

Thank you for your input!"
publichealth,"I went from a bsc in psych to MSc in epi &amp; biostats. The psych background is useful because   
a. You are familiar with basic analysis tests, which will help you to understand more advanced methods.  
b. You are aware of bias and design issues which plague epidemiology just as much as psychology   
  
As for epi vs biostats, frankly there is so much overlap between the subjects, plus  difference between universities, it's hard to generalise. You really need to see the specific classes offered.   
  
For your career goals I would seek courses offering classes in modelling, clinical trials, and SAS. That's more important than the name of the MS.  
  
Edit: as for class pre-requisites - in my psych course I took a few quantitative methods classes which covered t-tests, non-parametrics, ANOVA, univariate regression, and that was my limit. I didn't do anything in calc. Biology classes shouldn't be a requirement - several people on my MS came from a pure maths background. Biology really just forms the context of the analysis question."

publichealth,"Hi, 
A few big topics you might want to be looking into would be Epidemiology - Populations, sampling, survey types, and modes of research, death ratios/percentages per x amount of population.
Healthcare Policy - Medicare/Medicaid, Abortion ect.
Community Health - Vaccines, health education, sex ed., health promotions.
maybe take a look at these two links and just look at the terms to see if these things will spark your memory. Great books to own and to teach from! https://www.jbpub.com/essentialpublichealth/skolnik/2e/glossary.aspx - Global Health

publichealth,I wouldn't recommend joining unless they have some kind of networking or mentoring program that you can take advantage of. I'd also recommend looking into CSTE because I know that they have a mentoring program and they have reasonable student rates.
publichealth,Not being CEPH-accredited is the clincher. Go with Emory.
publichealth,"You can't go on with either or. It depends you want to be trained more in study design or analysis.. But you can jump back and forth.

publichealth,"I graduated last year after transferring there from Georgia State's MPH program, so I can comment directly on how Harvard compares to other programs.

*  In my experience, Harvard's Epi MPH is more quantitatively heavy than other programs, which is a good thing. We used Stata instead of SAS or R for most projects, so keep in mind that you'll need to teach yourself SAS/R concurrently with what you learn in Stata if you want to keep yourself competitive for jobs that use those platforms (e.g., CDC). 

* The Harvard MPH Epi program is more heavily focused on chronic diseases than infectious disease, which some of my classmates felt frustrated about. 

* Extremely collaborative as opposed to cutthroat. 

Feel free to shoot me a PM if you have other questions. I highly recommend the program and think it is one of the few exceptions to the ""go to the cheapest CEPH-accredited school you get into"" adage."
publichealth,"I graduated in 2017 from UMich IH. Feel free to ask any questions. 

I would recommend looking into ABET accredited programs with an ERC if you're really considering IH. These schools have a track record and funding available for students.

One thing to consider at Michigan, if you are passionate about consulting is Dennis Paustenbach is an alum and started the well respected firm Chemrisk. Now Cardno Chemrisk. There is also Bureau Veritas nearby as well as the NSF. These companies have established relationships with the EHS department, especially NSF and Chemrisk."
publichealth,"""Good TimeOfDay!

I'm ash557 and I'm a current MPH student at GWU. [Insert anecdotal blurbs]. I found your department/organization after researching institutions that align with my interests and that I could foresee myself working in a similar environment. If you by chance take on interns and have any openings I'd love to hear about any opportunities you may have!

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Saying that a flu pandemic reaching category 4 would stop the world as we know it feels like an absurd oversimplification given that swine flu reached phase 6.

publichealth,"I would take a look at the post about the person going to Miami University in Ohio to see that yes, CEPH is important for picking a school. Now CPH, that’s a ripoff"
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,"...Don't do it. There is very little funding for MPH's and that cost is astronomical. 

I've got an MPH and I can tell you 100% that it's not worth 1/3rd of that cost. I went $50,000 in the hole for mine (financed living expenses) and it was a HUGE mistake. JHSPH is awesome, no problem there, but the ROI on that degree for that cost is awful. You will regret this for the rest of your life. 

Think of it this way, whatever your interest is, you could fund and complete a PhD program in that area, get a job that pays double (even if you go into field work and not research) and have no debt with a great income 6-7 years from now. With the MPH, you're going to be saddled with this debt for decades because you won't earn enough to pay it off. Public service loan forgiveness is becoming more uncertain by the week and student loans are non-bankruptable. 

People don't often consider this, but when you're fighting to pay off debt for decades, you're suspending saving for retirement to do so (or at least not saving as much as you could). This means every year you wait, that's a year of capitalization you lose, and it's the LAST year you lose, not the first. 

Think of it this way, let's assume you were age 25 currently. If you do the JH thing and don't get it funded, you'll be 27 when you get your first post MPH job (assuming the program starts in the fall and it takes you a few months to find a good job...and assuming you get a job at all). You'll start out making between 35,000 - 45,000 in most places(don't believe career counselors who say you'll start higher, you won't. I make 45,000 and am the highest paid member of my graduating cohort), more in big cities with higher costs of living. That's 2500/month after taxes. By the time you rent a basic place, pay utilities, eat, transportation, etc, you MIGHT have $500/month to throw at the loan. 

If you only borrow program costs and not living expenses, you'll borrow $96k. At 500/month, you'll end up paying $256,000 and it will take you 42 years(naturally you'd take the forgiveness at 10 or 20 years but still).

On top of that, if instead of paying that 500/month to debt, you could save 500/month for retirement starting at 27 and retiring at 75, assuming a 6% return, you'd have 1.4 million dollars...hope you like the degree...

Not to mention the time delay. If it takes you 20 years to get out from under your debt, you won't be investing until nearly age 50! even if you went crazy and contributed $1500/month from 50 to 75 it's only $356,000 in your nest egg. 

If instead, you did the PhD thing(don't go anywhere that doesn't offer to fully fund you), you would be starting work around age 30 with no debt. You could still have a public health career, but instead of being in debt, you could immediately start investing, likely to the tune of at least $1000/month. 

1000/month from 30 to 75 with a 6% return is still 1.1 million. 


This is a long winded way of saying if by some magic you get FULLY funded, then go, if you choose to borrow for this, you will almost assuredly never retire....just keep that in your mind as the prestigious school beckons. "

publichealth,How difficult has that made things for you in terms of learning the material? I took French in HS and know some Spanish. Enough to get the jist of what I'm reading. I too have been looking in Europe for programs and language has been a big hurdle.
publichealth,"It seems premature for the authors to even mention marijuana dispensaries, and I'm disappointed to see it highlighted as a sub title.   "
publichealth,I agree completely specifically because I have that data for my state and I haven't even found someone to analyze it. Speculation based on nothing is unhelpful.
publichealth,A good friend of mine was accepted to this program and turned them down because of the price. She picked up a free ride MPH at Emory instead based on her earlier work in public health - boots on the ground stuff which they liked. Hopkins is an excellent program but I'm not sure how they rationalize causing that much debt in people that are interested in a field that isn't typically a giant money maker.
publichealth,"Thank you for this insightful response. Did you go the PhD route? "
publichealth,"Thanks for the insight, I applied to
Emory too. Hopefully they will be more generous with funding. "
publichealth,"I am fortunate enough to have landed a position with my state university, so I am currently utilizing the tuition benefit to slowly move towards a PhD. I will likely pursue it full time in a couple of years when I have a more targeted research interest and some more research experience under my belt. "
publichealth,"depends on what you want to do, but they are all pretty similar"
publichealth,"Aren't they both about the same? They're both in the same APHA section- PHEHP. 

Also, with either, you usually need a masters to be able to find a good job. "
publichealth,They're both pretty similar. I have a BS in community health education and we practice various aspects of health promotion. I've also seen them both as MPH concentrations.
publichealth,"You can read some student reflections [here](https://thephinnewsletter.wordpress.com/category/newsletter-main-categories/student-life/m1-students/) (M1) and [here](https://thephinnewsletter.wordpress.com/category/newsletter-main-categories/student-life/m2-students/) (M2). "
publichealth,"Hey, I was also accepted at and will be attending CSPH at Anschutz! I don't know about any special scholarships or anything, but I have been going back and forth with Admissions about financial aid, and their system is different than other schools. While other schools will give you a financial aid package before you decide where to go, at CSPH you have to accept their offer first before they can give you an estimate for a package. Which is quite dumb and turns a lot of people off. I accepted once it appeared that I wouldn't be getting any scholarships from the other schools I applied to, since the overall cost of the degree was roughly the same. So, if you want to wait on a financial aid package before accepting, don't, because it won't happen.

At the very least, you can qualify for in-state tuition for the second year in Colorado, so my plan is to take a slightly lighter load my first year and take more credits my second year since it will be cheaper as I am also out-of-state. As I mentioned, with 1 year out-of-state and 1 year in-state, the total cost of the degree at Colorado was the same as my in-state school (Michigan), and the school that offered me in-state tuition (Minnesota), so the price isn't that bad. "
publichealth,"I Justin finished my MPH from CSPH. I was a resident. I paid with student loans that included living expenses. My debt is $99,000. "
publichealth,"Probably the better question is where should I get my MPH after I get this bachelors "
publichealth,"Echoing what others have already suggested and generalizing for others who might be in a similar position:

Apply for any scholarships you can find. It might feel tedious now, but you can save thousands of dollars with just hours of work, and the more scholarships you get, the easier it is to get more.


You can often defer your acceptance for one year if you speak with admissions. Consider using that time to establish state residency and to get a job. Ideally, the job will be related to public health, at the university, and/or so profitable that it makes the cost of education a non-issue. The latter is not always an option, so I'll focus on the first two. Note: this is worthwhile if the tuition difference for in-state and out-of-state students is extreme, and if you can get a job that will contribute to the value of your education. Delaying a year also has opportunity costs that not everyone can afford, so keep that in mind. 

If you can get a job at the university, there is often an associated employee discount. At the most basic level, that helps financially. It you can get a job at the university that allows you to work with professors whose classes you will take, you've opened the door for mentorship opportunities that should be (but are not always) a key component of a good MPH education. 

If you can get a public health-related job, you will not only enhance your education with practical experience while expanding your CV, but you will likely get more support pursuing your MPH while maintaining that job through school.  


Make yourself useful to professors/researchers at the university once you get there. Be the person they want to hire for odd jobs (of which there are many wherever there is research). You might, for example, learn some basic database management, statistical analysis, or field work skills and let professors know that you would like to work toward developing those skills further. Again, this increases the value of your education by giving you practical experience, maximizing the potential for great mentorship and recommendations, and providing future employers with better performance measures than classroom grades. Like scholarships, once you get that first in-house job, others will more easily follow (assuming you do a reasonably good job). 

I have no direct experience getting loans, but vicarious experience indicates that avoiding them when possible is often the best route. Substantial loans can limit your opportunities once you have your degree. If you are loan-free, you can make decisions that will benefit you in the long-run even if they do not pay off in the short-term. Loans make the most sense when the degree you get pays off handsomely - for example, if it places you in a high-earning field or gets you a substantial promotion where you already work. An MPH can lead to a high paying job, but a lot of people getting that degree primarily want to do the kind of work that does not pay off as much monetarily as it does in life satisfaction. Lenders, unfortunately, are not appeased with life satisfaction. 


I will also note that once you have your degree, you'll notice that the degree helps you get your foot in the door when applying for jobs, but it is your work experience that employers will really be interested in. Often, that is what will get you hired.

Best of luck to you!"
publichealth,"I went to NYU for undergrad and majored in Global Public Health while I was there. I also spent a lot of time with admin in the college and worked with MPH and PhD students there--but I wasn't in the program myself so take everything I say with a grain of salt!

NYU is a new program; it only started 2-3 years ago. This comes with some challenges, e.g. not enough classes; some profs were originally tied to the medical school and this is their second priority; working out kinks in classes/requirements/capstone projects; the rest of the college doesn't really know that CGPH exists. However, I do know that the deans are striving to make NYU a top 20 or top 10 school within a few short years. I personally think they will achieve this, meaning your degree will become a lot more valuable in the future. 

Other pros-- I've loved the professors I've had or worked with. Lots of cool research happening in tobacco, sexual health, obesity, social entrepreneurship, etc. Studying abroad is a big thing at NYU, and I know there's public health classes for undergrad in London, Accra, Abu Dhabi, and Sydney (not sure for grad level though).

TLDR: I've definitely heard grumbles about the way the program is currently run. But, there's bound to be a huge amount of change in the coming years and the reputation of NYU will only grow better. I enjoyed my time there a lot. "

publichealth,"Hi there--

I graduated from BU recently, concentrating in Epi. I worked there full time as an RA and took classes part time, so a slightly different experience than a full time student. 

I absolutely loved BU. I loved the breadth and depth of courses and experiences. The dean Galea started there about the same time that I did, and he is wonderful. Professors are wildly intelligent while still being very accessible. 

The campus is not part of the main BU campus, and it depends what you are looking for, but it is a typical ""city"" campus. Not many places to play frisbee but you get what you need. Boston itself is a wonderful city to be a student (but pricey). 

For HIV specifically, I know tangentially of a few professors doing very interesting stuff. You may want to reach our to Dr. Matt Fox. He does a lot of HIV research and teaches high level analytic epi classes. https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/matthew-fox/

The one negative is the price tag. If you can get a full time job at BU, you can qualify for tuition remission. Unless you have the money, I really don't think an MPH is worth the debt. 

Ask me anything else you would like. "
publichealth,"When Congress failed to re-authorize CHIP funding on October 1, they also failed to re-authorize federal funding for the NHSC and FQHCs. Generally all three programs (CHIP, NHSC, FQHCs) have bi-partisan support, but this time the GOP wants to fund them by taking money from CMS and the CDC/NIH. In other words, robbing Peter to pay Paul, and the Democrats aren't having it. So, they're at an impasse. Just before the year ended, they passed a brief extension for all programs through January. But, if you're running a community health center, it's kind of hard to make a budget if you don't know if you're going to receive your federal funding down the road. 

Long story short, if Congress doesn't extend funding for FQHCs, then there will be thousands of layoffs, hundreds of closed sites, and millions will lose access to primary care (FQHCs treat about 1/12 of all Americans). Here is an [infographic](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/nachc/pages/297/attachments/original/1507140643/NACHC_Funding_Cliff_Infographic_Oct_2017.png?1507140643).

publichealth,"If you’re assessing barriers to implementation in the UK, does this mean you are UK-based? 

If so, some background on the US system may help: the corrections system in the United States is pretty fragmented. It’s simultaneously para-militaristic and hierarchical, as well as decentralized. Typically, we have two types of correctional institutions: prisons and jails. Jails are run by the local government unit (municipality or county, or unified municipality and county, or unified neighboring municipalities and counties); whereas prisons are run by either the state or federal government. Often times, States have law/policy that specify sentences of less than a year result in incarceration in a jail, where as sentences of a year or more result in incarceration in a state prison. States will sometimes pay local government units to incarcerate people in jails despite that their sentences are longer than a year (a way to save money and shift the burden of overcrowding to local government). People get placed into federal prison when they are convicted of a crime that falls under jurisdiction of the federal government (or if you’re convicted of a felony in Washington, DC). The federal prison system (or Bureau of Prisons (BOP facilities here on out)) operate facilities throughout states across the US. BOP facilities, jails, and prisons can be run by public or private entities — or even split (Obama attempted to phase out private run BOP facilities, but I think Trump reverses that). If you want to learn about specific rules, regulations, and policies, I suspect you might be better off looking at the BOP. State and local corrections agencies/entities don’t go out of their way to make rules, regs, and policies available; furthermore, wardens of prisons and sheriffs (who run the jails) exercise a lot control over what the rules and policies, etc, they chose to set, implement, or ignore. While BOP facilities also have that, it may be easier to get information in about BOP in general. Private run facilities seem to be subject to adhering to bare minimum standards when it comes to health and safety of jails, prisons, and BOP facilities. They seem to set their own rules, so really depends if any government entity or oversight entity is enforcing certain rules, regs, or policies. 

All this said, you might find it easier to compare federal systems opposed to the locally run systems. I wouldn’t *not* look into smoking bans at the state and local level in the US — it’s just going to require a lot more digging and the extent to which these bans are enforced is probably a bit of a gamble.

While having background in the subject is highly suggested, you can definitely get a job in it. Sometimes it is all about getting some of the right certs. Like OSHA 10 or some sort of OSHA approved safety awareness course. 

Also even if Hospitals don''t know what public health is there are a lot of branches within Public health.  Public health super broad but hospitals without a doubt have departments in specific fields. EHS is a department hospitals definitely have.

Even in a professional setting a little nerding goes a long way—I made friends with my current mentor through asking them a whole lot of questions and taking opportunities to assist them on projects. I’ve learned a ton and now have a better sense of where I want to take my career than when I started."
publichealth,"You mentioned in the comments that you don't really care much about the field anymore, so why not just apply for general entry level jobs outside the field? It's really rare to snag a great job in your field right out of college - most people have to do stuff that's boring, low-paid, or not related to your degree for a least a little while.

I'd recommend broadening your search to non-public health jobs while also keeping your eye on stuff in the field. If you do decide you want to stay in the field/pursue an MPH, then you could also find places in town to volunteer to keep your experience fresh (there are tons of health-related nonprofits that desperately need volunteers)."
publichealth,"What is your current major? Gaining experience in public health or a public health adjacent field may help you to both figure out if environmental health is a good fit for your interests and mitigate not so great grades. It may also give you the opportunity to save some money/pay off some debt and explore programs that would be a good fit. "
publichealth,"Hi Sorry for not responding sooner.  I currently work as an Environmental Health and Safety Specialist at a consulting company in NYC.  I deal with a range of subjects from indoor air quality to mold assessments and exposure assessments.  

I realized I liked this based on the practicum I had between years 1 and 2 of my MPH.  I worked at a similar company for my practicum and so I learned an insane amount of information.  I wasn't too sure until it was time to look for a job a the end of second year.  But I realized I was good at it and I liked the mystery in it.  While some of the work is proactive, a lot of is retroactive. So it kind of feels like being a detective. I love interacting with clients, whether it is property managers or building engineers. And I am always learning something new whether it is about worker safety or doing moisture mapping after a flood, i always try and find some excited or joy in it!

publichealth,"Health promotion or health education generally requires a lot of collaboration.  You may be the only person working on a certain program in your office but you need to collaborate with different agencies and the public to get the job done.  

I am quiet and reserved but certainly not an introvert.  In health promotion I have worked with: babies,  high school students, parents, low income public, teachers, city councils, district attorney, local police, sheriff, state senators and assembly members,  CPS social workers,  doctors, other local agencies, and state funded projects. 

I actually work in health promotion policy and it is not for the faint of heart.  I'm not trying to scare anyone away but you must have a passion for it, policy is not for everyone.  The pay can be minimal for the work you're doing.  The fight for health policy is a struggle to use science and economics to negate what I'll call ""big- anti- heath"" (say big tobacco,  Soda companies, anti-vaxxers, marijuana supporters, the gun supporters).  "
publichealth,"I'm in the process of applying for a premed postbacc program with the intent to commit to an MD-MPH program and I am also extremely interested in policy regarding healthcare for underserved populations. Could we be friends? :)

One of my friends recommended I start with attending an event such as the annual Lobby Day, and network with people about their jobs and interests:
https://cahpsa.org/lobby-day/

One of my professors is also a retired medical coding supervisor with a JD. I can pass your questions by her.
"
publichealth,"Wow, lobby day looks amazing, but it's all the way in California... I'm in NY! But I'll look into similar events in my area, good idea. 

And we can most definitely be friends! Good luck with your program and if you do pass along questions to your professor, I may even become your BEST friend! (: "
publichealth,"Thank you so much for your insight. I already began looking into DSRIP programs and it's a good place to get started. I'm thinking MPH is the choice for me as well! "
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"That's interesting. I had spoken with CRAs at Medpace (it's been a couple of year now), and that was the information they gave me. Clearly, there are some differences in how things work now, or I may have been missing some information to begin with. Sorry about that! I didn't mean to steer you in the wrong direction. "
publichealth,I absolutely love it Trump!
publichealth,"I worked as a clinical research coordinator before starting PA school. The position varies from place to place; at my clinical trials office, CRCs did pretty much everything regarding the coordination of studies: recruiting, managing visits, performing vitals and venipuncture, some clinician assessments, data entry, reviewing of data, coordinating with CRAs and the IRB.

I had no clinical or real research experience before starting my position, which was not a problem. My boss was essentially looking for someone who was organized, normal, good with people, smart, a fast learner, able to deal with stressful situations, etc.

What is the job description? That's going to tell you a lot about what to expect and what kind of questions to ask. Depending on the office, you may have no patient interaction, or you may have a lot of patient interaction (or maybe the studies won't even have patients)."
publichealth,"I worked as a CRC for a year and a half as clinical experience before starting PA school. It really depends on the place...knowledge about clinical research was absolutely not required at my office. We were all trained on the job. My boss was looking for competent go-getters who were planning on applying to med school, PA school, or some other graduate program."
publichealth,"I'm currently a msph student in an industrial hygiene program and I agree with all of this. A few of the people in my program have backgrounds in finance, psychology, and other fields that weren't related to IH. They went back and took then prerequisites and all got in obviously. So just make sure you take bio, gen chem, o chem, and physics. Most schools list their prerequisites and for the most part they all require those. I also recommend niosh Erc programs. There's a ton of scholarship money in IH. Pretty much every American in my program is getting 50% tuition paid by niosh. "
publichealth,"Well, I’d look at both job descriptions and leadership of any agency of which you’d like to apply. If the non-clinical leadership holds doctorates, and the job descriptions mention them as well, then hey! You might have a shot. If they don’t, then I’d just apply with the mph and keep the PhD to myself ;)

"

publichealth,"I’ve worked in clinical research for 7+ years, and have interviewed people for several entry level coordinator jobs. It’s important to be very detail oriented and have excellent time management. You should try to demonstrate at least a basic understanding of the drug development process/study phases. In my experience, MedPace seems to like employing young people right out of school for fairly low starting salaries, so I think you might be okay not having much experience."
publichealth,"I graduated with a BS in Public Health last spring, and have recently started working as an entry-level clinical research coordinator. I work at a private ophthalmology practice that’s currently conducting fourteen or so clinical trials. The research director specializes in treating glaucoma, so most of the trials are for investigational stents and last about three years.  We find and enroll patients into the studies (which can be a major pain, this is probably my least favorite part), obtain informed consent, lots of data entry, and ensure the trials adhere to good clinical practice and IRB protocols.

Research experience wasn’t required for this job, and I didn’t have any beyond projects and labs in college. They wanted someone that was organized, detail-oriented, and good with patients. That’s why I really recommend looking at MedPace’s job description and familiarizing yourself with the research they’re doing, as it’ll give you a better idea of what they’re looking for. I had worked as an ophthalmic technician before, and was therefore already familiar with ophthalmology and working up patients. The clinical research coordinators at my job must become certified ophthalmic medical scribes (and are encouraged to become certified technicians/assistants/medical technologists/etc via increased salary incentives), as the research they do at this practice requires us to obtain patient histories, perform diagnostic testing, and assist the doctors as they examine them, treat them, or perform surgery. That’s how I was able to get hired.

The paperwork and red tape can be really annoying, but I actually really enjoy my job for the most part. I was fortunate enough to find a position that did research in an area I already knew a little about and liked, and has a nice balance of clinical work, continuing education, and data management. I’ve been thinking of going to graduate school for a MPH in epidemiology for more senior-level positions, and/or continuing to work to gain more experience. Good luck!"
publichealth,"Thanks for the reply. The only job description it has is this. Doesn't seem too complicated and I'm sure they train me how to do it all.

""Engage in clinical trial management on a day to day level;
Work closely with the project CTM for timely delivery of recurrent tasks consistently with a high degree of accuracy;
Compile and maintain project-specific status reports;
Interact with the Sponsor, study sites, and internal associates;
Create and maintain project timelines; and
Coordinate project meetings and produce quality minutes."""
publichealth,There are dozens of us!
publichealth,"Do well in calc 3 and see if you can pick up linear algebra along the way. 
You should also know what R is!"
publichealth,"That’s good, it sounds like they’re not necessarily looking for related experience then. It can’t help to review IRB and Good Clinical Practice protocols though, I’m sure those will be things you’ll need to be familiar with no matter where you work."
publichealth,"Already been on it. "
publichealth,"Also, the only thing I have on my resume that may be relatable in their eyes is I do bio-metric screenings as PRN. I think that’s the main reason they asked me for an interview. So idk if it really relates to a Clinical Research Project Coordinator job or not. "
publichealth,"It makes sense that these job titles mean different things to different people. There are many titles like that in (clinical) research. If they are looking for someone they can *train to be* a CRC, that's a different thing though. It's not rocket science, OP should be fine."
publichealth,"Show that you're incredibly passionate for clinical research. If you're having trouble finding experiences that relate to clinical research, and if they ask why you're interested, tell them. It also helps if you know some basic foundations regarding research, like ethics on human experimentation and such. "
publichealth,"I volunteered at a residential facility for Alzheimer's and Dementia. It was nothing at all like the nursing homes I volunteered at; even better. They made sure their residents exercised, and checked on them often to make sure they were alright. There were also a lot of activities available for the residents as well. "
publichealth,"That's perfectly fine, as long as you've got around a 3.5 GPA, a good GRE score, excellent letters of recommendation, and a wonderful personal statement. The MPH programs I know aren't that selective, but it helps to know that you're a good student in general.

Here are a list of programs you could look through: https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/public-health-rankings "
publichealth,"Absolutely not. We need people like you that not only knows how to care for the patients they're helping, but can also track down the diseases. 

But considering the level of work a nurse has to do, I think you should focus on nursing first, then go for your MPH in Epidemiology when you have time. But that's just my two cents. "
publichealth,Lol at this study. ONE year?
publichealth,"Well this stinks considering I work for a Workplace wellness program managing chronic conditions.  Since ER usage is down 37 percent for the last 3 years, I think we're doing pretty ok.  Hba1c is down 22% overall for diabetics..."
publichealth,Why? One year is a time where you could expect to find some benefits. It's not like it's some laughably short follow-up like 4 weeks.
publichealth,"This is generally true across most fields-a master's will get you jobs like ""research assistant"" or even manager. A PhD is usually needed to be a PI, although jobs like ""staff researcher"" and similar titles where you're not the PI but are more independent than an assistant may also require one (or not-that's less clear-cut)"
publichealth,"You're not wrong. I just watched a YT video where this guy said 2 years ago CROs would hire CRAs with zero experience as long as they have a degree in some science/health background, but now they want people to be a coordinator for at least a year before they can qualify for a CRA position."
publichealth,Following because I'm curious/know almost nothing about this route.
publichealth,Just turned in my policy memo about food insecurity in DC for a class. Wish i checked reddit before turning it in!

publichealth,"The BLS number is a mathematical average (statistical mean). So that number is accounting for all healthcare managers across the US, at all levels of responsibility and ranges of experience.

If a professional society puts out salary data, that would be a better place to look. These reports will break down by region, facility size (eg a small private practice versus a multi hospital system), and segment it based on years of experience (1-4, 5-10, etc)."
publichealth,"Just as an update:  I've heard back from 3 of the 4 schools that I applied to and have been accepted to them all! (San Jose State, Icahn School of Medicine, and UCLA)  Just waiting on UC Berkeley and to hear back regarding financial packages for each program.  Best of luck to everyone!"
publichealth,Reducing suffering is kinda cool
publichealth,"I really love whenever I delve into any social problem, I can find a public health lens to frame it in. It makes my brain feel more multi-disciplinary than it is!"
publichealth,"Looking at the big picture. In PH we are trying to improve the health of the entire community. I love looking at upstream prevention and how this can trickle down to have an impact on so many people and so many other things. 

Great question btw, I look forward to fellow PH nerd' s responses. "
publichealth,"I did research involving HIV and domestic abuse. After reading the statistics and the case studies, as well as the stories, I realized that there was more to medicine than just drugs or feeling better. There's a whole dimension to it that I didn't even consider. It's what inspired me to go into family medicine. "
publichealth,"PH is everywhere. It is easy to be passionate in your work and mold your career path to specific interests. "
publichealth,"I went to Niger, where there isn't ""public"" anything helpful. When you see what an effect it has, you can't help but feel passionate about it. "
publichealth,"I would really look at the impact of heart disease and stroke. I've seen mixed articles from public health organized blaming it on opioids or heart disease and obesity. "
publichealth,Obesity is the obvious one to me. The top causes of death in the US have obesity as a significant risk factor.
publichealth,"Sugar consumption isn't necessarily it. It's the general consumption of excess calories (commonly attributed to sugar consumption, as foods higher in sugar TEND to be void of nutrient density and full of empty (and higher) calories, I.E. soda) stemming from a few things; a lack of access and resources to nutrition education in schools primary through secondary and within communities, general misunderstanding of proper nutrition and bunk information full of misnomers, and a significant imbalance in the availability and cost proportion of convenience foods to higher quality, nutrient dense foods. Obesity Epi and ID Epi are my main interests."
publichealth,"I'm done with degrees, but always looking for certifications or other opportunities for professional development. It depends on what the job options are where you want to live. What would be marketable?  Shadow people whose job you are interested in and see if you like it. Find mentors.  Student debt is a tough mountain to climb! I wouldn't consider taking on more without some real life experience under my belt.  "
publichealth,"I agree with certs (I’ll also look into CHES) after I graduate, and debt is an important factor, but actually I already work full-time in public health! So I’m double-dipping in education and experience. "
publichealth,"I'm 4 years out from an MPH/RD and just applied to DrPH programs, which want you to be more mid-career so maybe something to keep in mind for down the road once you have a sharp focus on what you want to study."
publichealth,"I went PhD route because I'm more interested in evaluation and research. DrPH is an interesting degree because I think it means different things depending where you are. It's definitely more of a professional degree compared to a PhD. "
publichealth,"While I do agree food access is a concern, many assumptions you have made here are incorrect. Based on the current knowledge and consensus among metabolic researchers and endocrinologists, who have demonstrated repeatedly across species (the cell, murine models, monkeys, humans) that it is the type of calorie consumed and not the quantity that impacts insulin resistance, and therefore development of its related chronic conditions. I would be happy to provide the meta-analyses, RCT's, and books on the topic if you wish, although it'd be best to start with Gary Taubes and other researchers dedicated to debunking the ""energy imbalance"" hypothesis of weight gain. "
publichealth,I'll PM you for discussion rather than us have walls of text back and forth on your post.
publichealth,"I’m doing a PA/MPH, but I went into the dual from the start, so maybe I’m not a useful datapoint to you. Either way, it kinda depends on what you want to do with your skills. My choice was significantly determined by my interest in clinical medicine. "
publichealth,"I'm graduating this spring with a bachelors in health behavior science and a minor in public health. I hope to end up working in a public health department and I'm considering getting my masters degree in epidemiology. My professors suggested that I gain experience working as a Research Assistant until I pursue my masters degree. It'd be a great way to gain some experience and make connections.  "
publichealth,"Funny, I’m considering doing the reverse, a nursing degree but have already completed the MPH, also in Aus. Seems there are way more nursing gigs, have you tried looking at public health nursing jobs in health departments? "
publichealth,"I'm from the USA, my MPH w/o any medical experience didn't get me anywhere unfortunately.  Then I got that RN, and after 2 years experience the world opened up."
publichealth,I’m an MPH grad who is in her 3rd week of nursing school! In the US. How cool to know there are others like me! Everyone else in my program is 20 yrs old and working on their first degree.
publichealth,"This is great to hear. I got my MPH, then moved to a place where that degree didn’t get me very far. Getting my BSN now and hoping to be a PH nurse!"
publichealth,"If you don't mind me asking... I pretty strongly considered nursing school before deciding to get my MPH. I was wondering if anyone did MPH then nursing school. What do you do now? What were you doing/ where were you working before nursing school that made you decide to pursue it, and what kind of experience did you have to get for 2 years?"
publichealth,"I'm working community/public health nursing now.  So glad to be out of the hospital.  I run around helping educate patients and groups about modifiable health conditions.  I feel good at the end of the day, work from home mostly, and get paid pretty well. :)  I wanted to work for the CDC or FEMA, but without any medical experience it was hard to break in.  So now maybe in a couple years I'll have a better shot.  When I say 2 years experience, hospital nursing and psych.  Basically as an RN, nobody takes you seriously til you've been in the field for 2 years."
publichealth,Did you go to Tulane? Could I ask you a few questions about their MSPH in Industrial Hygiene?
publichealth,"I got my MPH in epi and now I work in a law firm. Play up your quant strengths and apply to ""data analyst"" positions in any field."
publichealth,That's kind of what I was thinking. Do you happen to have any insight into which industries might have more room for growth/etc? I don't want to feel stuck after a year lol
publichealth,"I didn't do the IH program, I did international health and development. Also I finished my MPH in 2001 so I may not know anything that matters anymore!"
publichealth,"Big Pharm has great paying jobs that are not always enormous CV stains. Also there are rounds of consultancy jobs that pop up through corporations like Lockheed-Martin and McKesson, they hire epi people on contract based on what grants they win."

publichealth,"Epi is often analytically rigorous and that statistical rigor can take you far. If you want to jump straight from an MS to $70k you might consider biostatistics. A good program and a deep understanding of theory and practice are valuable (if you can do it). "
publichealth,"I turned down Emory because I couldn't afford it, lol."
publichealth,This is a great post in general but my experience was that a lot of PhD students have master's degrees-especially in epi. I know my program does not take PhD applicants without one except in exceptional circumstances.
publichealth,I'd also like to add that the job I currently have (best paying in my cohort remember) is a bachelor's level research coordinator position. Just FYI.
publichealth,"Well, this is certainly a typical path, but that doesn't make it a good one. 

I'd also note that most people who want a PhD are research focused, so an M.S. is a reasonable first step...and those are far easier to get funded. An MPH is a terminal degree that gives students essentially 0 research experience and therefore prepares them quite poorly for PhD work. "
publichealth,"I didn't say it was a good one, BUT my experience is that a majority of programs do not accept students who do not have a master's. I think the MPH vs MS debate is mostly pointless-I actually switched from MS to MPH because I was able to finish it faster and save 10k, but if you're proactive you can tailor either to suit you.

I also think, while a PhD may make financial sense, only looking at the money is not the whole story-a PhD is HARD in a lot of unique ways. Honestly an MPH really...isn't....I mean it's kinda time consuming and definitely expensive, but PhD programs can be a whole new world of isolating and depressing. I do think it's good for people to look into their options but I also don't think it's fair to say ""this makes the most *financial* sense and therefore is the best option"" because that just isn't true-if it was, no one would take a paycut to leave a job that wasn't making them happy either."
publichealth,I don't disagree with any of this. I just thought it would make a good example to make my point...
publichealth,"Oh okay, then we're on the same page :) "
publichealth,"I have a few MPH grad friends in consulting. If you're seriously considering it, intern at one of the big firms this summer. If you still like it after that, look for jobs in consulting immediately after graduation (or before really). Consulting firms are notorious for not adequately valuing other types of experience, but also seem to be the last vestiges of significant on-the-job training so your best time to apply is right out of school."
publichealth,"I can't seem to get access to this article... What model did they use to show this? DiD? "
publichealth,Ok thanks! I meant US CDC not ECDC though :D
publichealth,"Damn. "
publichealth,"Hey! I also got into this program and I'm also super torn up about the cost. On the one hand, how could I turn down the #1 school? On the other hand, nearly $100,000 is insane!!!"
publichealth,"Well, congratulations! The good thing is decisions don't need to be made until April"
publichealth,Can you link to that post? I browsed this subreddit and didn't find it.
publichealth,Where did you end up going?
publichealth,do you think student consulting clubs count as good experience or are those only useful for scoring internships
publichealth,"Something to keep in mind: those without jobs are more vocal because they're looking and posting about looking.

That being said, you also have to look at the concentrations and job titles of people posting, because it can vary wildly. Public positions are wildly underfunded and most local or state jobs start in the 30-40K range, regardless of field. Geographic location matters, too -- the same title in New York City will pay differently than Indianapolis or a rural county.

Don't focus on the salary to start, be aggressive in your job hunt,  and focus on getting worthwhile experience during your degree and practicum/internship.

That being said, my MPH was in industrial hygiene (a subset of EOH at my school). I graduated in May 2015 with a job offer that started at 53K in a decent sized midwest city. I started applying to jobs in February 2015 and networked like crazy, following up on every referral (including the one that led to my job)."
publichealth,"So is a Bachelors in PH pretty much worthless, especially if you want to make 30k+ a year in Ohio? https://www.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/7okqlz/so_is_a_bachelors_in_ph_pretty_much_worthless/?st=JCAHD4UM&amp;sh=d94c54c6"
publichealth,"Pitt. Other than the weather I'm quite happy here, and I do love this city. Emory's program sounded amazing but not enough to spend twice+ the money on it-public health just isn't that lucrative."
publichealth,What are a list of some of the big firms prospective consultants should check out?
publichealth,"I don't think it makes any sense to get both degrees, especially if all that draws you to the social science courses is just curiousity or general interest.

If you want to work in public health, I'll tell you what a number of my mentors have told me...it's all about the hard skills. Taking classes in anthropology, etc is great but they're not really going to get you hired by themselves. Do your MPH in Epi, Biostatistics, Environmental Health, or Health Policy/Administration/Management. If Biostatistics or Epidemiology, focus on building your quantitative and qualitative data analysis skills, and build up a base of programs and methods that you can apply across the board. 

If you go to an accredited school, you'll likely take core classes in Behavioral/Social Science, and Global Health anyway. If you enjoy those, feel free to take more as electives. There may also be certificates you can complete concurrently that focus on the more social science aspect.

On a side note, you can also take some of the more social science types of classes for free online. They can give you a good introduction into the field and help you decide whether you want to work in a certain field."
publichealth,The latter.
publichealth,"I’m a soon-to-be MPH and what I’ve found is looking at specific concentrations under MPH yield better search results as well as higher salary. Find what you’re passionate about then go from there. "
publichealth,"The 60-70k is an eventual thing if you move up the ladder. But 40k is a common starting point. "
publichealth,"If you’re good at and enjoy public health statistics, get your degree in that. Any curriculum will have requirements to take classes outside of your focus, so you’ll have opportunity to study general public health classes and topics. 

Don’t need to get another degree for those. "
publichealth,"Deloitte, BCG, McKinsey, Huron, and Bain are the biggest in health care. I know current and former people from the first 3, all of which hire summer associates. Booz is also an option, but has a smaller health portfolio."
publichealth,"Depends where you go. In the public sector you really do have to put in your time. Don't expect a high salary right out of grad school without any real experience. But if you are looking for a higher salary, I find that local health departments tend to pay better compared to the state"
publichealth,"Thanks!! "
publichealth,crap
publichealth,"Industrial Hygiene is going to be the best bet for you if you are more focused on salary than the work you will be doing. (while i dont have an mph, i worked at Environmental protection for my state and started at 35k with a bachelors and 8yrs military experience, a coworker with an mph and 6yrs of xp was only making 46k but i live in a red state)."
publichealth,"But I'm not totally sure what a consulting club does. If you organize speakers and network, then no, that's not useful for getting a job. But if you take on paid clients as a group, then that would be useful."
publichealth,yeah i do independent small grants on my own (only pulled in 2 small jobs so far) and started up a consulting club that is trying to take on clients this year
publichealth,I don't think it would be worth it. Maybe go for an MPH in global health epidemiology (that's offered at GW I know) or another specialized major that incorporates all the things you're interested in. It would probably be smartest to choose a specialization that allows for many electives at a school that has representation from many subfields since you want a broader base.
publichealth,"Hey OP, I am part of a team that runs www.PHspot.ca. Although it was intially geared towards Canadian career development we started highlighting opportunities across the globe.

publichealth,"I graduated in 2016. Most of my classmates moved to large cities (Chicago, Denver, ect) and took salaries around 30-40k with 6-12 months being the typical time between beginning the search and getting hired. Most often people were taking positions in non-profits, city/county health departments, or case worker positions. 

Some of my classmates went back to school and some are still looking for a career position. The person who got the highest starting salary I'm aware of was ~70k. The description for the position was vague but it was some kind of consulting job. The person was driven and capable but to be honest I think they got the job because they have a family member working at the consulting agency already. Maybe I'm just salty about it and they really deserved it but it's not like they were setting the curve in their coursework or doing great research. YMMV"

publichealth,"My issue is that I really do want the hard statistics skills, mostly because it makes for a good backup if I don't want to work in PH down the road. I can easily transition to something else rather than feeling like I've only been trained to do one thing. It's easier to do epi with a background in stats than try to be a statistician with an epi background.

This is the issue I'm having with my undergrad degree and part of the reason why I want to go back to school."
publichealth,"&gt; Maybe I'm just salty about it and they really deserved it but it's not like they were setting the curve in their coursework or doing great research.

FWIW, once you cross the bar of being smart/qualified enough, people skills, willingness to work long hours, flexibility, and a high tolerance for bullshit (and sometimes verbal abuse) become vastly more important for consulting than another .1 GPA point. The highest paid person from my cohort also went into consulting and she was definitely in the lower half of the class academically, but she's still smart and willing to live in a hotel 4 days per week working 70+ hours and getting yelled at by clients who are way dumber than she is and kissing ass to people in her firm."
publichealth,"My issue is that I really do want the hard statistics skills, hence the MSc no MPH, mostly because it makes for a good backup if I don't want to work in PH down the road. I can easily transition to something else rather than feeling like I've only been trained to do one thing. This is the issue I'm having with my undergrad degree and part of the reason why I want to go back to school."
publichealth,"My biggest reason for wanting a MSc in stats is because I can't really get a job outside of what I'm doing now. I work in a quant field but I don't have a background in stats or any data experience.

I also don't plan on studying in the US, too expensive and I want international experience, so I definitely won't have a CEPH accredited degree. This is also why I want the MSc in statistics and not the MPH. 

I know myself too well to know that I'll never actually complete an online course unless my grades are at risk :/"
publichealth,"Like other posters said, location makes a big difference.  Also, experience matters.  I worked full time in the field while competing my MPH.  So I finished with 6 years experience plus an MPH. A job above entry level will require 3-5 years experience on top of a master's.  
"
publichealth,"I see. I assumed you were talking about a Biostatistics focus MPH and wanted other classes. 

Still, I think your plan is good. Statistics keeps public health running. Major in that and you can do whatever you desire. "
publichealth,"That's really good thinking. An MPH in biostatistics is probably the best option in that case. Certain broad-based courses are required for an MPH that will prepare for jobs across public health, but you'll also develop specific stats expertise."
publichealth,"I’m not sure what “hard statistics skills” you would be lacking with an MPH in biostatistics. I didn’t specialize in that, but statistics skills, programs and coursework are pretty similar no matter *why* you’re taking them. Doing linear regression analysis for public health isn’t really a different skill than doing linear regression analysis for other things. Plus, if you’re interested in the other social science and qualitative courses, the MPH will make you take a course in each of the main specialties of public health.

In any case, like other commenters have said, I think getting both degrees will not be useful to you. Find some schools you’d like to attend and compare their MPH in biostats to the MSc, and I’m willing to bet you’ll see a lot of overlap. At my school (Pitt), the difference is more of a career focus, whether you want to work in public health programs or doing research, so the end of the program may be a thesis versus a final project.

A key note about wanting a broader range of options is that MPH training is varied, so even if you specialize in biostatistics, you’ll still know about epi, microbiology, behavioral health, etc. It’s a flexible degree. Plus all of the specialties overlap. Health policy people need statistics. Behavioral health people need epi. The silos aren’t as separate as they seem.

Many schools also have alumni lists or helpful staff who can answer questions. Once you narrow down a few schools (find cities you’d like to work in and faculty whose projects sound interesting), go through the course requirements and see if you can find someone to answer questions about what each program is like.

The more information you gather, hopefully the easier your decision will be! Best of luck."
publichealth,"Adding to this, start looking to get a foot in the door while you’re at school. See if you can do an internship or a class project at a company/agency that appeals to you. Try do do a final project/thesis outside of the school. Talk to professors you like and see if they’re doing projects you can help with. Be an intern, a temp, a research assistant. You have some time left in the program and if you keep your ears open, you might be able to find some interesting opportunities that can segue into a job once you graduate. 

I also saw someone else mentioned it takes 6-12 months to find a job, and that was true for my class as well! Being out of school for 8 months without a job feels so disheartening, but it just takes some time. All of the classmates I keep in touch with are working in the field now, so don’t be discouraged! It takes some work and patience, but you’ll find something."
publichealth,"If I live in a city the size of 124,000 people what’s the likelihood Likelihood I could remain in my city? Or would I have to travel to somewhere like Atlanta?

And what are the chances that someone in health promotion and Behavior gets into consulting?"
publichealth,True
publichealth,"I should clarify that my MPH allowed me to be a final contender for the job without a ton of relevant experience so it helped me there, but if I had a decent B.S. and a little experience I could be in the same spot I'm in now with a lot less debt. 

In my position, the MPH was essentially a way for me to make up for a garbage B.S. (Kinesiology) that had no real career prospects outside of making $30,000/year to be a glorified personal trainer. The return on an MPH for someone in that position (assuming you go to a cheaper school than JH) isn't as bad because you don't get a do-over with your undergrad. If you were smart enough to have a marketable undergrad though, just go work and get experience, then look at more financially responsible avenues towards graduate education later. "
publichealth,"&gt; If I live in a city the size of 124,000 people what’s the likelihood Likelihood I could remain in my city?

Probably zero. Firms require their junior staff to live and be based out of one of their corporate offices and you have very little say as to where the clients you get are located and essentially no say on how often you are flown to their site. As you move up the ladder, you have more flexibility to choose your projects and you can request to be transferred to a different corporate office if you want to move, but you'll always have to live near one of the large airport hubs. Smaller, boutique firms allow much more flexibility, but their consultants are also very specialized, experienced (financially valuable) people who are often held accountable for bringing in their own clients so ignore that possibility for the first 10 years of your career.

&gt; And what are the chances that someone in health promotion and Behavior gets into consulting?

I have no idea what percentage of people in that major go into consulting nor do I know the chances of someone from that major getting hired so I'll just say that these firms hire *a lot* of people. They're all smart, but there are just really large hiring classes for the most junior positions. You can also easily get yourself fired in your first year by spending too much time without a client/contract. Your biggest risk with a degree that doesn't translate well to business/management is that you'll be brought on at a lower level than people with the same education level in a more financially valuable field."
publichealth,"I would be interested to talk with you more about the differing levels of difficulty between an MPH and a PhD since I only have the experience of completing one and have the notion that I'd like to complete the others. I want to make sure I've got solid expectations. 

I completely agree that my MPH was easy. I'm not sure how many of my cohorts would agree with that sentiment, but I do wholeheartedly. Especially with already having a public health undergrad, I felt like I just sailed right on through. "
publichealth,"Epi/Stats - Decent

Everything else - Crappy"
publichealth,"As someone with a public health BS and an MPH, I would argue that most public health degrees that are not leading into a research career are fairly worthless.

The idea of a ""terminal"" public health degree is somewhat archaic in my eyes. These degree programs were built to train people to go into work in government health departments. While there are still some positions available there, they are shrinking by the year, pay is terrible(try 42k a year for an MPH with 10 years experience who's the acting director of a public health division at the state level), and the outlook doesn't seem good. 

Maybe, MAYBE if you have an opioid specialty of some sort, you might be relevant. Also, epi/stats folks seem to be alright. Everyone else I know is in either a basement level crummy public health job, unemployed, or working in another field. 

I've met several leaders in public health organizations here in Indiana who have 0 public health academic experience. 

I don't recommend anyone go into this field unless they have a way to get a job in a hospital network or want to do research. "
publichealth,"Who in the world looks at their career trajectory with just an MPH and goes ""Looks good to me""? 

I figure everyone with an MPH was either on their way to Med school or a PhD, or underemployment. 

Source: Have MPH"
publichealth,"I don't personally have a PhD, so I might not give you the best perspective there-I am however the only one of my college friend group who has not yet landed in a PhD program so I've been the listening ear to a lot of the problems with a PhD in general (PH and not). If someone wants to talk about their PhD experience in public health though I am alll ears because it's probably in my future too.

I double majored in chem and sociology in undergrad and I kind feel like everything has been either quant skills I already had (or were being taught to a lower level than where I was) or sociology concepts that I had seen before, maybe wrapped a little different."
publichealth,"I swear epi/stats was never ever mentioned during anytime at my school. They taught us about this model called “preceded/proceed” and we learned about grant writing that’s it. Nothing was mentioned about researched jobs at all. They told us we can work in non profit like Red Cross or Peace Corps or work for a company doing Employee Health. Everything you typed above I don’t know a damn thing about. So did I just get a shit education? I literally don’t know a thing about stats. We didn’t learn about any kind of software/analytics program and yes I went to every class. There was an option where we could choose between AIDS and Epidemiology or Occupational Health and they counted as the same credit. I chose Occupational Health, where we mainly learned about OSHA and that’s it. 

How would I even get into finding a research/epi job and what would I have to research to stand even surviving in an interview?  BTW, heroin is HUGE where I live but my city is also majority of poverty and the people that do drug counseling make like 28-32k a year but you have to have a ton of certifications, stuff that wasn’t even brought up at my school. I actually applied for a job last July doing something with opioid use. One of the requirements was having this certain certification, but you can only get the certification if you yourself were a user or you lived a user for a certain amount of time. I didn’t qualify for either, so there goes that job position. Really the only thing that worked for me was getting a PRN job as a Biometric Screener, which school also didn’t teach me, but luckily it’s super easy. "
publichealth,"O ok, I thought you were speaking from PhD experience. "
publichealth,"Methods section;
 
Study Data And Methods

The analysis was limited to nonfederal, short-term, general and critical access hospitals in operation for at least one year in the period 2007–15. Critical access hospital is a designation given to rural hospitals by the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) that allows them to receive more generous cost-based reimbursement from Medicare, with the goal of promoting access to inpatient care in rural areas.

Hospitals in states that expanded childless adults’ eligibility for Medicaid after 2014 were excluded from the analysis, to eliminate potential bias from Medicaid expansions related to concerns about hospital finances.9 Our primary specifications exclude a 2013–14 “washout” period that reflects the time period when enrollment related to the expansion was increasing but had not yet reached its full impact on uninsurance rates.10 In addition, hospital data are reported by fiscal year, which often is different from calendar year. State-level Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) income eligibility limits were collected for four income-based eligibility categories: adults with dependent children, childless adults, children (including those eligible for CHIP), and pregnant women.
Hospital Data

We used the CMS Provider of Services file to identify potential hospital closures in the period 2008–16, based on Medicare provider IDs that were no longer operating because of either closure or merger/acquisition. From this set of hospitals, we verified actual hospital closures, defined as hospitals’ ceasing to deliver short-term general hospital services, from multiple sources.11

Hospital financial outcomes were computed using CMS’s Healthcare Provider Cost Reporting Information System reports. Total margin is defined as total income divided by revenue; operating margin is net patient income divided by net patient revenue; and Medicaid and uncompensated care margin is defined using net income related to treatment of Medicaid and uninsured patients divided by the net revenue from treating these patients. Information about the latter became available for all hospitals beginning in 2011. This margin was included because it directly measures the financial benefit to hospitals when patients switch from no insurance to Medicaid. Net revenue included payments received from state and local governments’ indigent care programs and Medicaid but did not include disproportionate-share hospital (DSH) payments, because reliable data were not available at the hospital level. Revenues and expenses related to CHIP were not included in the calculation because these were unrelated to the ACA Medicaid expansion. The financial variables were trimmed at the first and ninety-ninth percentiles of the original distribution to prevent unrealistically large outliers from biasing our results.

Data on hospital ownership, teaching status, bed size (numbers of beds), critical access hospital status, rural location, and numbers of profitable and unprofitable services were drawn from the Healthcare Provider Cost Reporting Information System and the Provider of Services files. Profitable services included open heart surgery, cardiac catheterizations, chemotherapy, neurosurgery, and obstetrics. Unprofitable services included alcohol and drug services, burn care units, and psychiatric services (inpatient, outpatient, child and adolescent, and emergency).12 Following previous literature, we defined a hospital as rural if it was in an area with a Rural-Urban Commuting Area code greater than 4 or if it was designated as a critical access hospital.8 Fiscal years that overlapped two calendar years were assigned to the calendar year that represented the majority of days within the fiscal year.

We calculated a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to measure the competitiveness of local markets, defined using 2007 hospital referral regions.13 County-level per capita income and rates of uninsurance and unemployment were obtained from the Census Bureau.
Statistical Methods

We computed the mean level and pre- and postexpansion change over time of all outcomes and covariates in expansion and nonexpansion states. We tested the significance of changes over time and the difference between the changes in expansion and nonexpansion states.

The association of ACA Medicaid expansions and the outcomes was estimated using a difference-in-differences specification. The specification included a dichotomous variable that equaled 1 if the hospital was in a state that expanded Medicaid in 2014 and 0 otherwise. A post variable that equaled 1 during the postexpansion period was interacted with the expansion state variable to measure the change in the outcome in expansion states relative to change in nonexpansion states. In other words, we estimated the difference between pre- and postexpansion changes in the outcomes experienced by hospital in expansion and nonexpansion states.

Outcomes were modeled as a function of hospital and market characteristics and the state Medicaid federal poverty level eligibility limits for children, parents, and pregnant women. We controlled for changes in eligibility for these categories, to isolate the impact of the ACA’s expansion of eligibility for childless adults. We modeled the probability of closure as a function of previous-year covariates to take into account the timing of the closure decision, which is generally made before the actual closure. In addition, the data were incomplete in the year of the closure, because the hospital was not in operation the entire year. The hospital closure model was estimated using logistic regression. The analyses of financial outcomes included hospital and year fixed effects, and the analysis of closures included year fixed effects. We performed sensitivity analyses of the closure models by estimating specifications that included the washout period (2013–14), included states that expanded Medicaid in 2015 or 2016, excluded states that expanded Medicaid before 2014,14 or included state random effects. We also estimated linear probability models that included either state fixed effects or random effects.

We also estimated a specification with actual Medicaid poverty-related eligibility levels for childless adults in place of the interaction between the “Post” period and “Expansion State” status (denoted as Post*Expansion State hereafter). This specification directly measured the association of childless adult eligibility levels with the probability of hospital closure.

We tested whether the association between Medicaid expansion and the outcomes varied depending on local uninsurance rates for adults measured in the period before expansion. This specification tested our hypothesis that hospitals in expansion states would experience substitution of uninsured patients for Medicaid patients. If this substitution was driving our results, the association of the expansion and each outcome would become stronger as the preexpansion rate of uninsurance increased. This was tested by adding pre-2014 local adult uninsurance rates to the specification and interacting it with the Expansion State, Post, and Post*Expansion State variables. We reported the percentage change in the probability of closure calculated with the marginal effect of the Post*Expansion State variable evaluated at local uninsurance rates ranging from 0 percent to 30 percent. All standard errors were clustered by state. To avoid the known problems of interaction terms in logistic models, we report the percentage change in the probability of closure that was calculated as the marginal effect divided by the closure probability.15

The difference-in-differences results had a causal interpretation if a number of assumptions were satisfied.16 Most importantly, the decision to expand Medicaid must be exogenous (that is, not confounded). This would hold true if states decided to expand Medicaid without considering hospitals’ financial performance or viability. Hospitals in all states must be subject to “common shocks”—which implies that we needed to control for all relevant time-varying differences between hospital markets in expansion and nonexpansion states. For example, we included median income and unemployment rates to control for differences in the local economy, and Medicaid eligibility levels for childless adults, children, and pregnant women to control for changes in poverty-related eligibility levels experienced in expansion and nonexpansion states during the study period. Finally, hospitals in nonexpansion states should be representative of hospitals in expansion states, to provide an estimate of what would have occurred if Medicaid had not been expanded.

We performed tests of preexpansion parallel trends in expansion and nonexpansion states to test the validity of our assumptions. In the closure specification we also tested whether the adjusted mean probability of the closure in the pre-expansion period was the same in expansion and nonexpansion states because we estimated a nonlinear model. Finally, we tested whether the change in the covariates from the pre- to the post-expansion period was the same in expansion and nonexpansion states.

All analyses were conducted using Stata, version 14.2. This study was deemed exempt from review by an Inter-Institutional Review Board."
publichealth,"Nah I'm speaking from being nosy and a good listener! I think a lot of the things about a PhD that are hard are independent of field, though."
publichealth,"Well, my understanding is than any accredited MPH program requires graduate level work in Biostatistics and Epidemiology so...yes it's possible that you've received a degree from a non-accredited school or a non-accredited program. That would be double bad. Don't just take my word on that though, do some looking. 

Also, don't get too worked up over being sold a faulty bill of goods regarding your employment prospects, it happened to all of us. Faculty members in these programs often held precisely the jobs they think they are training us for, but that no longer exist, or have morphed into something different. 

You are unlikely to find a research job without research experience, and I will promise you you won't get an epi job without an epi focus or at least completion of some epi coursework. 

Your example of the counselors is a typical public health employment situation right now. Lots of credentials and education, little pay. 

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I have seen too much sugar coating and back patting around here and my goal is to inject some reality. That being said, I am young, freshly out of the program, and basing my opinions on my experiences in job hunting, and that of my cohorts. More experienced professionals may be aware of opportunities I don't see, but again, it might have been a while since they were job hunting. It's rough. "
publichealth,"I'm secretly hoping it's like everything else that people SAY is hard, and be actually not that difficult. 

I remember people telling me college was hard, it wasn't. I remember people telling me an MPH was hard, it wasn't. Idk, maybe just not being a chronic binge drinker is sufficient to ease the academic difficulties expressed by the masses. Haha"
publichealth,"Yeah I've never found actual academics hard...paying for them, and paying rent, that's another story..."
publichealth,"Well I reached out to a lot of people on LinkedIn from my school’s alumni with the same degree. Most didn’t have jobs in the field or worked in some kind of exercise program which I’m not into anymore. One guy I spoke to does a lot state wide in Ohio’s Health Departments and he told me the teachers at my school don’t know anything about the job environment of this field today, and they are going on education that’s 40 years of date. I hope that’s not true because I feel I just wasted 50k on nothing for the hope of a brighter future finding a job to get me out of this heroin/poverty stricken town.  I remember we watched some video on Public Health and they said the job market for a field would grow by 70% by 2019 (this was in 2015) and it seems like its shrinking now because no one wants to fund jobs for Public Health. 

Based on what you know, is there any types you think I could apply for out the field that would take a look at me for having a bachelor’s in general? I know there are tons of jobs that would hire for like a management position I hear, but I don’t know what to look for. Really the only thing I care about is just making like 40k or working to 40k in a few years so I can grow up and have a family and just try my best to live a normal life like anyone else. I don’t feel like going back to school to do something else. I just want to work and be a normal 26 year old and enjoy life the little I can. That’s all I want at the end of the day. Moving is out of the question for right now. "
publichealth,"Well, I'd just say that I tend to agree with the man you spoke with wholeheartedly. 

Regarding the expansion of the job market, you'll often hear things like ""The need for public health will expand"", which is more of a political statement than an economic one. The need for public health SERVICES will expand, but that doesn't indicate that public health practitioners will be the ones to provide said services. More and more of this is being taken over by insurance companies, hospital networks, and private corporations. 

Think about Obesity/Diabetes/Heart Disease. Type 2 diabetes costs over 1 Billion dollars a DAY to treat right now in the US, so we in the field all think there will be a breaking point where we actually start funding prevention programs...but alas, so far...not so much. 

If you're willing to sell your soul a little, you would probably get a decent job with a major health insurer. If you are lucky enough to land in either a hospital network, or a university, count your blessings (I'm in this camp), private companies have a poor record of hiring actual credentialed professionals because they're simply too expensive. Far easier to pay peanuts for some jackass with a weekend personal training certification to do the implementation of your programs. 

Are you graduated?

I'd hang tight in your current position because the comp is honestly pretty good for the field and for only having undergraduate education. Do you work for an employer with education benefits? If so, consider further credentials in a slightly different direction (I'm not saying jump ship, but maybe look at nursing or some more clinical profession that is more solid). 

Management of what? A Starbucks? You have an undergraduate education and no management experience (I presume). Who would hire you to manage anything? No offense of course, they shouldn't hire me to manage anything either. 

Honestly, if all you care about is 40k, then just stay put. I highly doubt that will last though. You'll want to develop and challenge yourself, and that will take some type of shift. 

Best of luck. 
"
publichealth,Preach brother! haha
publichealth,"I actually work for a hospital and a company called Interactive Health (they do Biometric screenings for insurance companies) but the jobs are PRN and hours aren’t guaranteed. I haven’t worked with them since the first week of Dec. but we have a lot of jobs coming up from Feb-April. 

My hospital network doesn’t know where they could fit me in their network except maybe employee health but they hardly have positions open. I’ve spoken to/got the run around from 8 different people with my hospital network that didn’t even know what my degree was. So I don’t know the kind of work I should look for at a hospital. The education assistance they offer is with their own Kettering College, which is mainly just nursing stuff. 

As far as management stuff, I’ve just heard some companies are looking to hire managers for restaurant chains with zero experience, all they care is you went to college and have a degree. How true that is, idk, that’s just what I’ve been told by a handful of people. "
publichealth,"What is your degree specifically?

The resturant management thing is likely true. If you can show up to class for 4 years they figure you can manage a Wendy's. I would imagine though that if you went into this field for any reason at all...you'll be miserable doing that. "
publichealth,"I also have a BS in Kinesiology and really don't appreciate that you call it ""garbage."" I absolutely loved my degree path and you really shouldn't say that about any degree tbh. I was able to obtain a highly competitive position based off the experiences that I had acquired through my kinesiology degree (1 position for over 200 applicants, including individuals holding graduate degrees). Any degree is marketable with the right time and effort. All I'm saying is to please be more considerate with your comments . "
publichealth,"So my degree is an odd situation. I started in school in August 2010. It was called Health Promotion and that’s what my degree says. I graduated in May of 2017 and August of 2016 they changed it to Public Health for anyone starting that year. We had to take 6 extra classes in order to get our degree to say Public Health which I didn’t feel like doing because I was sick of school and just wanted to graduate and work on “being a mature adult”. The career development workers said it’s the same exact same thing and just tell employers it’s a Public Health degree. 

So this is what they offer now. Only a couple things are things they added on that I didn’t learn about, mainly the bottom part of the page is all new info to me. Everything we learned was that Precede/Proceed thing if you even know what that is. 

https://miamioh.edu/academics/majors-minors/majors/public-health.html"
publichealth,"Forgive me for going off on accreditation earlier. I didn't learn about epi/stats much in undergrad either. I thought we were talking about an MPH for a moment. 

Honestly, with a health promotion degree, just bark up the tree of local health departments and any health based non-profit around and hope to land a very low level position with them for $32,000/year. From there, build a plan, adjust course, and get your career going. "
publichealth,"I am sorry that you were not pleased with my descriptive comments, but I won't be retracting them or altering course anytime soon. 

I am pleased to hear that you were able to obtain proper employment, but would you like to know who the number 1 employer is of the Kinesiology graduates in my cohort? The Marriott hotel....I graduated from a fully accredited and well respected state university. The program was not a negative outlier. 

Now, you and I, and some others have managed to do well with Kinesiology degrees, but I would argue that we are in a small minority. My success is somewhat in spite of my degree, and not because of it. 

Are there things I am very grateful for from my undergraduate education? You bet! For one, I have a very nice side job as a well paid personal trainer because I have much more experience and credentials than other trainers in the area. Second, I have a much greater understanding of my own body, body positioning, posture, etc that has greatly reduced my likelihood for injury in life. That's awesome!

I am not saying that the information one learns in a Kinesiology program is without value. I am saying that economically speaking, to invest 4 years of time, plus the varying cost for tuition, fees, books, living expenses, etc to work at the Marriott makes it ""garbage"" in the marketplace for most people. "
publichealth,"Geez man, you have no idea how hard I’ve been trying. I’ve actually reached out to 4 different people on LinkedIn that work at Health Departments and came to their work to just see the department and meet the people. They hardly ever have positions open pretty much because almost people there work to retirement because the benefits are so good I guess. Trust me, I browse a lot of different county’s websites and follow Ohio SOPHE job listings. A lot of jobs want a RN or 10-15 years experience with a bachelor’s or 5 years experience with a Master’s that’s not a Health Department job. That seems to be 90% of the jobs I see listed. 

You mentioned hospital jobs. What jobs should I look out for in a hospital related to my degree? "
publichealth,"Trust me, I get it. I stumbled with blind luck into my position after 6 months of unemployment following my Master's graduation. Most of these jobs aren't posted, or if they are, they're posted only on an organizations website and are snatched up quickly because the supply is high. 

The nature of supply and demand is hard at work in our field. The supply of public health practitioners is high, and demand is low, so places can demand 10-15 years experience for jobs that pay $42,000 because there is someone with that experience that will take it. It's sad. 

Honestly, having not worked in a hospital, I have no idea. Some have community health outreach programs that you might be able to get into. "
publichealth,"Seconded. 40k is extremely common. I'm still in my first year of my MPH program, but I work in public health and make $40500 (in an expensive city). You've just got to get that experience in the beginning. "
publichealth,"The FDA (a public health organization) hires professionals (like veterinarians) as investigators to inspect facilities (food, dog food, veterinary drugs) to make sure they're producing safe product. They also assist in outbreak situations that result from adulterated product. I am in the process of getting my MPH and work in the same capacity but with medical devices. Other countries have similar regulatory agencies, if you're wanting to leave the country. With your Peace Corp stuff, you'd get priority points on federal job apps. It's a real steady job, because 70% of the US's distributed product is regulated by the agency, and there's a good amount of promotion potential. "
publichealth,"It's rough especially for EHS concentration. If you want to excel in this field, you'll very likely have to bite the bullet and get an entry level safety job in manufacturing, food processing, or aerospace for a few years. Even for government EHS jobs, you'll need experiences and pass license exams ($500+) to be considered a trainee. There is a high barrier to entry. I will tell you that once you hit 5-10 years of experience, you'll have access to consulting and big salary numbers &gt;70k.  "
publichealth,"You can still work in public health as a veterinarian. My agency has a dedicated Veterinary Public Health program. They handle stuff like epizootics with zoonotic risk, vector-borne diseases, rabies risks, animal importation and quarantine. There's a lot of room for cooperative projects with communicable disease, environmental health, and agriculture. Sure, a few epidemiology/epizoology courses might come in handy, but I don't think you need to do a full 2 year masters. One year at most since you have the DVM."
publichealth,"Take this with a grain of salt as I’m only about two years out of undergrad for microbiology, but your interests are exactly in line with mine as a public health hopeful (although I’m disinclined to become a vet). I currently work in a veterinary public health lab that deals with clinical diagnostic testing along with broader epidemiological surveillance for known zoonoses, from Anthrax to Zika. All of the department heads here are veterinarians (maybe a handful have a PhD alone instead) although we are joined at the hip with UC Davis School of Vet Med, so there’s a lot of joint work going on. 

Point being: there is absolutely a place in the world right now for you as a veterinarian in public health, without necessarily needing further education or certification. As others mentioned, FDA and USDA absolutely need and hire vets for disease testing and surveillance, and other equivalent state-level agencies do the same. That being said, if you’re interested (like me!) in one health and might want to study in Europe, you might consider the MSc in One Health—Infectious Diseases at the Royal Veterinary College in London, among other degree options. It won’t be exactly the same as an MPH and I don’t know how easily one can get certified as a public health scientist with that particular degree, but I imagine it could reinforce both your existing skills and build on your interests into something others would be even more inclined to hire you for. "
publichealth,"...I think everyone who looked at it reached the same conclusion as you, except the only difference is that you are reacting the way you are to a simple:

&gt;Relax, the study is just what it is.

I am curious at this point if you and your friends gave any thought to those metrics before trashing them. You would have a ground to stand on if the study's authors attempted to overstate their claims, but surprisingly nobody did. So just calm down champ, the only person getting defensive is you, it's preliminary results from a multi-year study, all they pretty much stated was that year one was largely inconsequential."
publichealth,"Just some backstory: My husband sent this to me and I thought it was a joke. Just seems really cheesy and poorly worded to me. I looked it up and it actually went through some community feedback sessions, which kind of surprised me. "
publichealth,"I thought public health has gotten off the ""weed is bad"" bandwagon. "
publichealth,"It's weird they did weed over alcohol or harder drugs (and why is it in JUST English?), but tbh I don't know the health issues there to know if that is a priority health concern in the area or not. "
publichealth,"""Hispanics"" is not really the correct term. ""Latinos"" is what they should have used. The former refers to those of decent from Spain or those who are Spanish-speaking, and the latter refers to those from Latin America. Moreover, while I get the sense they were going for community and cultural pride, it is a bit off putting. This is especially true since close community or familial ties are Latino stereotypes and make it seem as though Latinos can only be seen as (and with other) Latinos.
"
publichealth,Lol
publichealth,It largely has. This is likely just local politics at play.
publichealth,"I guess my question is, who at the DOH approved this, since state DOHs usually don't take this stance. Or better yet, who in their PR office for paid off (kidding, not a conspiracist)"
publichealth,"While public health has generally gotten away from ""weed is bad"", and in fact often times support some of the benefits that marijuana can provide in the right contexts, this looks more like they are targeting teens not adults. Public health is still generally against teens using marijuana recreationally.

EDIT: It looks like targeting teens both because of the faces as well as the campaign website: www.listen2yourselfie.org"
publichealth,"They don’t seem to know how to connect with their audience. "
publichealth,"The only reason I’m getting defensive is because some stranger on the internet is being annoying and condescending because I don’t like how this study chose their measurement variables and I think it was reported irresponsibly. Are public health professionals not responsible for proper communication about their results any more? Relax buddy, sometimes people don’t like things you do. Welcome to the internet. "
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"I sorta want to get into Public Policy as well. I assume you need Law School or something to get into it? I have zero experience other than BS in Public Health so idk where to start. "
publichealth,"I thought the interview went really well. Only downside was they kept saying “we are more behind the scenes” where “your jobs have always been patient care” so idk if that holds me back or not in their eyes. I interviewed with 3 people and I read the Glassdoor interview reviews for this place and I was dreading it from the interview reviews but it wasn’t bad at all.

publichealth,Makes sense enough. I guess I'm just confused still as to why this is a campaign. There are tons of public health concerns for teens that I would rank higher in priority than this. I guess this is why I work in surveillance and not BSHE
publichealth,"Unless something radical has happened to kids since I was one, this billboard will seem even more awkward to them."

publichealth,"Our program is ineffective, IMHO. No support for non-vehicle transit. No onsite facilities. No flexibility to use outside facilities.

In fact, it's laughable to call it a wellness program. But I do complete a large annoying survey every year to save a few bucks. Or avoid paying extra; can't remember how they do it."
publichealth,I'm sure this isn't the only campaign targeting teens they have. Just one that gets the most attention online.

publichealth,"I agree! Also, knowing how calculus is used in statistics is also very important as well. There are some calculus based statistics courses that do just that. These aren't offered at every university, however."
publichealth,"Firstly, no condescension intended, but based on what you actually wrote it still seems like you did not read the actual study in question. Secondly, the results they published and the media article itself did not overstate any thing. Lastly, you want to call out others about being responsible with their analysis and communication but get upset when someone essentially calls you out on the same behavior? Relax buddy, your reaction is beginning to seem more and more like you were caught puffing your chest because I happen to disagree with your assessment and asked you to back it up.

I have never seen someone in this field get so upset over a simple reminder that this is a preliminary report at one year for a multi year study, nothing more or less. You can't even draw anything meaningful from that. Hell, even the Reddit title was on point. The interview goes through that even. So relax, nobody said that wellness programs did not work, and I am not entirely sure the measure is designed to address that. So calm down and if you want to continue, quit talking past the actual points beyond some perceived slight from internet strangers (like you suggested)."
publichealth,"Are you at a hospital affiliated with a university? The one I'm at allows 4 units of study per semester free as long as you're a full time university employee. If this is an option, take a few grad-level public health and public policy courses. You might even be able to get away with taking the courses outside of a degree program. No certificate, but relevant coursework still applies."
publichealth,"Also, did you see this link for free courses in PH law? https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/phlacademy.html"
publichealth,"I was in the same boat as you, with limited public health background and got accepted into 4 great MPH schools. 

My 5 steps:

1) I sat down with everyone who was going to write me a recommendation and really hammered why I wanted to go into public health despite my bad grades. They were able to speak on my personal setbacks as a phase and how I’m a dedicated individual. 

2) My essays all talked about my personal growth and how it’s developed into a passion for public health and my interests in PH. 

3) studied my butt off for GREs and did well. 

4) applied to tons of schools. 

5) i did a lot of community service and part time work related to public health when I started to apply to emphasize I was driven. I did volunteer a lot in college so this may have helped as well.

publichealth,"That sounds pretty awesome! How did you find this, just a google search on veterinary epidemiology? I still have another 18 months in the peace corps, but afterward this is definitely the kind of thing I would love to apply for!"
publichealth,"I built data collection tools and a database for an international research project. I spent a month or so in the US, and 2.5-3 months abroad working on the project. I also spent time training field staff on data collection and entry. Our requirement was also approximately 200-300 hours, but almost all of us put in 400+ hours. Probably more if we were abroad.

My recommendation is to identify the types of data analysis you would like to work on, and the types of skills you'd like to learn or build upon. Then reach out to professors at your school who have matching interests. Most practicums are unpaid, so people are usually willing to take on a student for a few months over the summer. Other organizations to reach out to would be local departments of health (depending on where you are). 

Just make sure whoever you work with, that you have a clear understanding that you're not there to do basic filing and administrative work (something any high school student could do)."
publichealth,"I did mine through the state health department. I reached out to their email and was connected with people in the department with similar interests to me. 

I built a system to track outbreaks of Influenza Like Illnesses in skilled nursing facilities across the state. I also assisted my preceptor in her influenza analysis since it was peak flu season and she was getting inundated with data. 

If there is a particular area that you are interested in I recommend looking at local or state health department websites to try to find someone who's interests align with yours because they can best help you do what you want and can guide your project and your experience in a positive manner. I also found with mine being in a larger health department setting was beneficial because if I hit a stall in my project (like when SAS was being dumb and didn't want to run my code) there were plenty of other surveillance projects that they were happy to let me help with so I was able to get a very well rounded educational experience out of my time. "
publichealth,I would focus more on spread sheets and becoming an excel wizard. Being able to generate reports and manipulate data in a way management can understand will make you really valuable.
publichealth,"It depends what route you want to take post MPH.. 

Data Science is a big thing and can be very valuable for Epi-careers depending where you want to end up. So CS courses especially with Python can be useful.  "
publichealth,"I ended up on a grant funded project working with one of my profs to analyze survey data for a nonprofit that supports farmworker health. I suggest you either contact your city's health department or VA hospital and see if they have projects available that interest you, or if any of your profs have an ongoing project that interests you, ask if you can get involved! "
publichealth,"R has some good Epi packages.

publichealth,Either live in a blue state or go global. I had a job throughout my program and do alright now. 50% salary increase since starting and finishing my program.
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,Are you me?
publichealth,"I agree, I'm hopefully going to be providing data to the CS department of a local university in order to help them use health related data to inform the public. Epi doesn't always realize that it needs people who can work with this type of data but they are coming around. We are anyway! And the opportunities for hypothesis generation or simply increased efficiency are really overwhelming. "
publichealth,"What? Thats terrible advice, anyone competent who works with lots of data is not going to be using excel for data management. It would be way more beneficial to learn programming skills along with R and/or SAS depending on what people you want to work for use. Even just having basic skills in programming can make you way more valuable worker and generally says that you can do whatever is needed, including excel if necessary. Just having excel skills doesn't mean much. Not to mention that you can generally accomplish things way more efficiently, faster and better in programs other than excel when working with data. "
publichealth,That's probably true in the private sector but in government (especially county level public health and state DOH agencies) those types of programs are not as widely used due to budgetary constraints. Excel is still the data organization tool in public health agencies across the country.
publichealth,"Currently doing an online BA in health. Program materials vary from course to course, but in general: textbook readings; article readings; online quizzes; papers/projects to hand in; that kind of thing.

So far one prof has posted some (not all) content enhanced with video lecture; it definitely made for a better experience and made me feel more connected to the content, but was the exception rather than the norm."
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,"Mmmmm, all that tasty tasty data..."
publichealth,"This is a shame.  I mean it's understandble since it was emergency funding, but hopefully they can renew it."
publichealth,"Thanks, I wasn't aware of this, I'll check it out. I haven't really thought to the extent of policy yet. I'm still focusing on making the transition to clinical studies, I was thinking I would spend 5-10 years making myself an expert at it, then do the switch to policy. I would probably be wiser then hah. Also, yes, my hospital is affiliated with a university and I can take 6 credits a semester. Starting with a grad level statistics class, but man, it's hard to do that and work! Trying though."
publichealth,"It depends on what level of public policy you want to enter in. I wanted to be in a place to influence policy decisions, and so I thought I would have to get way more experience in the field and learn the contributing variables to decision-making. If you want to understand the healthcare aspect of PH, I would suggest you start by interning at places that do clinical studies. Going the law way would get you right into the thicket of politics, and if that is your goal, that would definitely be the way to go."

Even though this year's vaccination is not very effective, health officials say it still offers some protection. And they say it's still not too late to get vaccinated.

I hope everyone who can gets vaccinated, if only to protect others. I have to, because I work in a hospital.

Public health seems to be so vague and diverse, while the honours degree only takes you down RA avenues, which while having a few years experience in, is either glorified ad hoc work, or mind numbing and repetitive.

I would recommend networking within your school and finding an academic/mentor whose work appeals to you. Often when you build a relationship with senior investigators and you can demonstrate your competence, work generally follows. That would be my advice.

publichealth,I think it's a decent marker in the US in that most solid programs are accredited. But yeah beyond that....eh.
publichealth,"I am American and am doing my MPH in Germany. One problem I have run into is that the European CDC has great internship opportunities... but only for EU citizens. The American CDC also has great opportunities... if you studied at a CEPH-accredited school. Luckily, there are lots of other opportunities in Germany and throughout Europe and they are not concerned with a CEPH accreditaiton"
publichealth,"There are also English programs in Germany, check out Heidelberg, HAW Hamburg or Charite Berlin. I believe some of these programs can be done extra-occupational. You should check how much you are able to earn on a student visa in all the countries you are looking it. In Germany, for example you are not allowed to earn more than 450 Euro per month on a student visa. Because I also had/have to work, I found a job first, got a work visa, and then enrolled in an MPH program that meets only on weekends. My program has been very manageable and I am very happy with it  "
publichealth,"I agree with this! I found my ""mentor"" this way, just sent her an email and now we are working together on my thesis, I got sent to a conference, she is great. Just show interest and willingness to learn, you will find someone "
publichealth,"Don't underestimate the cost of living in Norway. Even though the tuition is free, you will spend at least double the amount on living costs than you would in Hamburg (I currently live here). You can live in a student accommodation for as low as 300 Euro per month and food in Germany is cheap. As a student in Germany you can also earn up to 450 EURO a month untaxed and there are lots of under the table opportunities (babysitting, English tutoring) in the Hamburg expat community where you can make even more money.

Rankings in Germany are not important, your grades and internships are. Thre are also scholarships that you might want to consider looking at : DAAD study scholarship, and Bayer Carl-Duisberg International Fellowship, for example "
publichealth,"Which program in Germany? "
publichealth,"One year is very short in terms of total program implementation. 

Edit: think about how long it takes to influence behavior change. People who are not already working out or making healthy behavior changes are on a spectrum of ready to change —&gt; unwilling to change, and take time. Not to mention how long it takes for actual health benefits to manifest. "
publichealth,"From your post you sound like you are really motivated by public health, and don't seem to care too much for wealth. If you do an MPH, do consider working abroad in a third world country. There will be plenty of opportunities within NGOs. Your quality of life might not be excellent, but you might find satisfaction."
publichealth,"I have my MPH and have worked up to management over my 12 years.  Two years ago I decided to add the RN.  My public health areas are infection control and occupational safety.  I have a great career without the RN, but have already seen some great benefits to this combo.

 I manage multiple clinics so it gave me street credit with my employees and has been great to step in and take patients when someone calls off from a shift.  I also feel less intimidated in dealing with physicians and nurses who are often our clients or are to whom I must defend my policy decisions.

I added RN despite already knowing floor nurse isn't my thing from a few years as an EMT.  I got the 1-year LPN and enrolled into an RN bridge program right after.  I stayed with my previous role, but get an added 10% on my salary.

The clinical background is an edge, and many interesting jobs I see either prefer or require a clinical license.  It should help strengthen my chances if a big layoff since I can cover both Manager and RN role.  Plus, some of my more adventurous friends with RN/MPH have very cool jobs that involve flying off to outbreaks and other versions of saving the world.

I am very lucky to have such a supportive employer, both in pay and flexible schedule.  Even still, doing clinical rotation shifts on top of work and class almost killed me.  I think you'll find doing the MPH much easier to do if you're still working.

One last thought...  In the US there is a push for NP/MPH.  These act as primary care, rural care, and urgent care.  I have one as the clinical lead over all 30 of my department RN staff and she makes good money.  It's more work for sure to add the NP, but good to know there is still another angle if the first plan dries up.   "
publichealth,"Relax, the study is just what it is."
publichealth,"Thanks for your insight? It’s an NIH-funded study. "

is the conference held in your area?"
publichealth,"The MPH is considered a terminal degree for the field, and so in most instances, the PhD is not required. If you're interested in a career in academia—whether it be research, teaching, or even on the admin side—you will need a PhD. 

You could also just start the MPH and see how you feel about pursuing your PhD—you'll obtain a masters on the way to PhD, and so why not make it the MPH??"
publichealth,"Any foundations do this? I'd listen to BMG or similar. "
publichealth,"Hope you know regressions, decision trees, ect down pat. Welcome to data science."

publichealth,Or try r/epidemiology
publichealth,"There is a section on student Doctor network for MPH students. There is a yearly thread where students post basically their entire application. Gpa, GRE, research, volunteer work, work experiences, the schools they applied to, the whole nine yards. They will update their comments in the thread to say which schools they got accepted to. So from this you can get a good idea of what applications can get into which schools. I believe the thread is called “What are my chances” or something similar and it’s most likely stickied. Hope this helps "
publichealth,"Do you think an engineer with a few years of site work experience not related to EHS, specifically mining, will have advantages when looking for jobs? I'm in the process of completing my MPH and I'm looking to switch out of engineering (long story). "
publichealth,You’re welcome! :)
publichealth,"Honestly if you aren't planning on looking internationally there is like 5 amazing schools and the rest are all good. But some of those specific programs you want are very unique so if a school has exactly that you want just go there . Public health isn't really the type of degree where it matters where it came from (as long as school is accredited ) and if you plan on working in private health related consulting then school does matter of course "
publichealth,"Feel like it's worth adding that Congress and the current administration have really had their sights on putting the public student loan forgiveness program on the [chopping block](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/12/11/house-gop-higher-education-overhaul-would-cap-graduate-lending-and-end-loan), so I wouldn't count on it if it's a dealbreaker for you."
publichealth,"We'll have to see how it plays out.  One Representatives proposal doesnt warrant too much concern to me.  "
publichealth,"MPH programs in general aren’t competitive. I think the average acceptance rate across the field is like 50%-60%.  3.5 GPA and up is great. GRE total score doesn’t mean anything; it’s the percentiles that schools look for and if your above 50th percentile on each section then you’re doing well too.

I’d recommend focusing on identifying programs that have specialize in the fields you’re interested in because you seem to have pretty specific interests, which is a good thing."
publichealth,"Use SOPHAS to see the different degrees the schools offer (esp if you want something specific) and then peruse websites and talk to the program coordinators. 

I used SOPHAS, made a giant spreadsheet, considered locations, cost, and program rank, and then applied. 

Your GPA is fine for a lot of programs (others can advise on what the Top 10 programs look for), but experience and goaks are also an important factor in admissions. "
publichealth,"Whichever is the most affordable, and can get you the most connections is always the best option. However, if you're set on going somewhere prestigious, you could always try using this site:
https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-health-schools/public-health-rankings 

Your GPA seems fine. And while I haven't taken the GRE, I know that you have to have a good overall application to get in anywhere. I'm sorry I wasn't that much help, but hey, I tried…?"
publichealth,"I just applied to 5 MPH programs with basically the same stats. 3.68 pga and also a 310 on the GRE. No Americorps experience, but 3 years volunteering at an HIV clinic as a sexual health educator/tester, 3 years experience as a general chemistry teaching assistant,  and a 4 month internship with the USDA's Extension service in community health. I also had 6 months experience working in a food plant in quality assurance/food safety. 

I applied to environmental health, environmental epidemiology, occupational health and safety, toxicology, and an industrial hygiene program. I've heard back from 3 of the programs with acceptances and should know by March about the other 2 (I missed the priority deadlines for those schools). SOPHAS is really straight forward and easy to manage, applying is kind of pricy when you factor in all the GRE/supplemental apps/application costs though. 

Honestly, MPH programs aren't that competitive unless you're trying to go Ivy League or Emory. I did not apply to these, but chose ones where I had networked during my conference/research/presentation/work/internship experiences in undergraduate. I also factored in cost and if I'd like to live there for the next 2 years. It may seem petty, but I refuse to live somewhere where snow/ice/cold will be a daily struggle in the winter. My SO is in the military, so we tried to plan schools with a &lt; 8 drive from his next station. I also only applied to CEPH certified programs, as my future career path requires that the MPH be from a CEPH certified school. How each person chooses their graduate school is ultimately going to vary based on their own experiences, preferences, and desires. "
publichealth,"CEPH website has a searchable list per major i.e. global health, urban health etc.  So you can narrow your search to schools that tailor to your interest."
publichealth,"I applied to two schools before getting into my first choice. I chose the only in state school that offered public health. I had done my B.S. at UAB in public health and had a gpa of 3.91 at the time I applied. I didn’t have the gre score but I did take the grad level biostatistics I needed to show I could do the course work. I applied to UAB and Tulane and got into both. "
publichealth,"IH is a great career. I'd look for IH Technician jobs to build experience, either with a corporation or a consulting firm. OSHA is also a great place to get a start, and an interesting job. "
publichealth,"This is an incredible write up, thank you so much ❤"
publichealth,"I had a lower GPA than you and a similar GRE score. I've gotten into many top ten programs and am still waiting to hear back from a few more schools. Yesterday I received an acceptance letter from Yale. Your stats will be considered, but they also weigh your SOP and your letters of recommendation pretty heavily too. Just convey, clearly, why you want to earn an MPH and make sure your recommenders know how passionate you are as well. The sky truly is the limit, as cheesy as that is. "
publichealth,"Don't forget international options. [16 of the top 30 ranked](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2017/life-sciences-medicine) schools for life sciences are abroad. (I'm in the MPH program at the 2x-ranked school.)

"
publichealth,"Yes. In my work experience EHS is run under the umbrella of Operations. This isn't always the case, but in construction it seems to hold true. What does that mean? It means that practical experience in how the site actually runs can be a major advantage when the person charged with hiring an EHS manager happens to be the VP of Operations. Basically, you speak their language. "
publichealth,"Gotcha! Thanks for the info! I actually just got an email today to set up an interview for the fellowship I applied for so now I'm not freaking out! Haha. Good luck to you! You may have had your interview already so I hope it went well if it did! "
publichealth,"Hey, do you know if there's any epi concentration people in your field? I'm potentially interested in occupational health but am an epi-trying to find an internship that will give me some exposure in both.
"
publichealth,"I would agree-I just cannot trust it will be there in 10 years. If I had 200k in debt maybe I would, but at 50k I think it will be safer for me to get a private (and hopefully higher paying) job and chip away at it myself
"
publichealth,"https://www.msf.org.uk/job-profile/epidemiologist

There's a video of an MSF epi here, plus the job role, and blogs written by epidemiologists in the field describing their work."
publichealth,You're welcome.
publichealth,"Hmmmm. What comes to mind immediately is the policy side of things. Or, research branches like NIOSH or ACGIH, specifically on the chemical side.

When new chemicals are introduced in the US they do not explicitly have to be proven safe for exposure to humans, or any animal for that matter. They are reviewed under the EPA-Toxic Substances Control Act, but that program was severely underfunded even before Trump took office, and reviews are not as thorough as they should be. Occupational epidemiology saves lives, but it does so by studying the negative health outcomes of the workers exposed to dangerous conditions/chemicals.

Here is what I mean: Why do we have a new rule for occupational exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica? or a rule against friable asbestos? or a very low Permissible Exposure Limit for Benzene? Well, unfortunately the changes in rule came on the backs of those who suffered exposure in the workplace, developed disease in significant enough numbers to persuade the adoption of new limits. Silicosis, Mesothelioma, 4/5 different cancers caused by Benzene exposure....It was the occupational epidemiologists who used data recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other sources to draw correlation/association between occupational exposure and negative health outcomes. It takes people dying or getting sick in significant numbers to change policy, but it takes occupational epidemiologist's research to provide the evidence. It is an important job, but one that comes at the realization of how hard industry can push back on change, at the expense of workers, for profit.

In the EU, new chemicals are only able to be produced AFTER the companies have met a burden of proof that they are safe. In the US, companies push forward with un-tested chemical and will accept the responsibility of the potential harm to workers afterward. I don't see that changing anytime soon. So in the meantime we need people studying occupational exposures and health outcomes to catch potentially hazardous chemicals as quickly as possible.

Sorry for the bleak reply."
publichealth,"What I might suggest is looking for the largest corporate insurers in your area. It is in the corporate insurers best interest to have a healthy workforce, and many have come to the understanding that preventative care and wellness play a vital role in employee health outcomes. Blue Cross Blue Shield is one that comes to mind off the top of my head. Some companies take advantage of insurer's programs which facilitate leading classes, talking about basic tenants of nutrition, exercise, and general health related topics. 

Good luck!"

publichealth,"A good chunk of corporate wellness ties in with Human Resources and sometimes Event Promotion/Planning. Personally, I used to work for Quest Nutrition and corporate training/human resources provided benefits as wellness program (reimbursement for gym, health insurance, free protein snacks/bars/powder/, apparel, etc). It also depends on a company's work culture and I agree with [BSEXSS](https://www.reddit.com/user/BSEXSS) that Insurer's Program such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield are good go-to companies for that. "

I'm thinking: public policy, environmental studies, biology, nursing, health care admin., even psychology and sociology could lead to a job in behavioral health.  Do you enjoy the social aspect or the scientific aspect more?

What I see is recent MPH grads who cannot get a job have no experience.  Experience &amp; location matters in this field.  An MPH with 2 years experience should get you a job, no problem.  However some states don't think highly of public health and spend little money in that area. You may need to go where the jobs are, follow the politics and the funding. "

PH is like cooking in my experience, you can read the recipe and get all the ingredients, but it doesn't mean what you make is gonna turn out like grandma's cooking. Experience plays a large role in this, so I would recommend this to get you back into things. Go pick a health topic that particularly interests you or interested you, and just read the end result of how your local community, county, state, or country is dealing with it. Read up on the reasoning for (implementing) the recommendations or policies; ask what evidence is there for the stance taken.

Echoing everyone else here, look at the course requirements for either degree, epi/biostats, and in all likelihood they're going to overlap on most of the curriculum.  With electives and a thesis project, you can probably suit your interests in either program.

publichealth,"Air quality is tricky, because ""smells like poop"" isn't something a meter can usually measure directly.  There could be a lot of reasons why you're smelling something off, and because of how often we use the term 'xxx smells like shit' when I hear this complaint I don't typically assume it literally means that a person is experiencing fecal smell.

The OSHA PEL (the standard to which they're legally held accountable) is a little weird, it's 10 PPM for construction and shipyards, but not for general industry (ie most office jobs).  The NIOSH REL (a recommendation) is 10 ppm for all workers.  No building manager will ever care about ACGIH TLV's.

Contact your occ health folks.  OSHA won't do anything for you if you're working for the federal government, which I'm assuming you are based on the Architect of the Capital.  Either your employee health clinic or your safety office should point you in the right direction.  But indoor air quality investigations are not easy, may take a really long time, and might not give you the answer you'd like, so be emotionally prepared for that.

publichealth,"Counties occur in space and public health LOVES its maps, they make communicating public health messages a bit easier and that's a plus. From the perspective of biostats, spatial analysis is really interesting math as well. If the spatial class is purely applied, like ""GeoDa for dummies"" or ""ArcGIS for dummies"" where all you do is learn to make maps then that's a little less attractive down the road. If you dig into the spatial matrices, spatial confounding, edge effects and meaty stuff like that then I'd say go for space. The regression stuff you'll learn is a part of that as well though, your regression models don't typically have a spatial matrix and can be confounded by that and spatial confounding is difficult to detect without it. 
An aside, I had a spatial component to my dissertation though I haven't needed to use that stuff since then for various reasons. I love it but I can't apply it now. "

publichealth,"Sorry for not getting back to you earlier on this. I wasn't offended at all and am happy to share some of the good news about some MCH successes in SC. 

The infant mortality rate in SC is improving more quickly than almost anywhere in the country. From the 2005-2007 period to the 2012-2014 period, the SC infant mortality rate dropped by more than 20% - one of only four states (and the only Southern state) to see a drop that large (source: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db279.htm). To learn more about the coordinated effort to reduce infant mortality in SC, check out the SC infant mortality reduction plan (here: www.scdhec.gov/Library/CR-010842.pdf). This plan was developed in a partnership between many public health, clinical, and community-based partners - some of the key partners being the state health department, the state Medicaid agency, the state hospital association, and the state chapter of the March of Dimes. This partnership is called the SC Birth Outcomes Initiative and still holds monthly meetings and an annual symposium. In 2016 an assessment of some of the efforts to-date was done, including a breakdown of some of the things going on in each county of the state (appendix D includes the county-by-county breakdown: www.scdhec.gov/Library/CR-011761.pdf). 

SC has also been at the forefront of efforts to enhance contraceptive access nationally. SC was the first state in the US to change statewide policies to make long acting reversible contraceptives accessible in the immediate postpartum period, developing a best-practice that has been promoted by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the CDC. This generated some fairly substantial media coverage as well (NYT article: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/health/birth-control-medicaid.html). Based on this and other successes, SC was awarded a multi-million dollar grant to launch a broader contraceptive access initiative called Choose Well (http://www.choosewellsc.org/index.html). Choose Well is working to reduce barriers to all types of contraceptives statewide. 

I could easily rattle off 5 other really innovative things going on in MCH in SC, so if you'd like to hear more about what is going on just let me know. In my experience, this is an exciting time to be working in maternal and child health in SC. There is some substantial momentum, but there is still so much to be done that it is almost overwhelming. 

I'm now faculty in a school of public health outside SC. My school has both online and on-ground degree programs, so I know a little bit about how those compare (but not a lot because I'm pretty new here). If you decide to go the online MPH route, just make sure that it is a CEPH accredited MPH program. I saw elsewhere in this post that you may be leaning toward epi/eval types of programs. That is right in my wheelhouse, so if you'd like to talk about opportunities and job markets in SC for MCH research and evaluation just send me a PM. I'll be happy to put you in touch with some folks in this field in SC so that you can get a good idea of what your prospects might be given where your interests and experiences may lie."

publichealth,"EHS Manager living in the Pacific Northwest here. 

My MPH program focus was Environment Safety and Health. The most lucrative jobs for anyone coming out of the MPH program from my cohort were on the private side, in Occupational Health. Hands down. I have friends who specialized in Environmental Health and found jobs working for county health departments, but that were making significantly less ($20,000/year less) than my starting offer. As noted below, after 10 years of public service making minimum payments your loans can be forgiven. Notable is that senior positions on the government side are not as easily attainable as on the private side. 

To become a certified Industrial Hygienist (I am not one) there are a lot of requirements. First and foremost a Bachelors degree (check), 180 Academic contact hours in IH related coursework (toxicology, measurement and controls, etc). 4 years of practice as an Industrial Hygienist under a CIH. You will have to have your current supervisor vouch that you can perform the duties of a CIH, and then pay a fee and pass a test. The IH tech jobs in my area paid between $45,000-$60,000/year depending on experience. Expect a 2-4% rise in annual salary for the first couple years if working in the private sector. CIH's can expect to start at $65,000 and can make well over $100,000 for a senior position. Again, keep in mind that this is region specific to the Pacific Northwest.

I have friends for are Certified Industrial Hygienists, and anecdotally, this is what can you expect to do as a CIH... Perform environmental sampling in occupational settings. Develop sampling plans. Work with businesses to lower the exposures to _________ for their workers. Provide recommendations to workplaces on how to lower exposures. Have pressure applied to you by said business to prove that their current exposure is low enough to not get fined by OSHA. Realize that most companies care more about the bottom line then the overall, long term health of their employees.  Occasionally find employers who are really concerned with the health of their employees and have your faith in humanity restored. Depending on whether you work for a large company with their own CIH's or for a consultant, your experience can vary to the extremes.

Straight out of my MPH I worked for a company who performed environmental remediation (cleaning up Brownfield/contaminated sites), and in that job I performed complex risk assessments to determine occupational exposure to whatever chemical was being cleaned up, created site specific health and safety plans, and recommended PPE and Engineering controls to lower exposures to ""safe"" levels. I worked for a company who allowed my the leeway to use a 1:1,000,000 cancer risk as my cutoff for our exposure levels. Many will allow much more risk, as OSHA's Permissible Exposure Levels may not accurately reflect the current science. Actually, most don't.

Now I work for a startup company that recycles plastics back into usable crude oil or monomer products. I am extremely fortunate that my background fit the requirements of both of these positions. 

If you have specific questions about what I do, what my path was like, what classes may be beneficial, how to find your specific interests, how your background might lend itself to a specific field, or just generally what my day to day is like, PM me. I'd be happy to help.

publichealth,That seems the way to go. Guess I have to deal with being stuck at a dang desk :/
publichealth,Sounds good. Do you mind telling which graduate program you went to?
publichealth,"Pharm needs epi more then they typically admit because epi people are usually trained in both the statistics and the biology of whatever they specialized in. A while back I gave a talk on subtyping a smoking related disease and there were folks there from pharm in the room. Apparently whatever I said convinced them to terminate one drug trial and redesign another. Not big ones or anything, pharm does these small trials in house to test aspects of early phase candidate molecules and drugs that are being repurposed. They are usually a couple hundred people with specific phenotypes that the company wants to present as drug targets. So, anyway, apparently our talk about phenotypes suggested that they couldn't see any outcome from those trials because their phenotypes were crap and they hadn't consulted epi people before launching the trials. 

It's like the CETP inhibitor trials, CETP is where HDL binds in order to do its job. HDL carries things around and onloading and offloading them from cells so if you block CETP then HDL goes up and everyone thinks that increasing HDL is the point since HDL is ""good cholesterol"". It's not, it's an apolipoprotein that has a job to do and measuring it is a fairly crude marker of the cholesterol you have in circulation and what it's doing. So &lt;oversimplification&gt; they blocked CETP, HDL went up and BP went up so they had to stop the trial http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/27/2/257 . Pharm is still hammering away at CETP inhibitors but the suggestion is that you want HDL to do its job not just circulate at a higher concentration. Had pharm asked some apolipoprotein epi people they might not have targeted that sucker in the first place.  &lt;/oversimplification&gt; 

Bringing your epi philosophy to pharm is a good thing as long as you keep them honest and they accept that that's your role.

publichealth,"Hey there! I was an RN, worked in research while getting my MPH in epi. Let me tell you. I have found certain states have LOTS of public health nurse jobs. Some don't have as many. I guess it depends on the structure of the health departments. Anyway, with both degrees I found a lot of PH nurse jobs to choose from. It's mostly 9-5 and you won't make the big bucks, but I like it. "
publichealth,"Since the MPH is not going to be your terminal degree, the name recognition doesn't matter much. It also won't make or break your chances of admission into medical school. They just care about GPA, MCAT scores, and clinical experience (volunteering and clinical research is possible during your MPH program). 

If money is not a concern for you, then by all means go for the big name. I'm at a big name school for my MPH right now, and I love it. The difference between my current school and my undergraduate institution is night and day. Granted, the MPH is a terminal degree for me. A lot of my colleagues plan on going to medical school after graduating though, so it is a common path."

Also, what if families have food allergies/sensitivities or just dislike of certain foods? They just need to suck it up or go hungry? 

"
publichealth,"In keeping a search to one area you will probably send in more resumes than if you had a nation wide search.   When I started out 8 years ago I submitted my resume about 100 times for 4 interviews and 1 offer. 

There are a million reasons you get rejected at the resume stage but if you are getting interviews it means your resume is in good order. It has been few years since I hired an IH but one thing we saw in searches was many people switching jobs after one or 2 years so still entry level but ahead of recent graduates. 

For experience  you seem to have a good amount for an entry level job. Many jobs want experience in their specific industry. Before an interview I would recommend working out how you can connect past experiences to their industry.

publichealth,"I'm at the Austin campus and see TA and GA positions advertised all the time. Maybe 10-15 opportunities a semester come to my inbox? Your offer is probably for the Houston campus I imagine so since there are more professors there I would think there would be more. Positions usually pay around 15 an hour, offer free health insurance and are about 20 hours a week. I don't know for sure since this is the first  year I'm applying for those scholarships but it seems like there's a fair amount of competition  and they aren't for very much money st all. I would definitely recommend talking to the faculty there about funding since I'm not a PhD student. But, overall I would say since biostats is in such a high demand you should definitely go where the money is. UTHealth honestly doesn't seem like it really has it's shit together either to be honest so take heed."
publichealth,"I got into MPH programs with a lower than 3.0 Gpa.  You will be fine. Try mount Sinai in nyc "
publichealth,"Hey,

First of all, please don't beat yourself up! You're competing against really difficult situations that are totally outside of your control. Frankly any University that would judge your circumstances too harshly are probably universities that I wouldn't want to attend, and I wouldn't be too worried if I were you. This is definitely something that would be worth addressing in your personal statement so they know what happened, but don't let it make you think you're doomed to work at McDs forever now.

With that being said, is it at all possible for you to get involved helping out communities at home once your classes and finals for the semester have finished? I think if you're able to volunteer your time helping out with disaster relief it will look fantastic on your CV when you apply for school. I think it would be a really great talking point in your motivation statements for school how you were motivated to join public health after you witnessed first-hand how disasters affect well-being. Even if you're not interested in doing environmental health or disaster relief work, I'm sure you would still be able to speak about it in a way that relates to your goals. Hands on, real world experience works wonders for graduate admissions-Ive gotten into a number of prestigious graduate programs with very average grades because I have real world experience and can speak about how these experiences influence my goals.

I hope that helps! 
Edit: I wonder too if you would have the option of retaking some courses once you graduate?"

Now the problem with retaking the courses is that I'm probably gonna get a C in most of them. In my university if you retake a course with a C, they average your grades and that one goes into your transcript. So it isn't worth it to retake all those courses, bust my butt off to get an A and then having a B- in my transcript."

publichealth,"So I'm in the epi PhD program, not biostats, but yeah that's how it works here. It's pretty easy to get a scholarship to cover tuition, and it also seems relatively easy to find a TA/RA position to cover living expenses, but they won't guarantee it and you can't start trying to get one until you accept your admissions offer. 

The vast majority of the other PhD students work at the surrounding medical institutions prior to starting the program, and keep their jobs part-time to pay their bills. I think one student out of ten in my cohort moved here just for the PhD program and had to find an RA position; the rest of us were already working somewhere in the med center and just continue to do so while in school. "
publichealth,"I got into a top-10 public health program for Epi with a 3.0 and I don't have *nearly* enough extenuating circumstances as you do (though, I did have a few years of work experience between undergrad and grad school).

What programs want to know are: 1) why are you interested in public health, 2) what you want to get out of your degree, 3) can you handle the workload, and 4) what you bring to the table.

Do not give up! If you're truly interested in biostats, reach out to the advisors and faculty at a few schools in that department. Have frank discussions and explain the difficulties WITHOUT MAKING EXCUSES. If you've struggled in math classes, explain how you plan to be able to handle the academic workload of a Masters level biostats program.

Do. Not. Give. Up.

Even if you don't get in the first time, for some reason, you'll get in after one or two years of work experience. Hell, some schools look for that. UW, for example, looks for 2 years of global work experience in order to join the global health track (IIRC)."
publichealth,"TBH, if you advise that Hurricane Maria was a barrier, I think most places will be understanding.

Now there isn't a chance in hell I'm graduating with something close to that. I feel like all that work was in vane. 

I worked in a library for 2 years, went to an internship in one of the top Ivy League universities and have 1 year of research.  Do you think that might help? The chance that I can score another internship or a job related to bioinformatics with my gpa is practically 0%.  I feel like I'm stuck in loser world."
publichealth,Thanks for the suggestions. I'll check them out. I'm planning on taking the GRE once everything is back to normal.
publichealth,"I'm still in my program, but I've heard and talked a little bit about this with professors. For my management course, the instructor who has worked his entire career in hospital administration, stressed many times to us that he, when hiring, is never concerned with grades or GPAs. It's more that you have the skills and not whether you ended up with a B- in a course. Other jobs that are more stats heavy sometimes ask for a transcript to confirm that you have in fact taken courses that give you the foundation needed for data analysis.

I'd say not to worry about it because the ""real world"" and academia are different things. Also, a 3.0 or 3.3 aren't terrible."
publichealth,"Probably not.  Especially if an MPH isn't explicitly required for the job.  "
publichealth,I generally don't think it's a great idea to put your GPA on your resume at all.
publichealth,"Note, that program is crazy expensive.

Since you're interested in biostatistics, why not look for a MS program abroad? It'll most likely be cheaper!"
publichealth,"Hey thanks for the information.  So after the first few years and you finish your coursework and start working on your dissertation full time, does your 'lab' PI cover your funding? Ie, do you still have to work part time after moving onto 100% research?

Ive also applied to bioinformatics phd programs and that is how it works there."
publichealth,Thanks for the advice!
publichealth,"I’ll keep this in mind "
publichealth,"Actally, I haven't even considered it. Do you have any suggestions? I'd be open to studying abroad depending on how cold it is there."
publichealth,Apply for other jobs?
publichealth,"You could write about the health issues that are bothering you. You could try to get an PhD in public health so you can become a director of a program, a professor, or a specialist in a certain disease. If you go for a JD/MPH though, chances are you may end up becoming a lawyer against the pharmaceutical companies/big businesses/enemy-#1. But that's just me. "
publichealth,"Government, pharma, research "
publichealth,"Private sector, clinical trials. Usually pay epis pet well...

I'm interested in going into IC. What is it you don't like about it?"
publichealth,"Well, I have met people who love it, so I think it depends on your personality. I don't like it for a few reasons: 1. You are basically the cop of the hospital and everyone hates talking to you. 2. Opportunities for epi/data folks are very scarce. Most ""hospital epidemiologists"" are still people with clinical degrees (RN or sometimes MD). 3. The entire profession is not very data driven at all. I spend hours explaining why Excel isn't the greatest data analysis software ever. 4. If you have a doctorate, you will never take ownership of a project or run your own research so would be better to actually not go beyond MPH. 5. It is very limiting working with just one hospital/patient population. It gets boring. 6. State and federal reporting requirements are huge and tedious. You will spend the vast bulk of your time making sure .csv files are correctly formatted each month to enter into NHSN and that all of your infections meet the definition they provide and then change every few months. 7. Pay is terrible. I haven't even broken six figures and almost all of my friends with an MPH or less have.

I think if you want a cushy 9-5 job with loads of job security but aren't that ambitious it could be a good job. It is kind of fun investigating outbreaks and the infection practitioner role might be good if you don't care about data."
publichealth,"This is way too vague of a request. What are your interests within public health research? What kind of internship are you looking for (type of work, paid/unpaid/volunteer, etc.)

There are a lot of organizations working in public health in India, doing all sorts of work from sanitation/safe water, to infectious disease surveillance, to community health education."
publichealth,What constitutes financially successful?
publichealth,"sorry I didn’t clarify, I suppose I’m still trying to decide that myself. I guess having the potential to make at least or over 50k "
publichealth,"I'm looking at a paid internship, but being unpaid wouldn't matter either. I'm interested in research. I am interested in community health education research and infectious disease surveillance. Would you advise just finding research NGOs in India and ask about public health research?"
publichealth,"The jobs at that level in what people consider big P public health (local/state/fed gov) are there, however, you’ll have to generally work your way up or be willing to move. My first real ph job was at 32k, 2nd 36k, 3rd 52k, currently 63k as an administrator - I have held a masters through all of these
I could probably greatly increase my pay if I was willing to move to the state capital, but that ain’t happening"
publichealth,"I will second this. Generally what I've found is the higher up the chain you are willing to go, and or more valuable your research is to your field the money follows. State level or higher jobs tend toward really good benefits. "
publichealth,"I assume you're currently in the US? And that you aren't currently in school and getting an MPH or another degree? Do you have a degree in public health?

One option would be to reach out to professors at schools of public health who are working on projects in India or in partnership with Indian organizations. Ask if you could conduct an informational interview. Share your CV, what skills you have, what you're hoping to learn. What will *they* get out of it? They might be able to point you in the right direction.

And randomly, why India specifically?"
publichealth,"I wish location was required for these posts...
In order to make money in PH you need to put your time in.  Experience matters.  That being said.  Any entry level job in my area is 30k-45k. A master's degree and 2+ years experience can get you 55k-70k+.  

Get a job in a public health field and go for your master's while working.  Your master's program will be more meaningful if you're in the field, plus you'll be able to pay some of your tuition, reducing your potential debt. 

I put in over 80 applications over 6 months to get my first PH job.  I had an intern last year that graduated in May.  She had to take a poorly paying part time job, but she did a great job with me and I was able to help get her a decent job in November.  Make a good impression, and network. "
publichealth,"&gt; I assume you're currently in the US? And that you aren't currently in school and getting an MPH or another degree? Do you have a degree in public health?

I am in America, I'm actually a freshman right now in college

&gt;And randomly, why India specifically?

I am indian american and I feel like india is a big place for public health research and its unique because it is a growing economy that has a population suffering from economic and health disparities. 
"
publichealth,"&gt; I am in America, I'm actually a freshman right now in college

You're in the right place then! If your university has a school of public health or medical school or something similar, look through the faculty to see if there are any you might want to talk to. Definitely speak to your academic advisor or (if you have one) faculty mentor. They might know people, and can make the introductions. They might also know of programs that send students to India or other countries for a summer, etc.

Even if your school doesn't have those fields of research, there might be partnerships with schools that do.

&gt; I am indian american and I feel like india is a big place for public health research and its unique because it is a growing economy that has a population suffering from economic and health disparities. 

I had an inkling (I'm also Indian American). While I agree with your points, and definitely encourage you to reach out for internships in India, I also encourage you to consider internships in the US, as well as other countries. Most of the skills you learn in Peru, or Uganda, or New York City are going to translate in Puerto Rico, or Ecuador, or India. Yes, there are going to be cultural differences, but data analysis, or project management skills, or survey design aren't going to be vastly different.

You're a freshman in college, so you have some time to build your skills and experiences before focusing on a specific field."
publichealth,"Yea, I'm going to schedule an appointment with my counselor "
publichealth,"Also I'm going to apply to places in Africa too, no point on being fixated on India "
publichealth,"I have my undergrad degree in global health and I also feel a bit stuck, but in order to get into some of the really good MPH programs you need experience. I feel like it shows commitment to the field and that you plan on actively promoting wellness. Plus, there is always room to move up if not with the company your with then someone else’s. "
publichealth,Community?
publichealth,yeah i think it makes sense ... also is there such thing as a neighborhood health approach?
publichealth,"Sorry, I feel for you.  Are you only looking for jobs that say Industrial Hygiene, or are you looking at safety and EHS positions as well?

I spent a year as a IH technician before becoming an IH, it made a big difference on my resume even though my pay sucked.  Are you looking at government jobs too?  The federal government hires a lot of IHs, especially the DOD.  "
publichealth,"Thanks for your reply.

At this point, I think I'm open to all of the above. I'm definitely expanding my scope of practice. I am also applying for an IH tech position as well, which I am interviewing over the internet tomorrow.

I actually applied for an IH position for a government lab/DoD and got my rejection call today because I ""did not have enough experience"" for the entry level IH position... :\ I'll keep looking at USAjobs and see what comes up so far.

If you don't mind me asking, which state are you an IH in? "
publichealth,"Yeah, USAjobs is tricky.  You'd be looking for a GS9 position, and you have to know how to answer those questions, which is a bit of a hurdle.  They do take fresh people for those 9 positions, but not always without something like veterans preference or something else in your favor 

I work for the federal government, I started off in Pennsylvania but have worked in a few other places, currently in Maryland."
publichealth,"Have not heard of neighborhood health, but community health gets bandied about a fair bit and would directly address your specifics."
publichealth,Have you looked into the University of Rochester at all? Rochester isn’t as brutal weather wise as Buffalo or Syracuse but still gets some snow and cold. The “ticket” price is much more expensive than most SUNY schools but they offer so much in scholarships that if you are in good academic standing the prices should be comparable. The Rochester area has several colleges and universities nearby and also has a large amount of opportunities provided by 2 major hospitals. Look into it!
publichealth,"Thank you for the tip. I'll definitely try applying around more and see what's happening. I have a couple of interviews coming. Some IH related and the other safety (though I prefer more IH, I'll see if I can transfer over to IH eventually??). 

That's great that you're settled in now! It is my dream goal to be an IH for the government. They do lots of neat things. I went through 3 rounds of interviews with a gov't job but was turned down at the last stop... one day I hope to achieve where you are at! You are definitely an inspiration!"
publichealth,"It's not a ballot prop yet. They're still trying to gather signatures. So if you're in California, don't sign and feel free to warn others not to fall for it.

They're stupid. Their idea is stupid. And they should feel bad for bringing it up.

Not sorry."
publichealth,"Personal experiences are my driver. My first year out of undergrad, I volunteered about 100 hours in a low income kindergarten class and saw the harsh realities that a lot of kids face: abuse (including sexual, people suck), neglect, homelessness, undiagnosed/untreated mental health, hunger, poor eating habits, and more. While each kid needed individual care, there needed to be a systemic fix so I went in that direction. 

Also, I realized that intervention effectiveness is a really fun, interesting puzzle and I like figuring out how to measure it. Do what you love, people. "
publichealth,Jfc. That is all.
publichealth,"Yup, this. Trying to reduce pain and suffering "
publichealth,Where did you get your MPH if you don’t mind me asking ?
publichealth,Sure send me a PM although I didn't actually attend so my insight may be limited.
publichealth,"there really needs to be a stronger facepalm emoji. 

��and �� just dont cut it anymore sometimes."
publichealth,"I have a few questions to help me answer you better.
Are you just looking in LA or do you have a wider search area? Are you being rejected after they just view your resume or after the interview? What professional experience do you have? 
"
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"I have always been very interested in social justice and equity. I grew up poor and live in a city that has a pretty stark wealth divide. Maybe this is morbid or cruel but I’m endlessly fascinated by how social inequity is reflected in inequities in different facets of health. 

I’m fascinated by surveillance because that’s the first step to solving any problem. It makes me want to pursue epidemiology bc, as cheesy as it sounds, I feel like public health officials are like the sentinels for public wellbeing. "
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,"Not sure the exact requirement but a lot of out of state students can get state residency after a couple of years and then pay in-state tuition. (I went to SUNY Albany undergrad and had some out of state friends). NYC is EXTREMELY expensive and I would strongly caution against it if you are taking loans and not sure your career path. The earning power of an MPH is not guaranteed and paying off loans is not something I would want to worry about when looking for a job. I went to school in NYC also for grad. school ( I am from there) and the best internships are not guaranteed and very competitive. Hofstra is in Long Island which is quite a commute from many parts of NYC. Albany weather is not that much different from NYC - and I think there are lots of opportunities in Albany  and the surrounding areas there. "
publichealth,"I'm guessing corn, sugar, and cheese"
publichealth,"Short answer, yes, there is complete positive confounding. This is because once you stratify for smoking, there is no association between chromium exposure and cancer.

However also consider the conditions for confounding
1. not on the causal pathway
2. associated with the exposure
3. independent risk factor for the disease

In this case, it could be on the causal pathway. Ie those who are exposed to chromium could plausibly be getting ALL their chromium from cigarettes:

smoking -&gt; chromium -&gt; cancer

&gt; Later if I wanted to assess whether smoking is associated with exposure or whether smoking is associated with lung cancer in the non-exposed, would I just set up the appropriate and solve for the RR or would I need to know the etiologic fraction?

Just set up the tables and solve RR

&gt; When testing for interaction, there is a table that splits up the cases and controls with appropriate individual odds ratios, how would I go about testing for interaction with this cohort study if I do not have cases or controls and cannot calculate an odds ratio?

Do it on RR. 

Hope that helps"

publichealth,"I think you should go in-state to a public school for your MPH, even if it means not getting the name recognition. It doesn't really matter where you go, as long as you have the recommendations and experience to back yourself up. Remember, do it because you want to, not because you think it'll get you into medical school. I feel the same way as you; I'm a pre-med student too, and when I was about to graduate, I thought about attending a one year MPH in my state. Then of course, I'm about to graduate, and I'm on a career path I'm happy with. "
publichealth,"I believe it's true. After all, junk food is often more affordable than regular food, and whenever you're sitting around eating that with your family, you're going to attach some symbols to it. "
publichealth,"I'm not saying I agree with Trump's administration, but a couple of years ago I did take a picture of [RedBull qualifying for EBT](https://imgur.com/4ZaxcqM). As someone in PH, the idea bothered me enough to take a picture :-) "
publichealth,"I completely agree with you. There are definitely some items that are more ""luxury"" and have no nutritional benefit, but I'm very skeptical of the nutritional content of these boxes. "
publichealth,"That’s some great advice. Thank you for taking the time to write it out. If you don’t mind me asking, what were your interests going in?"
publichealth,"Hi! Same thing I asked below, what were your interests going in and what are they now? Also, what other schools did you have up against Columbia?"
publichealth,Good luck!!
publichealth,"Eh, I would give the idea a pass. "
publichealth,"I'd probably take the cool job over the fellowship any day. While a fellowship may help you experience wise, I feel like the cool job will teach you more than you ever imagined. 
"
publichealth,"I’m the person who replied above. I was just adding that I attend Columbia. And Columbia was really my only choice, because I initially started with the MPA and only after I decided to do a joint MPH. So I didn’t apply to any other public health schools. "

publichealth,"I am in the same boat. I have worked in the field for over 10 years, but in order to do more data analysis type of work, a Master's degree seems to be minimum criteria for them to even look at my application. And I much prefer the idea of getting a MSc or MPH degree in Europe that I actually have enough money to pay for without taking out loans-- rather than a well-respected MPH degree in the US that will take me years to pay back. With my work experience, I don't anticipate having trouble finding a job after graduate school in the USA, though I wouldn't mind living in Europe longer term, either. It also helps that I have a Bachelor's from a top university in the US, so I think it is not so important where I get the Master's degree. I hope more people comment on this thread with feedback, though! "
publichealth,"If by software you run in SQL in do you mean like Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Developer, Toad, Teradata, etc.? If yea, it doesn't really matter too much. I routinely switch between SQL Developer (Oracle) and MS SQL Server because the differences are relatively minimal.

I highly doubt the majority of people with simply ""analyst"" in their name need much more than a basic stats background. Source: I work with multiple senior data analysts who couldn't even tell you what a simple linear regression is. But they understand databases, data structures, business requirements, coding, and how to generate counts and frequencies so they do well enough.

publichealth,"Go whichever is cheaper... you have to pay off the debt once you graduate and post-MPH jobs don't pay that well.

Both programs are CEPH-accredited.. so it doesn't matter. The key thing is to gain experience to put on your resume.

Columbia may help you network, as it is big SPH with a lot of alumni, while NYU is not.. but that isn't worth the price-tag and it's not a guarantee

publichealth,"Wow, really? That's really strange. I have known multiple people leave academia where I work now and get hired by the state and federal government because of their SAS programming skills so I always assumed that's what people use there. Maybe California just has more money for that type of stuff though.

I also can't imagine trying to manage lots of data using excel. I did that for quite a while as a student working in a research lab and it was quite a big mess looking back at it. So many problems and issues could have been fixed by just using a basic database. 

I still believe that learning programming skills is way more important and useful than focusing on excel. You can always learn excel once you have a job that needs it, but knowing programming will make it that much easier to learn how to automate repetitive tasks and generate reports and whatever else is needed."
publichealth,That sounds like a super cool job. Super jealous!!
publichealth,Would you say it is primarily research based?  I work best applying other peoples research and not trying to conduct novel experiments.
publichealth,"Hi H_zero, your career path is very intriguing. Would you be interested in contributing your public health career story/journey on the phspot.ca blogs? "
publichealth,"Yes . Learn databases and SQL . Along with R and Python "
publichealth,"If you really want to move into one of thoae jobs and have tried without success, then yeah, more education sounds reasonable. Sounds like you matched each possible job with the associated schooling well, the only thing i would add would be further statistical and data science type knowledge if you want to go down the BA path for very large orgs."
publichealth,"I was always really interested in preventive medicine and seem to have ended up in a public health job. The paths i sought were nutritional nueroscience, genetics counselling, and public health nutrition. Hope this might help in some random way."
publichealth,"Not research like us hard science people think of. It's just background/informative research. Doctor's contact us about how to diagnose/treat rare infections, or just general questions. I do A LOT of rabies assessments. It's just about doing enough background research to be able to recommend best practices.

Edit: One thing I wanted to add is the importance of having people with strong science backgrounds in public health. The two biggest challenges in public health are 1) knowing what best practices are and 2) convincing people to use those practices. There is a huge gap between knowledge and practice. We need people who can digest complicated scientific information and present it in an understandable way to different audiences. We try to write all of our public info at a 3rd grade level. Understanding enterotoxin food poisoning and how it differs from traditional food-borne illness is tough. Explaining it at a 3rd grade level is tougher. A strong scientific understanding is indispensable for this kind of work."
publichealth,"I think they fit well. I did an AS in biology then a BS in public health. During BS, worked as a research assistant in a environmental microbiology lab. Then switched to policy for MPH, but many peers are doing MS. The ones I know want a career in one of the university labs or other public health labs under a PI. MS in public health sounds like a great option, and links well with PA school so you’ll have an advantage with knowledge of the social determinants of health and whatnot. "
publichealth,"Where do you work, that sounds awesome?! I’m currently getting my MPH, and was bio undergrad. I’m missing some of the more biological focus in my classes right now"
publichealth,Local health department. I mostly do investigations (interview cases and provide prevention education) and create fact sheets\web content on communicable diseases...
publichealth,"I think it would help to take a programming class. I am using R in biostatistics right now and had no experience with programming and am drowning. It seems like learning R and/or Stata would be helpful for prospective MPH Epi students. "
publichealth,"I can’t see it a being a possibility. I would imagine your supervisor knows that it’s not applicable, and also that it would probably lead to you leaving the job. Neither scenario comes across as a good use of funds. Also, consider this - if a person sticks their neck out and allocates funding for your degree program, and you blow out of there right after you finish, you’ve taken a large swipe at their performance evaluation. Get a loan."
publichealth,"Are you interested in clinical research?  My colleague and I both have a Bachelor's in Public Health, and we run research studies for surgeons at an academic medical center.

publichealth,This doesn't answer your question; it's actually more me asking you a question if you dont mind! I am also post-bachelor's and applied for a similar fellowship with ORISE about a month ago. How did they inform you of your phone interview? Was it via email?
publichealth,Epidemiology Disease Investigator
publichealth,"Bio stats/ Epi vs. Community health are like 2 totally different majors.  Here's the nitty gritty of it. You'll probably make more money in Epi.  If that's your end goal, do that.  

Community health is much more social, you're working with the public and with professionals.  You'll likely be out of your desk more, going to different agencies and events.  If you enjoy interacting with people, you may find this field rewarding.  

I work in community health, policy advocacy.  I found epi and bio stats challenging. I like looking at the numbers, but I don't like crunching them.  Hopefully I gave you some insight into community health and a  epidemiologist can jump in and tell you what it's like to work in that field. "
publichealth,"Thanks for your help! Do you find that it’s hard to find jobs in community health related work though (I’m pursuing an MPH)? In terms of the job market, is there less of a demand for community health related workers? "
publichealth,"Job availability really depends on your location.   CA has a lot of opportunities right now, the politics is welcoming for workers in this field.  I can't speak to other areas but I would guess more conservative states would have less opportunities. 

I competed my MPH while working full time in the field, so when I finished I had 5+ years of experience.  I applied to a dozen jobs, got 3 interviews.  My experience combined with my education made me very appealing.  Without experience you'll be confined to an entry level job, but an MPH will help you move up quickly. "
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"Seconding what /u/monkeytypewriter said. 


ORISE interviews are variable and about the program and people you will be working with rather than a designated formal process in most cases. 


As far as more general advice goes, practice your elevator speech, prep answers for some general behavioral questions, have a copy of your CV/resume in front of you, write down some general short-term and long-term career goals you have, and prepare some questions to ask your interviewers about the position and their work.  "
publichealth,3.3+
publichealth,"As a master's student? Ask schools what they can offer (that's how I got a half scholarship) but the odds of getting fully (or even close to fully) funded is pretty much zero. "
publichealth,"I think it is very unlikely that you will be able to swing that and it might burn some bridges.

That said, if others have taken some courses, why don't you, and do some research first to see if they'll transfer to whatever degree you do later?"
publichealth,"This is all excellent advice.  The only thing I would add, although it probably goes without saying, is to really do your homework on the position, the program itself and the expectations they have for your role. Read through the group's publications, anticipate how your efforts and skills might fit in, and use this to anchor some of your answers.

I can't tell you how refreshing it is to have a candidate a) familiar and knowledgeable about at least the basics of your program work; and b) able to clearly articulate the value they bring to the table."
publichealth,"Unlike undergrad, there are very few scholarships and grants available for master's students. Your best bet is to research private scholarships and apply to as many as you can. Many schools give small scholarships for students who did well in undergrad (GWU gives an achievement scholarship for students who earned 3.3 or 3.4 in undergrad), but these are pretty small. "
publichealth,"Seconded again! "
publichealth,"I can't compare Yale to other schools as I have only done public health at Yale.

What I can tell you is that YSPH has a great student/faculty ratio, and that (outside of core prerequisites which everyone has to take and therefore the class size is relatively big), the faculty are eager to connect with students. 

I had multiple options for my summer internship, all through the connections I made with the faculty in my first year, and multiple options for my MPH thesis, all through similar connections. 

Many people I know do part-time research work while in school, all through faculty connections.

(On the management side, I know there are additional opportunities for students who are looking to get into consulting, but I don' know the details.)

The careers office here is top-notch, and has many networking opportunities with prospective employers outside of Yale. (Both for internships and for post-graduation jobs.)

Incidentally, there are a lot of PH grads who can't find jobs, and my opinion is that a good career office and a good alumni network (both of which Yale has) are critical to being able to find a job after graduation. Ultimately, it's your ability to find a (well-paying) job that justifies program cost (and the attendant loans). 

Aside from that, it's hard for me to comment on the financial side of things as I am in a joint physician assistant / MPH program and the financial situation for me is totally different; I'm in school longer, but I'm going into a field with a higher median post-graduation salary."
publichealth,"That was excellent. Thank you for this - something I’ve heard in regards to UW as well. I’ll let it sit and if I come across any other questions I know who to ask! Thanks so much, and good luck!"
publichealth,"Did you ever get an answer to this question? I’m considering the program. "
publichealth,[deleted]
publichealth,"Hey! I can kind of help you out re the Paris program. I applied for the Europubhealth Erasmus program and they work with EHESP in Rennes and in Paris. I know nothing about the Rennes school but I spoke to some current students at the Paris school and they said the school has huge administration problems (vive la France!). This might just be a problem with the erasmus program and not the school overall, but I would take some caution. PM me if you want specifics :)"

publichealth,"Given that Republicans enacted this ban I find this highly suspicious. Who gave the orders here? 

Also, I'm going to bet that any amendments are going to be of a highly restricted nature rendering results almost useless."
publichealth,Then they'll release the results in memo form
publichealth,"I'm really not sure about that, sorry. I'm assuming it would depend on your dissertation advisor and if they have funding for you to do your dissertation with them. I'll be doing my dissertation in my work lab, and I believe that many others do the same. One thing to note is that the program is pretty short as everyone comes in with an MPH (or MS for biostats), so it's generally about 3 years (2 years course work, 1 year dissertation). "
publichealth,"No. I have hired on the Occupational and Environmental side in industry and having the degree is all that matters. "
publichealth,"I made this comment in another thread, but note that he only says in situations of mental health. It's basically saying that the problem is mental health, not access to guns. It's BS that the CDC can't do gun research when it's an obvious issue. "
publichealth,There is no ban on research. This nonsense was thoroughly refuted yesterday on truereddit.
publichealth,"&gt;It's BS that the CDC can't do gun research when it's an obvious issue. 

Yes"
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,I guess they could research it as long as it doesn't cost any money. Not allowing them to spend money on an avenue of research is effectively a ban on that research.
publichealth,"That's not what the Dickey Amendment does, at all. You're literally perpetuating a falsehood. Stop   it."
publichealth,"It’s icing the kicker, my guy "
publichealth,"Still not a ban. I'd like to point out that the NIH has the same restrictions and yet they pump out studies all the time.

Further the CDC also does studies,  famously they did one for Obama. 

There is no ban on the CDC or anyone else doing firearms studies. It's a myth perpetuated by the ignorant and political hacks.
"
publichealth,"THEN WHY DON'T WE FUND MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND TREATMENT?!

sorry, just been yelling that at the radio for a few days now..."
publichealth,No :(
publichealth," ""None of the funds made available in this title may be used, in whole or in part, to advocate or promote gun control.”

There’s no ban on violence research. You don’t need an MPH to figure that out. The CDC can fund and do all the epidemiological studies they want on the issue, so long as they don’t make policy recommendations that advocate or promote gun control. It’s really simple. 

The decision to conduct little to no research on the matter is driven internally at the CDC, as to avoid any potential running afoul with the Dickey Amendment. That’s a nuance well misunderstood. 

"
publichealth,"Come on now. The year the amendment passed the cdc budget was lowered by the amount they spent on gun research. You can argue semantics all day long, but there’s not going to be gun research at the cdc until the Dickey amendment is gone. "
publichealth,"Huh, is this fake news then?

The executive order went out with the last president. 
I get it! I know being technically right is the best kind of right sometimes. It’s a rush! I know we’re all glad that you know the definition of a ban. "
publichealth,"Epi MPH student at Emory here. Having fantastic luck with job offers both for work study and summer practicum. Feel very supported and confident in our career development Office. Looked at mailman, Bloomberg, UNC, and Rollins. Picked here. 

Your information is wrong. One thing you will learn in your mph studies is to not Cherrypick stats. Emory has around 60% employed full time public health. But only 6% still seeking work actively. So really if you are just worried about career progress 94% of Emory students are advancing their career either part time, continuing education, or full time. 

Columbia’s program only had an 82% response rate compared to Emory’s 98% response rate. So granted Columbia reported only 2% actively seeking work but I would say it’s a fair assumption that of the 18% that didn’t respond some may have felt no need to respond as they were having trouble with their job search and were still actively seeking. I might even venture to say that some might be bitter and not feeling supported. 

Columbia does have higher average starting salaries but that is also most likely explained by the fact that a large chunk of graduates are employed in NYC which has an astronomically higher cost of living than Atlanta, where many emory graduates find work. Another note on salary comparisons would be that a large chunk of Emory graduates are employed in the public sector which pays much less than private sector. 

They are both fantastic schools and when you get to the level of mailman, rollins, Bloomberg, etc you are really splitting hairs and the draw for each school is the location and their specific public health specialty. Emory for instance is basically a training camp for CDC employees whereas Bloomberg excels in global health (I think that’s correct, I really can only speak for Emory for sure). It’s less about employment statistics and more about how much you want to invest in your education, what you want to do in the field, and how the school’s specialties align with those goals. 

What I can tell you from my experience is that Emory has fantastic career services that support their grads for LIFE. Alumni from years past are constantly still utilizing the resources Rollins offers. Like I said, I can’t really speak personally about Mailman but I know that Rollins isn’t abysmal like you make it out to be. Graduates from Rollins are extremely successful 9.4 time out of 10. 

*stats were all taken from epidemiology program statistics for Rollins and the mailman full employment statistics report available on both respective websites. "
publichealth,"Emory has a biannual career fair with dozens of employers that are there specifically to offer interviews for jobs. Very much almost lining up to hire their students. "
publichealth,"I have mad respect for the program, which is why their published stats were surprising. I definitely didn't cherry pick, I've looked at these over and over (specifically HPM) and the full time rate is 57%, though I understand some choose not to look for those positions. Those with part time, though they may want more could be technically not actively seeking any more though. 

I think you may have read into my impressions on both, but I understand wanting to defend something you care so much about. And hey that says loads about how Emory has been for you! I've just gotten a little graduate school visit fatigue, where all the ""ambassadors"" are super ethusiastic but you ask and many don't have full time job offers. It's scary!"
publichealth,"I think it works because you can really only focus on that one class at that time and throw yourself into it. The shorter time period is great because it’s a lot easier to remember everything you’ve learned in the time frame and, if you do it right, the classes line up in a progression that builds on itself. 

I found that in regular semester uni courses I would always be bouncing around and only giving attention to the classes with the most urgent assignments. It was also harder to make connections between materials in different classes since my schedules never lined up in a cohesive way. 

Of course everyone is different! "
publichealth,"This type of schedule is one of the main reasons EHESP stood out to me. It seems like it would be a huge perk for my learning style. I did much better in college summer school (when I took one intensive class and worked part-time) than in the regular year when my focus was so scattered, and I enjoyed it a lot more too, because I could delve in and not feel like I had many other things hanging over my head. "
publichealth,"If you want to be really nosy (or... proactive and resourceful), there are several Facebook groups for students and alumni that you could use to find some students to talk to about it. I live in the NW USA and would feel a bit invasive doing something like that, but maybe that is just a mixture of my local culture and my own personality. You can also find some students on ResearchGate; maybe that would seem more professional. ;)

Side note: I have been going through and finding/reading the faculty members' publications, and based on that, it definitely seems like environmental health is a strength and focus there. "
publichealth,"HPM is in high demand. I wouldn’t worry about employment after graduation especially in this job market. I also went to Emory and agree there’s more to it than the 57% figure and that shouldn’t dissuade you. I know a lot of people go into consulting which might or might not be public health. And for some people that’s what they choose to do.

Both schools are great but offer different experiences so go with your gut. I would go with the school whose faculty do research you’re interested in."
publichealth,"I mean, even from the hpm stats the still seeking stat is only 14%. That is pretty high but the HPM program is pretty small and definitely doesn’t have he networking in place that epi does. My main point was that mailman lumps everything in to one big category. So anyone that is doing any work of any sort is all in that same big category. It shouldn’t really be surprising. I mean there are tons of schools that don’t publish those employment outlines.

I think my other big point, honestly, is that for a driven, talented student 86% employed or continuing education should be effectively the same as 96% employed or continuing education at mailman. You should probably strive to at least be firmly in the middle of the pack, if not at the top, so that bottom percentage shouldn’t even come in to the picture. Plus again you are blatantly ignoring the way the breakdown is reported. Columbia doesn’t in any way distinguish between full or part time. 80% of their graduates could be employed part time for all we know based on the information they publish unless I am just missing something. 

You get caught up in these stats and you will be stressed to the max. It never stops. Right now it’s stats on job placement. Next it will be stats on fellowship placements. After that stats on average salaries. Then stats on number of full time positions available versus number of applications.  If you have the ability to get in to these top schools then you have the ability to be successful in the field. doesn’t matter at all what other people do. If you make the most of your time at any of the top public health schools no one is going to be turning you away. I would even go so far as to say A student that makes the most of the opportunities they have even state school that isn’t ranked may even look better than a lazy dead beat that just skirted by at a top 5. "
publichealth,I did and am working as a Health Promotion Specialist for a university. I love it!
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"Excellent! I’m happy for you, I hope to get there some day lol. I definitely am happy with my decision and health promotion seems like it has tons of responsibilities but I plan on getting a lot of experience and doing as well in school as I can. "
publichealth,"I had a b.s. in microbiology. My mph was in industrial hygiene but I know there were microbiology people in epidemiology, biostats, policy, and health promotion as well. Your program should ensure everyone is on the same page, so if you're interested, go for it and pick whatever direction you're interested in. "
publichealth,Amazing! I just msg'd you :)
publichealth,"I got into public health late in my life.  Coming through pharmaceutical industry, but interested in healthcare financing, healthcare equity, Medicaid, high risk populations etc. Are you at BUSPH still?"
publichealth,"I'm not sure where you are located, but in Pennsylvania there's a group called Pennsylvania Public Health Association (PPHA). So maybe look into something like that?"
publichealth,"I’m just an undergrad student and haven’t paid to become a member yet, but I believe American Public Health Association (APHA) is one of the bigger ones. "
publichealth,"I suggest the local public health associations, usually at state level.   They are not as big or known as APHA, but the membership is cheaper and you'll get more networking opportunities and local conferences.

Then you can find national subspecialty associations based on your interests in the field.  For example, I  am involved in APIC (infection control), AOHP (Occ health), and SHEA (hospital epidemiology)."
publichealth,"My MPH is focused in policy, but I have three staff reporting to me in my department that MPH Health Promotion is a great fit for.

I would not consider Communication and Marketing to be as good of a fit.  The folks on my Team create health education materials, teach health courses, and do program evaluation.   I feel they are far more prepared for the public health work in our department with MPH compared to many other graduate degrees.

I don't think Communication/Marketing would provide enough background in behavior change theory, health system organization, or health literacy.   I'd likely still interview them if they scored well on other areas, but something in healthcare would boost their chances of being hired.  I do think that degree would translate to non-health roles more smoothly... but then why get an MPH at all?

If you do Communication as your graduate degree,  but still like health education, maybe add the CHES to get grounding in health behavior theory."
publichealth,"Depending on your focus, the student membership for [American Statistical Association](http://www.amstat.org/) is pretty reasonable ($25) and they have some great resources. 

"
publichealth,"&gt;If you make the most of your time at any of the top public health schools no one is going to be turning you away. I would even go so far as to say A student that makes the most of the opportunities they have even state school that isn’t ranked may even look better than a lazy dead beat that just skirted by at a top 5.


Agree COMPLETELY and I think this point is lost a lot when people are looking at schools

"
publichealth,"I think it all depends in what direction in Public health you go in. I'm in APHA and state-level PHA. State level has been easier to meet people, but I do enjoy the national conference.

I've also been in SOPHE before (Society for Public Health Education).

There are some health policy and health stats groups too, connected to ASA. "
publichealth,"That doesn't mean a whole lot to me. You and I are both very well aware of the limits of any one study, NIH funded or not, well designed or not. Hence, it is what it is as the study doesn't attempt to claim something it doesn't actually measure, how ever flawed it's metric may be.

I would recommend you actually read the intentions of the authors and their study. In the mean time, I wouldn't be so quick lol at unfinished studies that don't overstate their conclusions. They published their year one results, nothing wrong with that while both the article and study acknowledge the limitations what you mentioned, so my question to you is what exactly is your insight?"
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,"I don’t need you to be condescending and tell me to read the study, I’ve already read it. The article was shared by several friends I have in the public health professional field and we all thought the limitations and the measurement variables sucked. We’re looking at changes in medical spending and whether or not they run a 5K in a year? I’m not sure why you’re so defensive over me not liking this. "
publichealth,"What’s your employer’s track record for sending people to conferences?
Will this conference improve your job performance?
Do they know you plan on lounging around before/after the conference!"

publichealth,"The [side effects](https://www.bu.edu/cte/about/frequently-asked-questions/) aren't *just* suicide. It also mimics a lot of what dementia patients have (and may even lead to it in some cases) such as memory loss, undead anxiety, aggression, etc.

I mean, some individuals don't experience the same patterns because their environment may have been different--they may have not experienced concussions, they may have been playing more gentle or with less rough opponents.

And comparing between career choices is dumb. Veterinarians and dentists (both with high suicide rates) aren't being injured for years in preparation for their careers. The comparison doesn't work."
publichealth,"Those are my thoughts exactly. 

But what about people who want to compare it to say, veterans or coal miners?"
publichealth,"I’m in the same boat as op. I have a sociology undergrad degree and I am really torn between community health, healthcare management, and maternal and child health concentrations. The majority of my experience would probably relate to maternal and child health but I am worried about the job market for that concentration. I was thinking about pursuing healthcare management since there is such a strong market, then follow it up with a maternal and child health certificate. Thoughts? "
publichealth,"Coal miners typically don't receive head injuries; usually, their injuries are within the lungs and respiratory system. It's not really comparable.

Same thing with veterans; it's a completely different working environment. There's also significantly less professional football players than veterans by which to make a fair comparison."
publichealth,Very driven!
publichealth,"That would've been a smart idea, however I'm planning on ""leaving"" by this Fall. I'd stay if they paid for it but otherwise, I'm kind of sick of HE :/"
publichealth,"The problem with your question is that public health is literally everywhere, so there is no simple answer. You should narrow public health down some and then ask again. 

One way you can do this is by looking at the different tracks and concentrations and practice areas on the website of any school of public health."
publichealth,"Well, to open with positive news, you can easily volunteer with your local Medical Reserve Corp, they usually work hand in hand with public health emergency preparedness. Google it! Can you just volunteer at a health department? If you aren’t an intern, probably not! The health departments I’m in are pretty much medical facilities, and we don’t need unaffiliated folks. Sorry. This is pretty true across the board, especially in any one that provides direct patient care. Now that’s not to say that you might live in a state where local public health is very very small, like Nebraska. Maybe you could squeeze in there? 

Jobs? There is a glut of MPH and BSPH holders across the board. Nothing is impossible, but if you are currently attending a school with a moderately ok school of ph, then there are probably a lifetime’s worth of job candidates within a stone’s throw. If you are a newbie to the field with minor experience, then your MPH is like a bachelors, and a BSPH is an associates. There are a ton of old timers who went back for MPHs, so that means there’s a ton of folks with a MPH and 20 years. And these people have refined skills both soft and hard. "
publichealth,"You have to be honest -could you have stood the job for 18-24 months PLUS however many Years you would be obligated to stay? You wouldn’t be getting a 1 degree = 1 year trade, I imagine"
publichealth,"Thanks. Yes, I can see I asked a broad question. I have looked at programs’ websites, but I’m interested in several tracks. Only looking at info on the Internet can only help so much, so that’s why I was thinking about more hands-on ways to narrow my interests. "
publichealth,"I’ll look into MRC, thanks."
publichealth,"There are some jobs that use a similar skill set. Like data analysis jobs. Otherwise it's mostly Pharma, university or gov jobs. 

But please, correct me if I am wrong, I am a European that moved to the States to work in Public Health, so my last job search in the EU is almost a decade ago. I am curious what others say about this."
publichealth,"Berkeley SPH is another option? There are also non-profits and corporate internships with a public health/epi slant, depending on what you're specifically looking for."
publichealth,"There are a few post-baccalaureate public health lab fellowships out there if that's something of interest.  For example, APHL's Infectious Diseases fellowship program (which is unfortunately on a pause this year), is intended to expose BS grads into state/federal public health labs.  Worth googling around a bit, anyway."
publichealth,"I applied to all of those a few years ago (though not for the same degree). They all were fairly quick (ranging from a few days/weeks to about a month) with the exception of LSHTM which apparently sometimes has problems with its application portal. If you haven't heard from them after two months I would suggest contacting them. "
publichealth,"Art therapy comes to mind. I knew some people working on analyses of art therapy interventions in quality of life for cancer patients a while back. It's probably tough to measure but when you increase a persons access to self expression I believe that that increases their quality of life. It's a fuzzy intervention but I'd call it public health!

Depending on what you mean by art (visual? musical? poetic?) there are lots of other avenues where you could participate in what I consider good public interventions. As an example I love the work that these folks do http://www.artfromashes.org/ They take at risk kids, support them, help them express themselves through poetry/spoken work and assess the impact of the intervention on the kids processing of school, school work, school related interactions, all that stuff. The kids report that the programming and environment give them access to self control that they never had in the past. Really, really nice work but local to the Denver area. If I were you I might consider looking for 501(c)3 orgs doing work like this in your area. They might not SAY public health, they might not know that they're DOING public health but they damn well are!"
publichealth,"Depends on your specific training, if you're willing to relocate and what you want out of life really. Personally I graduated with a job since I started applying almost a year out. Applying helped me realize what employers wanted out of an MPH so I took those classes (math and data management) and got a job as a Research Assistant. I used the Tulane job board extensively but also The Chronicle (of higher education).
"
publichealth,"Need more details on your field of study, your previous experience and skills, your rough location, and your interests in order to provide meaningful advice.

Some schools provide help to recently graduated alumni, so I'd certainly reach out to former professors, advisors, and career center staff. You should also look at the job boards for other schools (Emory has their Public Health Employment Connection (IIRC the name...) for example)."

publichealth,What do you do in your career and how did you get into it?
publichealth,"The value and importance of Data Visualization is rapidly growing in public health arenas. I’d think one could pretty easily do private consulting and make a career of artistically displaying other agencies’ data and conducting training seminars in this area. Like Tufte, but useful."
publichealth,"Like another commentator mentioned, infographics are all the jazz right now.  Also, health educational materials.  I'm forever creating fact sheets and putting together packets, creating displays.  I wish I was more artistic. "
publichealth,"I can possibly chime in here. I have a geography (GIS) background and I work at a university research institute essentially doing public health research and then visualizing the data. Typically I'm making maps. I get to do a lot of design work for meetings and presentations, and especially I get to work in Adobe CC a lot. We also have a person here that is essentially the office graphic designer. She gets ""final"" work from us researchers and makes the actually-final powerpoints, posters, infographics, etc. I'm more of a researcher &amp; designer, she's 100% a designer with an academic background.

If you're epi/biostat...have you ever taken a GIS/cartography class? Dataviz may be a direction to look into. I love it. You might also want to look into Health Promotion...because a beautiful infographic is promotion in itself."
publichealth,"Thanks for this advice! If I may ask, what's your job title? I will def look out for GIS classes.  Funny you mention Dataviz. I am not that from them. "
publichealth,"Hey there, If you are willing to relocate and try out some interesting opportunities, take a look at PHspot.ca. if you're subscribed to their newsletter, you will receive hand picked jobs and resources weekly. Full disclosure: I'm part of the team that's building this platform. "
publichealth,"Gonna need some more details. "
publichealth,Data visualization like others have said. Being able to wow a room is just as important as good research. I have seen fantastic research either terrible presentation or terrible graphics that stakeholders can't head or tail of it. Mapping lends itself to this pretty well.
publichealth,"TIL that BRFSS measures health literacy. I didn't know; what does the variable look like? And depending on your state, it can be tough to get BRFSS data, so your professor is right about that. 

If you can find a health literacy dataset you can always propensity score match it to something like NHANES. I don't think NHANES measures health literacy but I believe it has a PA recall.  Or as someone else mentioned, use NHIS data. I can think of several physical activity datasets, but not ones that also have flu questions or health literacy. Sorry :( "

publichealth,"This is going to sound harsh, but bear with me.

That's a LOT you're saying.  These are hard classes and a lot of them.

My suggestion would be to take a deep breath, then maybe 2 more.  See if you can start working in the field you want to ultimately end up in, even if it's just interning or shadowing for a few hours a week.  A lot of young people entering the workforce want some uber-specific career field because it sounds awesome or they met one Population Neuroscientist who was awesome.  But specificity sometimes closes doors, especially when you're just starting out.

I'm not saying Population Neuroscience isn't your calling.  But, that's REALLY specific, especially considering that your work doesn't necessarily sound to be very much on the lab science end.

Your plan to do an informal post bac is a good one.  Your plan to do an MPH is also good.  I'd tackle the post bac first, my STEM coursework in undergrad was generally a whole hell of a lot harder than anything I did for my MPH.  Also, 3.65 isn't a bad GPA, don't beat yourself up about that.  I barely had a 3 when I finished undergrad, and now I have an MPH after my name.  They care less about your GPA than they do about who you are and what you bring to PH.

If, by the time you've finished your MPH, and you've got enough of a hard science background to be competitive for your PHD, awesome, go for it.  But that'll be a few years away from today, and life happens fast, man.  I was all about going to medical school, and after a few years of being a pre-med realized I wasn't cut out for it.  (Namely, I like being able to be truly off the clock, something a doctor often can't do)  So I found a similar career that fit with me a lot better, purely by accident.

So, just relax, start it one class at a time, and accept that your grand plan may change!"

publichealth,"I wouldn’t recommend a pre-med post bacc if you aren’t planning on applying to medical school. Often these programs are extremely intensive, and part of what you are paying is advisement and connections specifically to get into medical school. They may sound attractive because they market themselves for people who have already graduated and trying to switch fields, but I think you would benefit from something more flexible. If your goal is to ultimately obtain a PhD in a neuroscience related field, then you should only focus on the necessary course pre-requisites to make that happen. Other than that, you’ll want research experience to demonstrate your interest. During your PhD, you can specialize in neuroscience and how it relates to population heath - but I don’t think a pre-med Post bac or MPH is necessary for that goal.  

Edit: if you want a more structured program, you may want to apply to an MPH program that would simultaneously allow you to fulfill the neuroscience pre-requisites. This may make it longer to graduate, but you’ll be in a more structured environment with perhaps greater possibility to gain research experience. You can generally apply for MPH programs with your current experience (except Biostats) so long as you have one biology and/or one statistics course "

publichealth,"Not harsh at all! This is exactly the sort of feedback I was hoping for. Thank you for such a thorough response.

I wanted to err on the side of specificity with regard to career goals, but your point is well-taken.

If I can ask for clarification on the post-bac plan: You say an informal post-bac is a good idea and that I should tackle the post-bac before my MPH; are you suggesting taking courses at a community college, a four-year college, or ... something else? Just want to make sure I understand! (I live near a good CC as well as a four-year state school, so devising my own post-bac is a viable option.)

Thank you for your insight and help!"
publichealth,"I say ""informal"" to mean whatever classes you want.  I don't know what courses you're looking to take, but I'm assuming it includes a calculus class, a stat class, then biology and chemistry (probably some advanced classes for both).  A structured post bac sounds like a lot of work compared to just taking the classes on your own, especially since they're for your knowledge moreso than for your GPA.

I'd just take what you can at community college.  Classes aren't cheap, and CC can help with that.

I'd only suggest taking those before the MPH just because organic chemistry and stuff like that is a real challenge for a lot of folks.  My lab partner slept through it and said it was easy, but organic kicked my ass thoroughly.  I would suggest taking those super hard courses to see if you still want to do all that after.  Organic, Biochem, and classes like that weed out a lot of premeds for good reason, and I have no doubt neurology doesn't require studying that stuff and harder stuff too.

Your milage may vary on the MPH but I thought it was a cakewalk in comparison. "
publichealth,"Thank you for your response!

I hear what you're saying about the incongruity of a pre-med post-bac with my career hopes. The particular program I have in mind (Mills College) also supports students going into lab sciences and research, but it is still heavily geared toward med school hopefuls. 

I live near a good community college and a four-year state school, so I can knock out some pre-reqs between them -- but you have any suggestions as to how I could get research experience? That was one of the primary motivations for me considering a formal post-bac, because it seems a daunting prospect to get research opportunities otherwise."
publichealth,"What's the typical work you do as a data analyst? "

publichealth,"What kind of consulting work do you do? Graduating from undergrad soon, and while I don't have a degree in public health I have research in health policy as a research assistant. Considering trying to get involved in this line of work before maybe an MPH. "
publichealth,"I wouldn’t consider what I do normal consulting work because it’s not like we’re hired by a company to fix a problem (usually). We are basically contracted by the government to run or evaluate a program. Most of the work we do is in Medicaid and Medicare. So it’s a lot of data management, learning and diffusion of best practices, project management, technical assistance etc. I like the content that I work on but the day to day stuff can be horribly mind numbing down here at the bottom. "
publichealth,"But great experience and happy I’ve stuck with it for 2+ years. I would HIGHLY recommend working before going back for a masters. I actually don’t even think MPH should be open for people right out of school imho. Feel free to PM me if you want more deets! "
publichealth,"Lol, I understand that feeling of mind numbing material, but you have to start somewhere I guess. How'd you get involved with that?"

publichealth,"That's perfectly fine! There are a lot of medical schools that also offer dual degree programs for public health.

If you want, you can go into a masters in public health with a concentration in environmental health science, simply because your biology background would be a really good way to help you understand what's going on in the field. Because of your biology degree, you could also go into other health professional schools as well. "
publichealth,"So to become an industrial hygienist, I'd have to get a masters in public health? If I got my masters, would I then apply for IH jobs or would I need further training and certification? 

Also would I be at a disadvantage for doing a masters in public health if I didn't major in public or environmental health/science in undergrad? "
publichealth,"I don't believe you'd be at a disadvantage for doing a masters in public health. If you're going into a field in say, environmental health, then a biology or chemistry background would be more than suitable.

However, for an industrial hygienist, you may want to get an additional graduate degree for chemistry. But it's just my opinion. You learn more about it here:

https://www.columbiasouthern.edu/how-to-become-certified-industrial-hygienist

Sorry, I just heard of industrial hygienist today. "
publichealth,"Most Industrial Hygienist have a MS instead of an MPH. Either way you will want to attend one that is ABET accredited. Yes after getting the masters you would apply for IH jobs.  You could apply now for tech level jobs and have some chance of landing one. But with funding available for maters degrees through NIOSH ERCs and the high employment rate of those with a MS getting one is a good choice especially with a biology undergrad. 

You would not be at a disadvantage IH masters programs are a mix of all sorts of undergrad degrees as most have not heard of IH till later on in schooling or having worked for awhile.  Having a biology degree you likely have the basic chem, bio, and physics background required for entry. 

"
publichealth,Following this because I’m in the same boat
publichealth,"In this study, researchers injected human neural stem cells into the developing brains of very early stage chicken embryos. They allowed these embryos to develop in the egg until they were five days old (which corresponds to approximately the equivalent of the end of the first human trimester of pregnancy), then treated the entire embryo with Zika virus by way of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), which corresponds to the human placenta. Interestingly, these “humanized” Zika-treated embryos developed severe microcephaly as well as dramatic brain and eye abnormalities, reminiscent of what is seen in human patients. Moreover, chicken embryos without human neurons did not develop these features indicating that these types of human xenograft models provide a very important tool for studying neurodevelopmental disorders and are essential for understanding why humans are so susceptible to certain diseases while other organisms are not. Lastly, we show that treatment with Niclosamide, a drug already used for treating tapeworm infestations, promotes embryo survival and causes reversal of Zika-induced microcephaly and brain defects in this humanized model. While vaccines for Zika are currently in development, an extensive amount of time is required to validate their efficacy and safety. There is an urgent need to treat potentially affected fetuses and prophylactically treat pregnant mothers in regions in which the potential exposure risk is very high. Given that Niclosamide is an FDA-approved drug and may not pose any fetal risk, this might be an appropriate standard of care until suitable vaccines have been thoroughly developed and tested."
publichealth,"Oh, my emphasis? Health Education/Health Behavior is just the departmental name at the campuses (not the same at at schools, but similar).

Question for anyone with this experience: I did not get into my first choice department at Emory and my application is now being reviewed by my second choice department. Has this happened to anyone else and how did it go? It feels a bit like a soft rejection! :("
publichealth,"With a bio degree you are on a great path to being an Environmental Health Scientist (health inspector).

publichealth,"Thanks for making this post! So far I’ve been accepted to Emory and the University of Louisville for epi and to Vanderbilt for health policy. Still waiting to hear back from a few of my state schools, but I think their admissions standards are pretty low.

I assumed going into all this that I’d end up at either Louisville or the University of Tennessee since they seem decent enough, offer in-state tuition, and are about three hours from Nashville where I live, but now that I’ve gotten into Vandy I am REALLY hoping for some funding. I love the program and would obviously prefer to stay in Nashville since my life, family, and career are already here. As I’ve said on SDN (with the same handle), waiting for financial aid info feels more stressful to me than waiting for acceptances."
publichealth,"The chemistry degree really isn't necessary. Yes, the field does require a decent amount of chemistry knowledge, but it would be more than covered in toxicology and in an IH fundamentals course. And most IH programs have previous chemistry coursework requirements for entering students.

If OP wanted to take an analytical chemistry course to supplement their knowledge (and understand the laboratory side of the field better), that may be worthwhile but it's not required."

publichealth,"Hey there! I have a B.S. in healthcare management and business administration from a small non- top 50 private university and recently applied and got accepted into some top MPH programs (Yale, GW, BU, UW)for health policy and management. What are your interests for public health vs. healthcare management with an MS?"
publichealth,"If you just want to get more biostatistics knowledge and decide you don't care about the in-person experience, an MPH seems like an expensive way to go. Have you looked at any certificate programs like [this one](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/applied-biostatistics) in Applied Biostatistics at the University of Washington? "
publichealth,"Sorry, I know this doesn't specifically respond to your question, but another option could be an MOH (Masters in Occupational Health) which can have a significant focus on biostats/occupational epidemiology. I went through my MSOH in industrial hygiene alongside a few clinicians pursuing their MOH and it seemed well liked."
publichealth,"I think most of us have a variety of undergrad degrees to go into public health. I don't think it matters as long as you know what direction you want to go in with your MPH. 

Picking a MPH specialty to study in would be important and maybe some more microbiology people can chime in on what that should be. I'd assume you'd want to go in either an epidemiology or environmental health direction? Wish I could help more. "
publichealth,"From working with physicians to do research I'd recommend more Epi programs than Biostats. A more applied stats program would more likely be of use than the theoretical stats with a biostats degree. Sadly, I don't personally know any epi online programs, but UNC has some online certificate programs in epi. "
publichealth,"Unless you’re interested in environmental health officer positions, or field epidemiology (which is really difficult to get a job in)."
publichealth,"You're right about them being quite expensive, which is why I'm trying to find a program that has good value for the money. I vaguely alluded to this in my post, but I'm considering moving into a public-health field in the future and having the MPH degree might help in that transition."
publichealth,I actually hadn't heard of those programs--what did the clinicians end up doing with the degree afterwards?
publichealth,"I believe the ones I knew went into medical practice at occupational health clinics, working with people involved in work related injuries. I don't know that any went into clinical research but I believe that's a path that can be chosen. If you're interested in researching the program, I went to the Rocky Mountain Center for Occupational and Environmental Health at the University of Utah. Its a NIOSH ERC so there is tuition assistance, and I believe that program is completed in 18 months."

publichealth,Whenever I try to have this discussion I try to pair it with this [town hall response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6imFvSua3Kg) that President Obama gave on the issue.
publichealth,"I honestly didn't know that people could get Bachelor's degrees in Public Health until I ran into a few after college. As I understand it, Health Promotion and Community Health Education are just similar subsets of Public Health, so go generalist maybe?

My 2 cents are that the specific undergrad degree plays a small role if you have a master's program in mind later on, so pick whichever. I would also suggest looking into other majors that give you skills that you will probably use in an MPH program, things like wet lab skills and quantitative skills."
publichealth,The second is correct. It is a common mistake with our degree to say “Master’s”
publichealth,"I haven’t found a job in the field yet, but it’s only been a couple of months. I moved to CA from CO, and don’t have a network here, and that’s made it very difficult. Wherever you end up, be sure to network a lot!

The only other schools I looked into were U of T in San Antonio and U of NC. UT was a lot less expensive, especially if you agree to work in TX after graduation for 4 years (I think it’s 4). The degree would have cost around $65K. U of NC is the #1 program in the US, so of course it costs more. 

I decided to stay in CO because my family lives there. If my family hadn’t been in CO and offered assistance, then I would have gone to U of T. I originally was accepted in to the Anschutz program, but moved to the program at UNC because Anschutz’s program is so big that I felt like a number. UNC’s is small, and was more welcoming. I’ve heard good things about the Ft Collins program, too. 

I hope this helps!"
publichealth,"It should say ""received a Master of Public Health (MPH) in 2015."" The ""degree"" is implied. If you had a specific concentration that is on your diploma, you could elaborate to say ""... (MPH) in [department/field] in 2015,"" which may sound less awkward."
publichealth,"Thank you, I'll probably go with this one. This *looks* correct but when said out loud I can't help but cringe because I would never say that. ""I have my master of Public Health"" just sounds bizarre. I would much more likely say ""I have my master's in public health."" I'll have to just get over it I suppose. "
publichealth,"Isnt it a tautology to say “I have my Master”.

“I have my mate Darren’s masters degree”"
publichealth,"True. I'd probably more likely say ""I have *a* master's"". However this whole process has just made me realize I really don't pay much attention to what the hell I'm saying when I discuss it. I hope that means I don't go around talking about my degree all that much. 

But I guess if I want to be a credible ""Master"" maybe I should know the proper semantics. "
publichealth,"My employer never asked about GPA and I did not include it in my resume. I've seen some jobs ask for a copy of the diploma though. "
publichealth,Thanks for the tip!
publichealth,"Hey - I definitely feel you! I work in health policy on federal and state contracts. I spent the first 2 years doing administrative and horribly boring work - or for months no work at all as there was no contract at my company for me to work on. Over 2 years at my job now and I finally am doing things I’m interested in on an extremely cool project and leading tasks. I know you want to do interesting stuff NOW but sometimes it’s best to stick it out. Your resume will look bad because you keep switching jobs. Maybe discuss with your supervisor other tasks or work steams you can work on and network within your company to find projects you can insert yourself with. Keep at it! It sucks but we all have to start at the bottom :) "
publichealth,[removed]
publichealth,The only thing to keep in mind is some programs make you retake classes if you get a C. Otherwise though IMO an MPH is so short that it's silly to nitpick GPA-like your could be a bit lower because one large question on one large exam confused you.
publichealth,"Most employers don't care about your GPA, but rather the skills you can demonstrate. *Some* might ask for transcripts to show that you have completed your degree and have taken some of the requisite coursework if specifically required for the job...though I would think this would be exceedingly rare.

Fellowships are likely to ask for transcripts, usually to verify you completed the degree, though."
publichealth,"If you're going to medical school, it doesn't actually matter and your in-state school will give you a great public health education that you can combine with your medical degree.  If you aren't going to medical school and the MPH is the degree you will be using to build a career, then I would say that it does matter and would recommend giving Columbia or BU more consideration."
publichealth,"I'm at YSPH but not in HPM. 

First of all, the single best thing you can do for yourself — if you can afford it — is to visit the school for admitted students' day (there are two this year, I forget when), so that you can talk to multiple current students and faculty.

Second, you will be getting some information from the school at some point soon(ish?) which should include contact information for a student ambassador, whose responsibility is to help with this kind of thing. Your student ambassador will be in HPM, so they can field departmental questions. (We changed how this information goes out this year, so I don't recall exactly when you'll be getting it.)

That said, I love YSPH and if you ask specific questions, I'll do my best to answer them. (Although for HPM-specific questions, I will refer you back to our admissions staff, who are incredibly lovely and helpful, and your student ambassador.)"
publichealth,"Awesome! Thanks for that info. I’m going to try my best to get there actually for the admissions day. I guess in weighing my options...

I’m looking for the perspective as a student in terms of why they chose Yale. The Ivy League factor of course is a plus, but I don’t think HPM is as well resourced as opposed to University of Washington, for instance (maybe even in Epi too). Do you find yourself, outside of the competencies, able to have ample research opportunities with faculty or centers through YSPH? Maybe this doesn’t apply to you specifically, but I know sometimes people say MPH’s are competitive wherever for jobs as long as it’s accredited. I haven’t received FA yet but how do you think Yale propels itself over other top Public Health programs when the cost is so high? What made it different for you is what I’m getting at...I think! Haha 

Thanks in advance!"

publichealth,"Congrats! What are you planning on specializing in for the M2? One thing that looks strange to me is the length of each course, they only seem to be a couple of weeks long. I worry about retaining information. But yes, I'd like to hear some personal experiences as well. Have you tried french forums?"
publichealth,"My advice: go into an MPH program and explore the topics more. Usually you end up finding a topic you really care about. I think Child and Maternal health is fascinating, but as soon as I started doing nutritional epidemiology with gestational factors affecting infants in an independent study, I didn't realize how much that field is not for me. It sounds like you are leaning more towards an environmental health side, which could be fascinating.  "
publichealth,Is there a data management informatics department at your hospital? Ask to meet with the director for an informational interview on how to approach the field. Doubles as a networking opportunity.
publichealth,"I would like to have some idea of what I want to study before starting an MPH program. Some schools have specialized tracks, like with Child and Maternal Health, which you would start your first semester.

And then of course if they are more interested in the environmental side of things, maybe an mph is not the right degree. something like forestry, appropriate technology, landscape design, etc. more of an emphasis on environment but still able to have a public health slant to it."
publichealth," I’m leaning towards epi. The class format is a little different. Ive done summer school uni classes that were like that and I found it really worked for me but I can see it being harder for some students. 

No luck on French forums either. The student experiences in the newsletter give a lot of insight, but again it’s a school affiliated site so it could be biased. "
publichealth,Could you tell me a little more about why and how it worked for you? I've only taken courses for full semesters and at the end of each course we have the exam

publichealth,"I think in general graduation statistics for public health can be super skewed because they include physicians who get an MPH too and that will skewed any data in regards to salary and employability post graduation. It's possible Columbia includes these types of MD/MPH students while Emory does not.


I would ask both schools if you can be put in contact with alumni from the programs and for the specific concentration you're looking at. Ask about overall satisfaction and how difficult they found job searching after graduation and if the school's alumni network helped them out in any particular way. I'm surprised about Emory too, you should follow up with career services or their alumni department about that!


I have a friend who went to Mailman and raves about her time there but when I spoke to a school ambassador I was quite unimpressed with the support they provide MPH students while still charging boatloads of money for the degree."

publichealth,Does anyone know if there are usually on campus recruitment events for target schools in the US and in Canada? What are they usually like?
publichealth,"Thank you for your answer! Columbia blew my mind, they broke everything down, separating all with other grad degrees and it still looked good! I'll definitely take your advice to gauge how individuals felt about the path they took"
publichealth,That’s not really a thing for public health like it is for other fields (business). Employers aren’t lining up to hire students from specific schools.
publichealth,Stay positive!  The other schools you've gotten into are wonderful choices as well!  Best of luck with the schools you are waiting on hearing from :)
publichealth,"Nice!  Congrats on those acceptances so far, and best of luck with the funding situation!!  I completely understand wanting to stay close to home, same situation for me.  Pretty sure I want to end up here in NorCal for my future career, so it makes sense to stay local for school and continue to build my network. 

Can I ask what SDN is?  Is that a separate subreddit?  "
publichealth,"Student Doctor Network. There’s a thread there where people post their stats, where they applied, acceptances, etc. I’ve found it very helpful! https://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/mph-fall-2018-applied-accepted-waitlisted-rejected.1274899/"
publichealth,"I'm also curious, finding a job has been challenging! "
publichealth,"Hi there 

I completed a joint MPH/MPA in Colorado and much of my coursework centered on health policy. I took a variety of classes from “democracy and the policy process” to “public health law and ethics” and I think it was a really insightful. I completed my capstone with a large nonprofit health system writing a policy white paper on the role of municipal broadband in expanding access to telehealth services. 

Throughout my degree I interned with the state’s Medicaid agency (many alums from my program worked there), completed a project with a local public health department (working on accreditation), and the fda (where I was being trained as a consumer safety officer). I said yes to every opportunity so I was kind of all over the place. 

After graduation I did a brief project where I helped out on a program evaluation and I currently work for a local public health department in Arizona. My job is in “strategic integration” which basically means I meet with key community partners, stakeholders, etc and see how the health department can work with them on various project. 

Hope that help, let me know if you have any questions. "
publichealth,Yes that was really insightful! It seems that this degree definitely gives you the ability to travel to different areas of the country to help you find employment. Thanks for the response! Would you say that it was important take implementation science based course? Health data analytics?
publichealth,"While those courses may not be necessary to complete your program, they definitely equip you with valuable tools that can be an asset. But it ultimately boils down to what you think is most  interesting and what you would like to do. 
An mph definitely gives you a range of skills that can be applied to a variety of contexts. I think it’s really important to have the understand of the broader public health system. 
My experience with the fda is a little bit of a departure from my other experience. The positions in the field as a CSO are definitely more geared toward environmental health or even health promotion.

publichealth,"I’m graduating with a MPH/MPA in May! I’m in NYC and have been working part-time with the Department of Health here in the city.  I’m specializing in epidemiology but the MPA portion of my degree covered a lot of health policy. 

For my capstone I worked with a local government agency to determine the gaps in addiction treatment services related to the opioid epidemic. After graduation I’ll spend the summer in Mozambique, in a project to expand the system of mental health care in the country.

Need to start looking for full time jobs soon!"
publichealth,"Ah, okay. I figured that a biology or chemistry background would help him in that sense. "
publichealth,"My program is set up to be two years of classroom education, and one year of a required fellowship/residency (which I personally think makes a lot of difference in terms of starting a career). I have taken one or two online classes though. My undergraduate degree was in international studies but I did have a pre-med background with volunteering/internships to reflect that. I did not have work experience beyond internship settings and summer jobs. It is not uncommon for individuals in my program to come from a clinical background and have years of work experience under their belt, and it is not uncommon for individuals to come straight from undergrad! It’s a diverse mix which I think is great. Let me know if I can be of any more help :-)"
publichealth,Removed as the URL is leading to a “Something has gone wrong...” page.
publichealth,I don't work for them but with them.  R and SAS are the analysis software they use.
publichealth,"Awesome, that's a start!"
publichealth,Thank you! Was having tech issues this morning. Apologies for the broken link.
publichealth,No problem! These things happen. Feel free to repost once a working link is available.
publichealth,"Graduated with MPH/MPP. Work on the Hill in DC now in health policy. Even if you don't plan to be a ""quantitative person"", take quantitative courses and challenge yourself to develop specific skills; its easy to float in MPH curricula. Read the news on health policy that interests you. 

Spent the summer beforehand in DC (GAO), and the summer before that in Ethiopia (tuberculosis/USAID). Have done a number of research things through my school and smaller jobs as well. Find opportunities that you think sound exciting and be open to new things. And network constantly wherever you are. Networking doesn't need to feel forced or awkward. Ask people you work with, or ask people you know to introduce you to people they work with, to get coffee (or alcohol depending on your relationship). Only ask when you feel excited about what you think they do (you may not want their job but you will never waste someone's time if you're genuinely interested in learning, imo). Ask them what they do and why and keep it light at first; you can always follow up more seriously later about jobs/resume/ etc. Always send a thank you.      "
publichealth,"Hi, u/mb349!

I'm at DOHMH right now and completing my MPH in Brooklyn this May as well. I'm also doing Epi work here (on the 7th floor). 

Just saying hi!"
publichealth,"Hi, u/jedrich728,

I'm completing my health policy / management MPH this May. Same, as u/mb349, I'm working as a paid intern at the NYC Department of Health. I'm finishing my thesis on federal policy about the opioid epidemic while working. I'm currently data science and epidemiology work. I don't want to be doing this, though.

I'm currently applying for jobs in healthcare management/healthcare/pharma consulting spaces. Private for sure. AMA."
publichealth,"Hi there! I believe I know which program you are mentioning since I work for that university and have been going back and forth on whether to enroll in this joint program, go for a single MPH, or go with the MSHA. 

Can I ask were you working a full time job while taking classes? Were you able to do most online? Also was the job market not that good in CO since you are in AZ? "
publichealth,"CU Denver? 
I was working between 25-30hrs a week throughout my program. It was a bit much at times but the MPA program is tailored to mid-career professional so many of the classes were offered in the evenings or online, which helped a great deal. I only took a few classes in the MPH program, largely because I wanted to ensure I got the most out of them. There were options to complete the bulk of the degree online, if not all of it, but i find that I learn a lot better in a classroom environment. 
As for the job market, I found that there were a lot of options. I could have stayed with the FDA (though at the end of the day, it wasn’t what I wanted to do) but being in Denver meant that there a lot of different opportunities. For instance both statewide agencies (CDPHE and HCPF) are located in the state capital, not to mention organizations like Kaiser Permanente or county departments. 
I opted to move back to Arizona for personal reasons, my family is here and my girlfriend found a great job before I graduated, not to mention the cost of living is much cheaper. Trying to find a job here was a little difficult because of the town I’m in is a little smaller but i was able to make it work. I think that’s part of the beauty of the mph, it gives you skills that can be used pretty much anywhere. "
publichealth,"Hi u/mb349! Thanks for the advice, I work in FiDi so not too far. I currently am weighing my options for schools. Where are you attending? I got into GW and University of Washington, except the UW is more health systems focused with a policy concentration and I believe GW in management. The other schools I have been accepted to is more community oriented and that’s not really my direction. Any advice there? I’m planning on visiting both schools, but i know DC is great for policy while UW has amazing resources for funding, research, etc. "
publichealth,"I myself am at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. It is nascent, growing, social-equity-focused school. GW and UoW are both probably stronger schools than my own, but it depends on what you want to do. So, that leads me to the question - what do you want to do career-wise and how do you expect your degree to help?"
publichealth,"Yep CU Denver, but work on the medical campus, full time. Thank you for your insight! It something I'll have to keep considering, but since I'm on the medical campus I'm leaning more towards MPH biostats/epi as data analysis fascinates me. On the flip side health care policy is very interesting as well. "
publichealth,"Right on, I worked in building 500 when I first started my program. Epi is such a cool field and so having that skill set is a huge asset when making evidence informed policy.  "
publichealth,"I'm in the exact same boat. I really want to get out of research but I haven't had any luck on leads.  This year, I'm focusing on working with mentors and networking. Basically anytime I meet someone who has a job I'm interested, I plan to ask them if we can get coffee and talk about their responsibilities, career path, and any advice they may have. As I meet people, I've asked a few if hey would be willing to be a mentor. I've already received some great advice and practical steps for changing my responsibilities. Maybe this would work for you too. "
publichealth,"Thanks for that information! I want to go into child health programs and development within health systems. Not so much at the community level, but more on the policy writing aspect and eventually into the management aspect. Implementation is important as well as data and the research that goes into it. "
publichealth,"Ok, that's good info. If you're looking to do 'policy writing,' you're likely looking at public sector. If you're looking to do 'management' and at times 'implementation,' you're looking at a mix of public and private. I think working in a local/state health department is always a great way to get your feet wet with policy/program planning. This is a route you should pursue no matter where you complete your degree. Your school should offer you avenues into working with the health department and that will be your jumping off point for your career."
publichealth,"The amount of money funding studies showing marijuana as good for your health is substantially larger than either unbiased studies or studies funded to show marijuana is bad for you. Therefore, just like the global warming studies, the outcome corresponds to how it was funded."
publichealth,"Hi back! "
publichealth,"That’s good advice from u/ysheth. I’m attending Columbia. "
publichealth,"Sorry to respond late. They're good about sending people but it's usually for something related to the job in some aspect. It wouldn't help me perform my job any better. I haven't brought it up at all yet.
