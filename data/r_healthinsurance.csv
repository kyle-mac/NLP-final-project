HealthInsurance,"With COBRA you're still following the same rules you had as an employee, so if the company only allows changes during open enrollment, you'd be locked in until open enrollment, at which point if you've got coverage across years, you can change plans."
HealthInsurance,"Yes, you can have two plans from the same insurance company. Sometimes though this can create confusion with the insurance company processing claims when a person has two policies with the same company, as the insurance plan can mix up the policy info in their system. As for which plan is primary for your kids, it goes by the birthday rule. It should follow the same order you had for your previous plans."
HealthInsurance,"Mostly likely, the cost of paying out of pocket for the appointment will be less than the cost of picking up a month of COBRA. Can't be sure, due to not knowing what tests they'll perform, etc. I would just do it though and pay out of pocket. You can negotiate the bill afterwards anyway, don't pay the ""total charge"". And like another poster advised, check Planned Parenthood."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;she is switching jobs and I am going to lose the health insurance in the next month or 2

mom won't have health coverage at new job?"
HealthInsurance,"Exactly, powerful psoriasis medication is ridiculously expensive for just about anyone without substantial assistance. I am checking on the centers and stuff though. Hopefully something pans out. I definitely know a little better in case it happens again but hopefully our healthcare and medication system just get fixed... Ha"
HealthInsurance,Are you telling us your employer has provided you ZERO info on how your spending account works?
HealthInsurance,"&gt;. Unfortunately the ACA made things location dependent so most answers you get will be general and not specific.

""All health coverage is local"" has been a thing since pretty much forever. 

Unfortunately for your assertion, if anything, ACA made plan designs &amp; eligibility options MORE uniform coast to coast, not less."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! I appreciate the info! "
HealthInsurance,"This.  Also, you'd be surprised how often this happens\- coding mistakes are common.  I examine all of my medical bills, even if they initially appear to be correct for this reason"
HealthInsurance,"On a positive note, it sounds like you qualify now based off your income, 

I would reach out and try to find some local resources. Even if you find a community counselor, talking with someone who cares beats no one.  "
HealthInsurance,Not the place for it. There are plenty other subs for that.
HealthInsurance,"So they have been contacting me nonstop since about 5 min after I tweeted... I don’t think they’re teaching me the lesson they’d want me to learn, because now I know that while they ignore most else they do notice public shaming &amp; have given me that tool (which I’ll strive to use judiciously - I’d have to be a lot more clever &amp; succinct for frequent social media rants to look cute on me). Though with all this contact, they can’t get their website to work (so I can’t see old info or submit new out of network claims) and keep trying to explain what a deductible is to me, when my real question is about trying to understand how they define and calculate the “acceptable amount” of out of pocket costs that they’ll let be applied to my deductible... So no progress &amp; no clarity - but at least they’re communicating instead of hanging up on me...? ����‍♀️ (Also the donut, in a ziplock bag, is still on my counter - we’ll see how work today, including trip planning, records requests and a lot of invoicing, goes... ��)"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  *I use Medicaid to mean either Medicaid or Medicare since I don't really get which one is correct in context.

Yeah, don't do that. They are two wildly different things and details absolutely matter.

The correct order of payors for her situation would be her group health plan and then Medicare.

https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/02179-Medicare-Coordination-Benefits-Payer.pdf"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, it's an entry-level position but I think they're going to move me to another position soon. I understand I need to put my time in and work my way up. It's not the company's fault that Healthcare is so expensive. Right now my wife and I are on medically needy Medicaid and our children have Medicaid so I'll probably just leave it at that. It's not ideal but I really can't complain since so many others don't have anything at all. Thank you for taking the time to share your knowledge on the subject!"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"It doesn't say anything of the sort, and from what I remember when signing up, I'm pretty sure they weren't covering anything. I just know I selected the bare bones crappy minimum knowing I was basically paying to not have to pay the penalty, but also to not have an exorbitant insurance cost. 

I was a contracted employee for a major corporation, and the contracting agency I was hired for was who actually signed the checks and offered the health insurance. "
HealthInsurance,"That's a good question, I would say that with the right catastrophic plan, it could include any true medical emergency, such as appendicitis, but not going to the ER for a headache, persay. I would contact a local insurance broker and see what they can find for you, there's no charge and they're good at what they do. (Most of them, anyways. :) )"
HealthInsurance,"/u/HiGloss is incorrect. You don't have to worry about pre-existing conditions at all, even if you did have a lapse in coverage. 

You shouldn't have an issue with this."
HealthInsurance,"Since your midwife is OON , the insurance is paying what they call ‘usual and customary’. You may be able to get them to pay more by calling the insurance and telling them you are being billed the balance, which she is allowed to do. Sometimes they will adjust the payment. "
HealthInsurance,"Rhetorical question - is the allowed amount crazy low or is the amount billed crazy high?

Allowed amounts tend to be based on what Medicare allowed. "
HealthInsurance,It depends on the state and how health you are... what state are you in?
HealthInsurance,"Insurers don't ""decide"" to be primary or not.  There is a set of rules that dictates which plan is primary over another that all insurers must follow.

The key word in the ""working spouse rule"" is ""working.""  Generally any coverage one has through their own employer is going to be primary.  But your spouse isn't covered by their employer.  Your spouse is covered as a ""child"" dependent (""child"" in quotes because even though  she is a legal adult, she is a ""child"" under her parent's coverage).""  And she is a spouse dependent under your coverage.  She has no ""working"" coverage.

Being that she is a covered dependent under both policies and not an employee, the coverage that has been in effect the longest is primary.  This is likely her parent's coverage.  She should contact her insurer to make sure it is understood her other coverage (through you) is as a dependent and not an employee.

HealthInsurance,This generic may not be a “preferred” generic. Sometimes the companies of generic drugs increase their prices over time. There may be a new generic or a cheaper generic available so this drug got bumped to non preferred.
HealthInsurance,"Have you tried the Healthy Michigan Plan? It's the state medicaid program.

Edit: Medicaid "
HealthInsurance,"I am not sure if you would qualify for medicaid in NH but please just take what i am about to say knowing i am completely unfamiliar with NH and this is just with some quick googling. 

NH allows 138% of the federal poverty level to be eligible for benefits. Thats roughly $16500 yearly income. If you were working full time @ $9/hour that would put you above that number. I also found [this](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/medicaid/386566-new-hampshire-wins-approval-to-imose-medicaid-work-requirements:) article that goes over the work/community service requirements that were just passed. Not sure if they would already be implementing that or not though. 

All that being said, it never hurts to just go apply. You never know until you try. "
HealthInsurance,"So now I have to cancel the kids private health insurance and bring them onto Employer B's plan but only THEM, not to include me.

Can this be done in TX?

Feels like this is mainly a matter of your QDRO. Not sure there's an ***obligation*** to cover kids on your employer\-sponsored coverage; court and/or your ex should mainly be interested in having kids covered by adequate insurance. That said, TX may be the most backward state in the nation when it comes to health insurance, whether individual OR group ""flavors"". Semi\-ironic since it's generally regarded as the state where US health insurance was ""invented"""
HealthInsurance,"It is BS but they call open enrollment(Which is intentionally short I think) insurance against people getting insurance right before they get sick, aka, on the way to the hospital... We need single payor and to get on with this shit. "
HealthInsurance,"You don't typically get a choice of who gets billed first (i.e. your primary insurance).  If either of these plans is in your name (as opposed to a parent's or spouse's name), it's probably your primary.  But calling to check is always a good idea.

Random side note: are both of your plans high deductible (i.e. HDHP) plans?  The IRS mandates that if you are covered by one HDHP plan, any secondary insurance you have must also be an HDHP plan.  Could be an issue when it comes time to file your taxes"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah,  OP needs learn the difference, because it's SERIOUS.

Medicaid is provided by your state to people with sufficiently low income and children, and pretty much every state considers their Medicaid to be the *payer of last resort*, that is, if *anyone* else can pay for it, they must be billed first before a provider can bill Medicaid.  NC didn't expand Medicaid coverage, so since you have a job and she owns a company, she almost certainly doesn't qualify. Even if she did qualify, it would come after Medicare.

Medicare is run by the federal government and is available to patients above a certain age, **patients who are disabled**, and a certain number of other situations.  Medicare has several parts, and there are three parts relevant here: Part B (which covers all outpatient care and some hospital care) *and* Part D (which covers drugs and is ***sold separately***), *or* Part C (aka Medicare Advantage, sold by various companies), which may include its own drug coverage, or you may still need to get a Part D plan.

TL;DR: Get drug coverage https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/get-drug-coverage/get-drug-coverage.html"
HealthInsurance,"Yes, co-insurance is the amount that you are responsible for, so once you're deductible is met, you would be responsible for 50%. However, if you're deductible has not been met, then you are responsible for 100%. However, remember that the 50% and 100% is of the contracted negotiated rate, NOT what the actual charge is. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes, it's possible. Due to the ACA, pre-existing conditions are no longer a ""thing"". However, you have to wait for open enrollment (Usually from Nov-Dec) OR you have to have a ""life changing event"" in order to apply for health insurance before open enrollment. "
HealthInsurance,"A zero deductible plan, covered prescriptions, etc. is in cadillac insurance territory. For instance, my work insurance is ~200/month for a 2,000 deductible, 4,000 out-of-pocket max, an copays for things like visits, meds, etc. That being said sounds like you don't need such fancy coverage and would be fine with a higher deductible. On the marketplace for me though, it is 330/month for 6,800 deductible insurance so you may not get a great cheap but mid deductible option"
HealthInsurance,"Depending on the household income, your daughter may very well still be covered under AHCCCS. "
HealthInsurance,"If it was unpaid, then it would count towards her average for the week, so it doesn't seem to me that they are trying to snowball her, that week is what prevented the 35 hours for the year. "
HealthInsurance,"This shouldn't be a difficult fix. Call the insurance company, HR, any manager in your own company.

Don't stop until someone helps you. Even if they refuse, you should at least say you are in the COBRA period.

FYI, people get added late all the time. "
HealthInsurance,I just turned 26 and went through this. Have her ask her employer if they consider loss of coverage a qualifying change. If they do she doesn't need to sign up at open enrollment she can sign up when she loses coverage. All I needed was a letter with my policy end date and I was signed up for the company insurance within a week. Saved me 6 months of paying for insurance!
HealthInsurance,"So they give you tax credits depending on your income. Let's say a plan is $500 a month and they give you a tax credit of $450. That means that you will only have to pay $50 a month. This is just an example but the tax credit will be the same, no matter the insurance you pick. What varies are the prices for each plan. You will find out what tax credit you get once you complete your application. 

Something to consider is this, if you end up getting insurance through the marketplace make sure to to change your income if it goes up. If you end up making more then predicted you will owe back some of those tax credits. I hope that makes sense. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I'm curious if anyone has put any thought into actually making it good?

Stuff labled health care"" accounts for 1/6th of the US economy, &amp; climbing. Health insurance is a portion of that slice, and is often blamed \- and sometimes applauded \- for making that slice as large as it is  these days.

So yeah, ""anyone"" \- lots of anyones \- have put thought into ""making it good"".

But health insurance in the US began life with the financial risks of faced by care providers \- particularly hospitals \- foremost. That circumstance may or may not have been inevitable; it may also partly explain why health insurance in the US is how it is .

Regarding your own idea, really smart people, among them Paul Ellwood \(hmmm \- apparently a URL ending in a ""."" is ok with Wikipedia, but not with reddit:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul\_M.\_Ellwood\_Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_M._Ellwood_Jr).\), have worked really hard to make Health Maintenance Organizations \- HMOs \- of the type you describe work well, since at least the 1970s \(the date depends on how you score/give credit for introduction of innovative ideas\). 

And in fact they have worked well, where they have worked well; Kaiser in CA, Geisinger in PA, other HMOs in other places.  They've also fared poorly in other places &amp; times. Nothing is THE answer."
HealthInsurance,It is my understanding that the surgery would offset him for about 4\-6 months which would put him on disability and under these circumstances he will NOT get complete coverage from his employer
HealthInsurance,"thanks for this helpful reply.  (i find your reply condescending and unhelpful).  but now that i'm back here, thank you for the original reply!!!  clarity.   reporting on this issue has been muddled bc the last big story was about speculation of the effects of short term plans"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you so much. Seriously this is appreciated. She’s really really nervous and Google just made me confused when trying to sort through all of it. "
HealthInsurance,"other way round. because of the court order that i supply health insurance and have done with employer A a the time of my divorce I need coverage for them from employter B but for them ONLY, not to include me on the plan since I have my own elsewhere."
HealthInsurance,She tried CBD and liked it... but not enough to justify the cost.
HealthInsurance,I did and all they can offer are HMO plans. I really need PPO
HealthInsurance,"I'd do the HSA. You're healthy, aren't on meds currently, and $1400 deductible isn't much in the scheme of things anyway. Really only $1000 given the difference in the classic vs HSA premium. 

I also love the HSA because it's a triple tax advantage account which you can contribute to $3400 a year and invest. "
HealthInsurance,feels like you need to share a little more about what your question is
HealthInsurance,"This. The only way I can think of is if you were his legal guardian. If your dad lost his insurance, you have a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchange."
HealthInsurance,"You would just cancel it. Then you apply for it in the new state you live in. You will meet the special enrollment period since you just moved. "
HealthInsurance,"Technically, correct, but there are always cases where your primary may see the other coverage and unless they are notified of being primary SPECIFICALLY they may try to pull the old ""Let's put all claims in pending status until we actually get clarification from the member"" trick. I say contact both just to make sure everyone knows their positions. Your work place is primary and your parent's is secondary. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I don't make enough to get Medicaid

hmmm.... maybe ""you make too much to qualify for Medicaid?"""
HealthInsurance,"And this is why we highly recommend putting a flag on your calendar to ensure your auto payment goes through. This happens way too often. 

Generally though they're required to give 30 days notice of cancellation. Are you sure she didn't receive anything in the mail?"
HealthInsurance,"You need an advocate. Healthcare is not easy to navigate and very frustrating as you well know.

Although you don't qualify for medicaid, I would still reach out and ask if they have any local community resources you can call for help.

I agree the system can feel broken. Glass half full, there are people in your community willing to help. "
HealthInsurance,"As annamolly said you have the gist of HMOs. But keep in mind that HMOs are bundles of contractual arrangements, and you can find variations on these operational themes from one organization to another. For instance some organizations are sticklers for whacking participating clinicians in the event they ""mis\-refer"" members to non\-network service providers; others are more ""forgiving"" \(less disciplined/less customer\-sensitive\)"
HealthInsurance,"Emphatic 2nd for IceT's advice. Short\-term coverage is a 2nd best fallback for you, coverage wise and inconvenience wise. Try [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) again, &amp; be sure they understand you want to file an appeal if  the 1st line reps you talk to try to dismiss your case."
HealthInsurance,"The main issue with getting it through the exchange is needing to file in advance, since coverage begins the 1st of the month after you enroll, so if you wait until the month you leave this job, you might be working at the next job before it kicks in.

EDIT: As part of your decision, you need to make sure your new employer offers coverage right away, not after whatever probation period."
HealthInsurance,What med? There might be an option to go through the manufacturer
HealthInsurance,"1. Nope
2. No because it's under 50 employees so rates are not affected 
3. Insurance company will always have these records "
HealthInsurance,"Ohhh duh. Sorry been a long day! Thought that said country... not county. Was super confused. Lol. 

To be honest... the only way they could find out that you’ve moved out of the county is if you have mail returned to them or if you specifically tell them. I work a lot with insurance and patients always seem to have inaccurate info on file with the insurance company or the providers office. I wouldn’t worry about it. "
HealthInsurance,"When i was in my 20s i had the situation but it was teeth. I got cobra just to fix my teeth it was so stupid it cost me 176 a month for a year.

I should of just paid out of pocket. It would of cost me 150 for a filling. I didny know you could go to doctor without health insurance.

What you gotta do is find a government run hospital and visit their ENT. If you have low income yoh should be good.

Or if you go to some ENT specialist talk to them tell them your case and negotiate. They might charge you $300.

One time i went to an emergency ENT they billed me 10k i got it down to $500. Our health care system is stupid. Why they cant bill honestly. But i dont want to go on a rant.
"
HealthInsurance,"Did they drop your coverage? "
HealthInsurance,"That is what the representative on the phone said. She could be wrong, I wouldn't put it past here."
HealthInsurance,Thank you so much
HealthInsurance,"Please be constructive when you post here. This is a place for advice, not politics."
HealthInsurance,You’ll probably get billed for it being a non-emergency assuming claims are auto-adjudicated at that level (and depending on the carrier) but you can appeal and probably get the additional charges written off.
HealthInsurance,Good luck to you and wish you a quick recovery.
HealthInsurance,"Sorry for the delayed reply!

They actually called me the other day and said they spoke with my insurance and everything will be covered (whew!) They are going to call when my shots are ready so I can get started! They are also trying to work out a CT scan with my insurance, but I'm a little worried that by the time they get it sorted out, I'll be off this insurance. Fingers crossed though!"
HealthInsurance,"you can always go through the marketplace, you may qualify for special enrollment since you are losing coverage. You can go to healthsherpa.com or healthcoverage.gov"
HealthInsurance,"Hi, you will definitely have another time to enroll. Depending on the insurer and the employer the dates will vary. 

You only have to pay for the months that you did not have any coverage. "
HealthInsurance,"This isn't necessarily true, definitely need to call and ask before getting your hopes up. I'm over 18, on parents' insurance, but can't even see the benefits, deductibles, claims, etc. They said it's because I'm on their insurance and it's extremely hard to use... and no way I could ever hide something from them."
HealthInsurance,"Entyvio. The copay program rep said the insurance or PBM is doing it wrong. Said we need to provide the EOBs showing reversals and they will fix it. There's a way to do it which will give us the proper credit--the insurance/PBM are trying to work things to their advantage, inappropriately if not illegally. This is intended as a *patient* assistance, not a PBM rebate. More info here: https://patientsrising.org/they-are-coming-after-your-copay-assistance/

I'll update after this sorts out, one way or the other. I will likely be reporting this to my states insurance commission also."
HealthInsurance,"So I wanted to be sure I was giving you correct advice so I reached out to someone at a local organization that exclusively works with Marketplace/healthcare and immigration.

&amp;nbsp;

Your wife will likely have to wait until she has her visa to apply for coverage.  The only other possibility would be if you have any of these documents (https://www.healthcare.gov/help/immigration-document-types/) AND you have mail being sent to your new Virginia residence.  The person with whom I spoke actually suggested going ahead and having some kind of “official” mail sent to your new address anyway, so you can prove where you will be moving to. Here's a list of acceptable documents: https://www.healthcare.gov/help/prove-move/


&amp;nbsp;

Also, you may have to wait until the move to apply for yourself as well, unless you have had another event that also qualifies for a special enrollment period.  You can see a list of eligible events here: https://www.healthcare.gov/screener/marketplace.html#

&amp;nbsp;

 
The problem is that your Marketplace coverage does not become effective immediately.  If you apply and pay your first premium in the first 15 days of the month, your coverage will become active on the 1st day of the following month (e.g., apply July 1, and your coverage will become active on August 1).  If you apply in the latter 15 days, it won’t become active until the month following the next (e.g., apply July 16, and coverage won’t be active until September 1).  

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, this means you could both end up with a gap in coverage.  It may be a good idea to look into finding what’s called a Federally Qualified Health Center (or some states call them Community Health Centers).  They typically steeply discounted (if not free) rates based on household size and income.  Here you can search the ones located in Virginia: https://vacommunityhealth.org/about-chcs/locations/

&amp;nbsp;

Similarly, should there be an emergency, most hospitals offer financial assistance as well, which can be more generous than most people think.  

&amp;nbsp;

The person with whom I spoke also wanted me to remind you to definitely file taxes next year, as you will likely be eligible for tax credits/cost-sharing assistance, and filing taxes is how the government reconciles these subsidies (ie, makes sure your income reported on your taxes matches that which you entered when applying for Marketplace coverage).  

&amp;nbsp;

I hope that is a least a little more clear than mud - let me know if you have any questions!  You can also reach out to a Marketplace certified application counselor if you want to know more about the plans specific to your area.  You can find one in your area here: https://localhelp.healthcare.gov/#/"
HealthInsurance,PPO
HealthInsurance,"Haha, yes that's me being extremely generous. Especially in America!  "
HealthInsurance,"It's an exclusion and simply won't be covered even with an appeal. Try talking to your employer/human resources to see if they can make an exception and allow for the coverage. The insurance company will follow the plan the way it is written however. You don't qualify and it will not be covered. "
HealthInsurance,formulae for computing service for the purpose of determining benefits eligiblity can be...quirky. Try to make sure the method used to compute your wife's service time is EXACTLY the same as is used for ANY OTHER employee.
HealthInsurance,"Really?! I had no idea! I wish they had all this laid out in a simpler matter. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;The penalty or how strictly it's enforced I don't know. 

Very little if anything in the way of obligatory penalty, if it comes to that. Though fines MAY be imposed, typically a reinstatement of coverage is about  all that happens. The administrative outs &amp; excuses employers and/or administrators may claim are numerous, and fairly generous"
HealthInsurance,Then maybe that is your premium! If so I’d keep it!
HealthInsurance,"&gt; honestly don't know if there's some sort of shared blacklist of people who were once denied somewhere that other companies would have access to. 

They'd cringe at being described as a ""blacklist"", but have a gander at the ""mission statement"" of [MIB Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIB_Group), which has been around for over a century"
HealthInsurance,"another former Cigna employee here, and I also know this program really well, but from the patient side of things.  I had a case manager while going through a stem cell transplant, and highly recommend it.  

Even though I knew a lot about the system, it was still helpful to have an advocate that could actually get things done.  They do a lot to make sure everything goes smoothly with authorizations and claim payment during a time when all your focus should be on getting healthy."
HealthInsurance,"Yep. I think you will have to submit them by mail, but I’m not positive. Again, I’d really recommend getting a Marketplace Navigator to help, because you’re going to want to appeal and that needs to be worded in a certain way!"
HealthInsurance,Oh ok. I kinda figured that but I wasn’t sure. Thanks for replying!
HealthInsurance,"Stay in network, and you'll be fine, there is NO such thing as pre-existing conditions at this time. Heck, you can even go out of network, if you have out of network benefits, but people usually only do that when they absolutely love their providers and refuse to go anywhere else. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Medicaid pregnancy

Yep, I believe its MPE or Moms and Babies are the two plans. No Co-Pay or premiums. "
HealthInsurance,"So, from what you've written it sounds like they are actively working on your claims now, as you even typed this up. I would wait one day, then call the insurance company directly, and explain to them what you told us and see what their response is, then get back to us with more details, if needed. "
HealthInsurance,"You're doing the right thing! I deal with health insurance related problems every day. Believe me, there are people in your community who want to help, but asking these questions ahead of time is very responsible. Wishing you and your family nothing but the best of luck!"
HealthInsurance,Please be constructive. The goal here is to help people with their circumstances. Purely political statements don't contribute to that goal.
HealthInsurance,Prices haven't skyrocketed yet?
HealthInsurance,"Have her check again with her company. Regardless of their typical open enrollment  period they should enroll people as necessary due to qualifying events, like being dropped from your policy at age 26. It's handled the same way they would handle a new employee, new spouse or new child.  "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I am a housewife married to an electronic and telecommunications engineer, he's also a network engineer.    

Does his employer offer health insurance?  
If not, or if he is an independent contractor then you need to visit healthcare.gov and fill out the forms.   

&gt;One very specific question I have is if the estimated premium (I'm learning health insurance vocabulary, yay!) I see online is what we will have to pay per person, or if it's per household.     

Depends on whether you checked ""Individual""  or ""Family"" when you answered the initial questions earlier on. If you said ""Family"" it is for all of you."
HealthInsurance,"I'm thinking about dropping it. I'm only paying a little more than $5 for it. My employer only takes out for vision and dental every other paycheck. (its a state job) "
HealthInsurance,Call a health insurance broker.
HealthInsurance,"&gt; im paying $150 a month for 0% coverage until I spend $3000 then they cover 80%

That's a pretty okay plan. Also, it's not 0% coverage. It's 0% cost share with the insurance. You are covered and receive all the benefits of being on the plan from day 1. 

You cannot enroll in a marketplace plan outside of open enrollment unless you have a qualifying life event. Open enrollment will be in November, but the birth of your child could open a special enrollment period for you. 

However, you won't get any credits/subsidies on the marketplace because you have employer insurance offered to you. So you're probably going to be shocked by the prices you see there. 

As to whether you can add your stepson and fiancee, that is largely dependent on your company. They can be added no issue (assuming your company allows dependents to enroll) if you're married, and may allow it prior to marriage, but you'd have to see what your company allows. 

&gt;  I need a health insurance that won't make me not go to the doctors ever. 

Insurance isn't preventing you from going to the doctor. You have a yearly physical covered at no cost to you each year. Further, if you are looking for something like a copay structure, you're likely going to pay more in premiums each month. So say your premium goes to $300 a month with a $20 copay for a doctor visit. You're paying $300 * 12 + 20 = $3620 for the year. Say it costs $150 on your current plan. You'd pay $150 * 12 + $150 = $1950. 

Consider your yearlong expenditure. "
HealthInsurance,No problem! Why would you know if you've never worn contacts before? :)
HealthInsurance,"I hear you - have been going in circles with them since I turned 18, including a year or so, post 2009, with Aetna when they seemed to only want to handle things by fax (never phone, internet or even some things couldn’t be done by mail). Post 2009 - I hadn’t had a land line in years and could never get that fax by computer thing to work. Thank goodness my apartment complex office had some great people working there who let me use their machine and hang out while I waited for confirmation &amp; replies! Even ended up hearing some cool old stories about my new city #silverlining. But yeah - if this was truly a free market where we could shop for options and not a few companies that our employers pick I think a lot of this would change or companies would be going under as people fled them..."
HealthInsurance,"Generally, dependents over 16 can ask their insurance carrier to remove claims access from the subscriber’s account (in this case, your parent). They will still see that you filled prescriptions, but not what your filled. Call the customer service number on the back of your insurance card and ask."
HealthInsurance,"Do you have any out of network benefits? (Even having typed that, Cigna is notorious for not having any OON benefits, because they want you to see their providers). I would say, you're pretty lucky to even have gotten your medication management sessions approved. So, if they're willing to give you that then I would take it and find someone in network for the psychotherapy sessions. Can you fight it? Sure, you always have the right to appeals, and really, what could it hurt? Since you've already been approved for the medication managment sessions, I really don't think it's something they would/could take away from you for appealing their decision regarding psychotherapy sessions, but because of what I know about Cigna, I would be happy with what they gave me and go somewhere in network for the other sessions.  (Personally)"
HealthInsurance,"Well, I've done it, even with having glasses. Especially if they won't pay for new ones every year. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Zofran for instance has a quantity / month limit usually

Zofran's authorization sheet reads like [""how many different chemotherapy drugs are you taking this week and have you tried *ALL* of these 20 other drugs first?""](https://professionals.optumrx.com/content/dam/optum3/professional-optumrx/resources/pdfs/partd/Zofran-ondansetron-Zuplenz.pdf) 

I know there's been a push in the pain med field to encourage doctors to not prescribe pain meds as a first-line treatment.  I haven't seen anything about this for nausea meds though."
HealthInsurance,"So I need to notify my secondary policy but not my primary, correct?"
HealthInsurance,"IceT is on to it. Post a \(de\-identified if you want, but you aren't obliged to\) copy of your Summary of Benefits and Coverage \(SBC\). [It looks like this](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf), and your employer or insurer is obliged to provide it to you. Frankly, it's made for sharing, tho startlingly few people share it. It's useful for lots of things, including sorting out what's going on with a plan's benefit provisions."
HealthInsurance,"This could work. Call the insurance company and explain what her services were . Maybe they will pay more.  I know my company seems to only pay half of what is billed and your lady should maybe start billing 2x as much. "
HealthInsurance,"It supposedly doesn't apply to tri care which is military insurance. I've also heard that if I apply as single, I will be required to make him pay child support, but not sure about the truth of that. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes, sorry, that’s what I meant: I make too much to qualify for Medicaid. :) "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you SO MUCH for your reply! :\) I love your username, I have a craving for iced tea now!

I looked on the Ambetter website and it looks like my hospital isn't covered at all.

But that's really good to know about the hospitals being covered, even if they say they're not on [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov)'s website. That's honestly one of the things that's setting my anxiety off, if the hospital itself isn't covered. But guess I should double\-check the insurance websites then... :\)

Another question: what does ""coinsurance"" mean? Like if I need to go the ER and they say the cost is ""50&amp;#37; Coinsurance after deductible,"" does that mean I and the insurance both pay 50&amp;#37; after my deductible is met?"
HealthInsurance,"Not yet. As of now there are no pre-existing condition limitations. Every 35 year old in your zipcode pays the same rate for the same plan, regardless of health conditions."
HealthInsurance,"I actually work in health insurance (tech) and overheard a high level conversation recently. They're really trying to come up with innovative ways to save people and then themselves, by proxy, money. 

As someone mentioned, obviously the bigger picture is actually the cost of the care.. which we technically just pass along. In our specific company our admin costs are less than 1%.. But I'm asking specifically how can healthcare help.

We do offer discounts and refunds for gyms, etc to healthier members.. quitting smoking.. etc. 

But as everyone knows the only way to make it even close to affordable.. we need to spread the risk.. across the populus.. the fatties and marathon runners alike.

I have been toying with the closed system model in my head for a little while.. people would need to be willing to accept that insanely pricy name brand drugs and experimental procedures, etc just wouldn't be covered.. but I think people would be ok with it if they knew it up front.. but there are laws against excluding almost anyone. "
HealthInsurance,"When you remember let me know, I would still only play by the book.  [More Info](https://www.healthcare.gov/income-and-household-information/income/)"
HealthInsurance,Unpaid. Probably why they can factor it into her hours.
HealthInsurance,"I agree that it is incredible how high costs are in healthcare and health insurance.  One thing to keep in mind if you were considering a marketplace plan with a subsidy. While an employer plan usually would make you ineligible for an advance premium tax credit \(subsidy\) for you and anyone in your tax household, there is an exception that would allow you to get a subsidy if the employer plan offered to you is not affordable. Affordability is a term of art and here's a brief description of how affordability is determined:  
[https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/affordable\-coverage/](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/affordable-coverage/)  
The key to remember is that they determine affordability only based on what the cost is for coverage for you only regardless of how much it is for the rest of the family and if the plan is affordable for you only and the employer offers coverage to the other family members \(regardless of the cost\), it will make everyone else in your tax household no longer eligible for a subsidy \(this is known as the ""family glitch""\).  


An employer plan is almost always the best option though. I hope they offer you a better deal soon!"
HealthInsurance,"Sorry for the delay. In my experience, you can elect even if something happens. You have 60 days, how are you to know if something would happen, you know? I would double and triple check they can't catch you with a ""pre-existing condition"" type of thing, but it might be worth looking into. Even if you get a minor sickness, it might be worth just paying for a visit instead of the COBRA premium, as they are $$$. Would love to hear how you make out. :) "
HealthInsurance,"I see, that I can't help you with. I used to bill for a psychiatrist, and she was not an MD, but I would still have problems getting her paid, so it's all insurance company based. If Cigna says no MD's, then you have to go to a PHD. "
HealthInsurance,"I can’t see a way in which this would work. Pre-existing condition limitations affected things that could and would normally be covered under the plan _already_. PCLs were in place to prevent people from suddenly jumping on insurance upon finding out they had a problem, but the benefit in question was still already an inherent component of the plan. If it’s not covered, it’s not covered. Though much more rare these days, there are plans that still don’t cover bariatric surgery, for instance. Trying to claim PCL wouldn’t work vía already being obese wouldn’t work because you yourself are not being discriminated against. It’s just not a benefit.

Is your plan through your work? Because if so, that’s who decided to not cover breast reduction."
HealthInsurance,"Your doctor and insurance company cannot reveal this information to your employer.  It would be a violation for HIPPA.

You would need to check your formulary to see if Viagra is covered.  More in likely, it or a generic of it will be covered."
HealthInsurance,"So in order to qualify for a catastrophic plan outside of open enrollment, I would need a hardship exemption, correct? The same hardship exemption which would waive the penalty for not having health insurance? Would I be eligible for that if my life event occurred 6 months ago, as opposed to 60 days? [Healthcare.gov](https://Healthcare.gov) says the life event could occur within the last 3 years, but I'm surprised the standards are different than they are with open enrollment.

I'll go down this route and see where it takes me. Thanks for your response."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;should I just get an ACA plan for that gap period?

Basically this. Given the price of your medication, I'd say opting for a month of coverage under a plan with lowish  Rx out\-of\-pocket outlays \(deductible; copays\) would still be a bargain in your situation"
HealthInsurance,"Awesome rant.

If it's any consolation, insurers have not really improved much over several decades. Source: have combatted/endured/railed at insurers in a professional capacity for several decades.

There's a reason insurers rank somewhere below used car dealers  in the public's esteem. Several in fact"
HealthInsurance,"This. There was a time when I was making too much to be on medical assistance, but I wasn't making enough to afford insurance. I ended up going uninsured for a few years, but my kids always had coverage. "
HealthInsurance,"Sorry, I wasn’t trying to be insensitive. "
HealthInsurance,"First, without a subsidy, you would have a $7k individual deductible. Individual deductibles can't exceed $7350 in 2018 \(I know you said for you and your spouse, but the distinction is important\). The only way you would get to $14k would be if you both have major medical events and/or a relatively expensive ongoing condition.   


If you entered your income at 22k, then you're below the eligibility for free or near free coverage from Medicaid \(if your state expanded medicaid\). If you were to estimate a little higher, at say 23,000, then your  deductibles and max out of pocket would only be that high for bronze plans and your premium would be very low regardless . So long as you don't have an employer plan and are otherwise eligible for an advance premium tax credit, you would get cost sharing reductions that would signficiantly reduce those out of pocket costs for silver plans. For example, here is the lowest cost silver plan in Indianapolis, for a married couple who are both 40 years old, non\-smoking and estimating $23k in income:   
[Ambetter From MHS · Ambetter Balanced Care 5 \(2018\) ](https://go.hc.gov/2xoINKA) \( [https://go.hc.gov/2xoINKA](https://go.hc.gov/2xoINKA) \)

**$67.71** /monthly premium

 Deductible

**$675** Individual Total 

 Out\-of\-pocket maximum

**$675** Individual Total 

This is a great plan that is very inexpensive with very low out of pocket costs \(a much better deal than most employer plans\).   


Now, I do agree with your general point that further healthcare reform is needed and it should be available to everyone, but in case your person with $22k income and $14k deductible was a real scenario, know that that your real or hypothetical person is actually in the best possible situation: either free/near free coverage via medicaid if in an expansion state or an excellent plan at a very low premium via the Marketplace."
HealthInsurance,"Your information is accurate, in my state, anyway, on both counts."
HealthInsurance,"Google Teladoc and call them. More than likely they can write you a script and it will cost you maybe $40 for the virtual visit "
HealthInsurance,"Tough spot here. I would take your wife to see an OBGYN... you will get the bill in the mail and you can see how much the charge is. You can then compare that bill to what your previous employer would charge for one month of Cobra. If cobra is less than the bill, you can elect cobra back to May 1st and submit the bill to them. 

I would also let the OBGYN know that your uninsured due to loss of employment and see what the cash price is. 

Either way take care of your wife... the financial/insurance stuff can come later. "
HealthInsurance,"When is the school's effective date for the new plan, 5.1?"
HealthInsurance,"This. The deductible also encourages insureds to be more judicious with their healthcare than they might be otherwise \(perhaps avoiding unnecessary and/or wasteful medical care\) which, in theory, reduces costs overall.  If we also had a system with better price transparency for medical care \(where it was more reasonable to shop around for services\), then it would also function to encourage providers to compete based on price and insureds to shop for providers accordingly."
HealthInsurance,"Sorry for this added stressor on what should be a happy day.

Routine delivery can run $7\-$12k\+ depending on where you are.

Your employer's cavalier response to your inquiry is...weird. You're in for a  tug of war to have coverage reinstated. You'll have to demonstrate you got no notice of any enrollment period or enrollment period deadline, while all your peers apparently did.

You'll want to get a copy of your employer's Summary Plan Description \(SPD \- your HR folk are obliged to provide it on request\), and comb your email for any messages related to your benefits and enrollment processes.

Prepare yourself for a long back &amp; forth with your HR bureaucracy, a skirmish you may want to enlist your state's insurancce regulators, your state elected officials, and/or any union presence in the teaching profession. You'll want allies who'll support your position that the school's sadministrative process is unfair and/or not communicated well. Frankly, you haven't made a convincing case for us, so get facts and practice up....."
HealthInsurance,"I work in the health industry for covered CA. If youre taxes at the end of the year are zero then yes you would be eligible for medical. Free coverage if you want to Continue to be covered for health. If you want to make sure you have a more  comprehensive plan then look at some other alternatives like the new short term medical plans  coming out this june/July or even the medical Sharing plans. All of these options will keep you safe from the mandated penalty you get for not having health insurance. Hope this helps! "
HealthInsurance,\+
HealthInsurance,Currently in a very similar if not the same boat. What state of the union are you in?
HealthInsurance,"That might be your best option. If you’re paying cash it will definitely discounted, and the more you can offer to pay up front, the more likely the are to settle with you. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"&gt;it is common.

Not common \- yet. Increasing numbers of employers are doing something like it \(ex: charging more for keeping spouse as dependent where coverage is available elsewhere\)"
HealthInsurance,My that answers everythujf. Thank you so much!
HealthInsurance,"I'd imagine lots of people not being able to afford insurance if that were the case. Some plans are ridicolous. "
HealthInsurance,"Do you  currently have coverage?

All health coverage is local; your options,  and their costs to you, depend on your ""local"" circumstances \- age, expected income, health status, and location \(city, state \- where you are within CA will change what options you  have\). Responses to what may seem ""personal"" questions are vital to revealing what your real health coverage options are. [Covered California](https://www.coveredca.com) will identify your options with info of the kind mentioned."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"As one cash flow management option, take a look at this [walkthru of a COBRA bridge strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/). It may save you the outlay of some dough while you shop for new coverage and  a new job.

The change in your employment status changes your coverage options, of course, but don't overlook that the change in your income picture may make you eligible for substantial ACA premium credits as well."
HealthInsurance,"seems kind of hard to decide this absent comparison of benefit designs. OP, post de\-identified Summaries of Benefits and Coverage \(SBCs\) for your spouse's &amp; your own coverage.

It's not just what you pay month\-in, month out for coverage; it's also how generous the benefit promises  made  by  the coverage you're considering."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, I'm sure this will probably be how things go unfortunately "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, this is very helpful, a ton of info I didn't know. Thank you."
HealthInsurance,Your starting point is healthcare.gov. Losing coverage from your current employer-provided policy will open up a special enrollment period for you. There is also COBRA.
HealthInsurance,"Ah, gotcha!"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the advice. I’ll double check cobra. Can you really elect even after an unexpected illness occurs?

Also, not sick. Just want to avoid the whole unexpected bus thing and financial ruin."
HealthInsurance,"Very well said.  Completely concur.  "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Is this common, or even legal?

increasingly common, and legal in that an employer is not obliged to offer benefits at all \(an employer COULD decide to incur penalties for not offering ACA coverage; most don't\) and ACA doesn't require that dependent benefits be offered."
HealthInsurance,"your insurer bases its computation of the benefit to be paid on the bills you incur, and pays based on the benefit formula of the plan/policy you're covered by. 

Your care providers  collect, or attempt to collect, their share of *your* share of the covered portion of the bill  directly from you. That share  usually does depend on whether your treatment providers are in or  out of network"
HealthInsurance,"Not sure what you mean by share of your share

if i really owed 4000 i would get a bill from the doc office for 4000 correct my health insurance company doesnt send bills out right?"
HealthInsurance,"Avonex is produced by Biogen.   They gave us a few months for free when we were denied by Medicare and later hooked us up with the grant program that is paying right now.  It dries up in a few months and I'm planning my next steps.  "
HealthInsurance,"No, I just paid the premium lol. I *have* the money in savings, and can earn it month to month with my part time jobs, it’s just that I felt shorted for the month of April so I didn’t want to pay it I could possibly get out of it.

HealthInsurance,"I used to work for Cigna and know this program very well. They will help you and your family navigate the difficult process of claims payments and also help answer questions about your treatment plan when your doctor isn’t available.  I highly recommend this program. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,Waiting on insurance...
HealthInsurance,"Generally specific diagnosis are neither covered or not covered.  It's more about the procedure/treatment being done in combination with the diagnosis.

Something like facial surgery may be considered cosmetic and not covered.  But facial surgery paired with a diagnosis like a cleft lip is likely to be covered.

No one will be able to give you a blanket answer.

Being a minor wouldn't have any affect on coverage unless a procedure or treatment is age specific (like birth control for a 4 yo girl, not going to be covered due to age).  But your age may affect what a doctor would be willing to do or not do without your parent's consent."
HealthInsurance,"My feeling is both previous respondents are correct, meaning that you could obtain an ACA policy AND evaluate upnorth's strategy without expending ""new"" money \- that is you might optimize your current health spending budget by ""leveraging"" your parents ""gift"" of ACA help"
HealthInsurance,"No and No. See other's responses, but it's only going to get worse. "
HealthInsurance,"Forgot about that option, thanks will check it out!"
HealthInsurance,"Once you get that Explanation Of Benefits check for what services were billed. They may have billed for something alongside the office visit. You may be able to talk to the provider even if you disagree. I don’t know how often it works but I’ve heard a lot of people talking it out with the provider. "
HealthInsurance,Thank you yes I just sent him an email to explain my situation
HealthInsurance,Any suggestions? If I switched the companies I am doing contracts for would that count as a job change and make me eligible for special registration or would I need to be non-1099 for  a period before that would kick in.
HealthInsurance,"Employers often add a wrap on HDHPs that apply a copay to maintenance medication rather than the deductible and coinsurance as they would for other benefits or medication. Check the Evidence of Coverage (or whatever your carrier's equivalent document is, COI, etc.)"
HealthInsurance,If the company drops an insurance provider then is there much hope that the new provider will honor the deductible if it has already been paid?  Any rules around them doing that halfway through the calendar year?
HealthInsurance,TYVM for the clarification!
HealthInsurance,"Are you SURE you've correctly evaluated your eligibilty for premium credits? I tried accessing NYStateofHealth this am but it's down, so I don't have a handy way of checking myself"
HealthInsurance,"I'm no doctor, but I work for one. I have never in my career seen a patient get approved for a Brand name drug without trying the generic. Here's a few sneaky tricks though...    

1) have your doctor call in a one week supply of the generic, pick it up (generics are cheap) call the dr and report an ""Itolerable side effect"" (headache, fever, fatigue). Then you've satisfied the plan requirement. The office can resubmit the prior auth saying that you tried it. For this to work you'll need at least a week of brand name pills to tide you over. 

2) some doctors offices lie and say you tried it, but that's between you and them.

3) sign up for the brand company's patient assistance program if you qualify (free meds delivered to drs office for you to pick up). Meeting the qualifications for this is tough, you have to really be struggling financially. 

4) try the generic. Our patients were outraged when insurance companies started mandating generic trials, but now the majority are just fine on their generics. Not a huge difference in the medication. 

Basically the insurance company is saying, ""why should we have to pay more money for your Rx every month when a cheaper one exists? It's a business"
HealthInsurance,Sometime depending on what tier the prescription is in the deductible does not apply.  so some plans you pay on the deductible in the drug is tiered 3-5.  If you have prescription in tiers 1-2 you dont pay on the deductible.
HealthInsurance,"The crazy thing is lots of the plans available to low income individuals who aren't eligible for medicaid don't make sense. I just did a quick estimate calculator on the [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) site. My deductible would be 14k, with $800 a month. That's for me and my spouse. Now consider this, this is with putting in 22k yearly income. It's absolutely absurd. The cost of healthcare in the United States needs to be addressed. It's just that the system is built and is so large, it's hard to even comprehend how you'd go about dismantling it and completely reworking it. 

Healthcare shouldn't be something only the rich can afford. I know people get into arguments about whether it's a ""right"" or not. I don't think that's the right perspective. I think it's just the right thing to do. To make basic needs like food, shelter and healthcare affordable. That should be top priority in a society. Not because it's a right but because it's the right thing to do. Because we're talking about humans. 

I mean seriously...14k deductible when you only make 22k. That was the bottom of the barrel plan too! There were plans that came up that were more than my monthly income. How is that even a suggestion?"
HealthInsurance,If they are healthy have them go with a high deductible plan. Preventative care is covered at 100% due to ACA and they’ll have a cap on deductible and out of pocket which will help in the event that they need to use the insurance. Going without isn’t a good idea.
HealthInsurance,"So, should I apply now? Where do I apply?"
HealthInsurance,"Do you wear glasses or contacts? If you don't, I would skip it. I don't think an eye exam would cost what you're paying in premiums."
HealthInsurance,"No out of network plan benefits. I've considered going elsewhere for psychotherapy but I have a long standing history with this provider so I would prefer to stay with him if at all possible. 
I was more concerned with the fact that the behavioral health individuals were saying that an MD can't bill for psychotherapy, yet the in network psychiatrists I saw billed for psychotherapy and were approved/paid"
HealthInsurance,"Yes, call them and ask them, they have to tell you. The customer service number on your card. "
HealthInsurance,"it looks like it, it's like you feel great for years but then that one time you might need a surgery or ER and you are just done"
HealthInsurance,"Well, elective is going to be the key part. Most plans these days from major insurers at least cover some non-elective plastic surgery or cosmetic-ish procedures so long as there’s a medically necessary reason. Breast reconstruction. Blepharoplasty. Varicose vein ablation. Those can all have medical reasons."
HealthInsurance,"Let me make sure I understand: you want to be on employer B plan as an individual plan for yourself or another private provider, and your children on their own separate employer B plan? If so, no that cannot happen. Employer B only will allow dependents to be insured through the employee. (Which will be true for all employer based health insurance. Other wise they'd have to offer insurance to anyone regardless if they're an employee or Joe from down the street) And they do not have to subsidize the cost of dependents like they do for the employee, as you're seeing. "
HealthInsurance,"Your employer will not provide your children health insurance without you also being on the plan. The children are eligible for insurance *through you* specifically. "
HealthInsurance,"That’s actually not entirely true when a member seeks services at an In Network provider. The provider has previously agreed to what they can charge for each procedure/service on what’s called a fee schedule. These rates are based on a percentage of what Medicare charges. They also sign contracts that says they are not allowed to go after the member for anything above these negotiated fees. When the member goes Out of Network, then they can basically charge what they want because there is no fee schedule or contract in place with the insurance company. "
HealthInsurance,"primary coverage for dependent children is adjudicated using the birthday rule lissa identified, &amp; the applicable elements of the birth date  are month, day, hour \- everything but year. Tl;dr, which parent's plan is primary should not change"
HealthInsurance,"Basically, we currently get health care through my husband’s job.  He is quitting and we are going into business together.  Right now it’s looking like about 13k for the year for getting good health care for the two of us.  "
HealthInsurance,"That's one way to do it. After you submit an application and the Marketplace tells you what advance premium tax credit (APTC) you are being offered, you will have the option to take all, some or none of the tax credit as an advance. Whatever you end up being entitled to at the end of the year will be added to your tax refund or reduce your tax liability. The other side is if you underestimate your modified adjusted gross income then you might owe some or all of your APTC back at the end of the year. Most people take the credit as an advance, but it does come with possibility of owing money back at the end of the year.

You might consider reapplying for medicaid. Usually you can apply as many times as you want. Now that you know what the threshold is, wait until you can show that your recent income is under that threshold and reapply. In the meantime, you can apply for a Marketplace/healthcare.gov plan. Just make sure you cancel your Marketplace plan ASAP after you're approved for medicaid. You can't have both and if you do, you'll owe all of the APTC you received after you were dual covered (after you started Medicaid). Also, if you ever become eligible for health insurance through your job, that will *probably* make you ineligible for the APTC.

oh, if you have a special enrollment period based on your denial from Medicaid during open enrollment or during another special enrollment period, then you only have 60 days to apply for a Marketplace plan after your Medicaid denial. Don't miss the application deadline for the Marketplace or you'll probably be out of luck until 2019 (though you can apply for Medicaid anytime).

EDIT: Don't pay the penalty. For most folks it is cheaper to pay the penalty than pay for health insurance. If your income is around the medicaid eligibility threshold, then you are not one of those folks."
HealthInsurance,"Do you not have COBRA available? Either way, no, you shouldn't have to pay the fine for being without coverage for 2 months. If you do get any marketplace subsidies, I've never heard of them being counted as income."
HealthInsurance,"Did you / will you get a COBRA package from your previous employer? You can elect that retroactively. 

If it's just the one visit though and it ends up being uncomplicated, you might end up with less overall expenses by just seeing a doctor at a local clinic or urgent care. (Since you'll be responsible for 100% of the insurance premium rather than half or less depending on how much your employer covered). "
HealthInsurance,"My dad's yearly income is 43k, so it's just a few thousand above the max. I make 15k, but I don't know if that gets combined with his for the household income, since I'm a minor. He got a letter from the insurance company a couple days ago, saying that he needs to give them a social security number or they'll stop covering us, he doesn't have one, but we still have coverage for another three months."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks!  The actual deal here is that Kaiser will give a credit for a deductible paid to Premera.  Premera, however, won't transfer what we paid to a new Premera plan.  So, we're screwed.  Benefits thinks there's no COBRA option, but if I were being laid-off then it seems I could get Premera through COBRA even-tho they are ending their contract with the company June 1.  "
HealthInsurance,Vet other people's opinions. Find and ask a professional for advice.
HealthInsurance,"Are you sick? Do you absolutely need to go to the doctor within those 30 days? You almost may be better off not insuring ahead of time and taking the risk. There is also the option of not choosing COBRA upfront (you usually have 60 days to elect), and then if you have some terrible healthcare need, you may be able to elect after the fact if it is worth it financially. Does that make sense? Let's say, you get Strep Throat, you are uninsured, you go to Minute Clinic and pay the $100 and that's the end of it. You really don't need the COBRA because it would cost more than that. But, let's say you get hit by a bus (NO ILL INTENT MEANT), you maaaaay want to elect that COBRA after the fact because hospital bills are probably a lot more than the COBRA premium. Check with your current job and have them confirm you can elect within 60 days after leaving the job. Let me know if you have questions. Health insurance is sort of my thing."
HealthInsurance,"Hello, have you tried talking to the health insurance marketplace about the current situation that you guys are in? You might be able to get your brother on an ACA plan. You could possibly get him a child only policy.

HealthInsurance,That’s a solid response.
HealthInsurance,"You get the discount because you have insurance. 

Deductible applies to stuff other than routine care like the above poster says. There may even be zero copay services you have access to. "
HealthInsurance,"I ended up calling Ambetter once I got a voice. I talked to a supervisor to see if they would waive my April premium. She submitted it to billing but no dice. Oh well :(
"
HealthInsurance,"I work in a primary care clinic and this is what I would also suggest. Appointment first, meet the provider, then they know you and that you'll be on their panel. Then tell the insurance. Insurance may just assign a random provider by default and you don't necessarily have to see that person."
HealthInsurance,"insurer doesn't know that OP, for some reason, has paid clinician full price \- and maybe more than the rate on which insurer based its reimbursement? \- for the treatment. 

Frankly, the scenario raises some questions....."
HealthInsurance,"1095 would be reported to the IRS for both entities.

Technically they can know. Whether they enforce is a separate matter. "
HealthInsurance,"Virtually no short term health plans cover pre-existing conditions, nor are they required to by law. You could look into travel insurance which might cover you in case of a hospitalization. You'd have to buy that prior to arriving in the US."

I might be going to the most expensive doctor in the state, but I don't have a freaking clue and neither does their office or the insurance company.  I can't think any other system/service in the world that works that way.  When I can't be an informed buyer allowed to comparison shop, the costs spiral absolutely out of control which is where we find ourselves today.

I'm not talking about emergency situations, but there are plenty of times where scheduled medical services could theoretically be shopped around to find similar quality at a lower price and this would certainly drive down costs.

I get this would be difficult to accomplish, but it has be easier trying to take all the profit out of our private healthcare system to implement than a nation\-wide single payer or same entity one."
HealthInsurance,"Depends on your plan, a lot of BCBS plans do cover out of network providers, but almost always at a higher deductible and lesser percentage rate. If you are able to log into your account on BCBS, you should be able to look up your benefits. If you don't have BCBS yet and are just asking, then it really depends on the policy you go after, so read all the limitations. "
HealthInsurance,"First of all, don't worry. You will be approved. Whether it will cover your current prescription is another question. Make sure to mention the drugs you need coverage for. Because you are permanently and totally disabled \(the only way your mother could claim you at age 27\) you should never go without insurance. Have your mom call the marketplace and they will handle the rest. 

FYI: If your mother is claiming you on her taxes in error, you should absolutely qualify for subsidies and her income is not important. She/you may need to amend past tax forms if she has claimed you in error. This is a big deal to the IRS."
HealthInsurance,"Have any of you guys heard of hiding income? (Not illegally) to make it to where we would qualify "
HealthInsurance," You don't currently have health insurance then? The problem you're facing is that the ACA has safeguards in place to prevent people from buying insurance only when they need $$$ procedures then dropping it as soon as they are better. It requires non interrupted coverage and special enrollments for qualified events.

I know nothing about your marketplace or whats available in your area but for me I get a choice of 2 plans, both on and off the marketplace. There is no longer any company that sells direct to consumer with none of the ACA limitations.

 "
HealthInsurance,"Just curious, who was your source for the child support info?"
HealthInsurance,"Okay, got it.  Thanks for the explanation!"
HealthInsurance,Thanks for this suggestion. I checked this but don't believe she qualifies.
HealthInsurance,"do you know how to contact the judge's office? S/he probably has staff that deal with administration of court orders like yours. Basically you just want to confirm whether there is an administrative fix that gets kids same or better coverage for less economic pain all around. You're not trying to get out of paying for coverage \- you're looking to optimize how $ is spent for their coverage so that you might, y'know, buy them an ice cream cone once in awhile, etc"
HealthInsurance,Non ACA plans can do whatever they please.
HealthInsurance,"Have they looked into deductible HMO plans? "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for your help. I will take your advice and call them instead of doing an appeal. The only thing I'm not sure of is when the end date for the old coverage actually is. If it has been ""retroactively terminated"" as you say, then there is no issue. But my dad didn't call his old company and inform them that they were still paying for us on their group policy until after the doctor visit \(about two weeks after\). So I'm not sure if they ended the coverage after my dad called, or if they ended it retroactively as you suggest."
HealthInsurance,"Yes, but it typically only happens on very large claims. FYI as the subscriber, you can also negotiate with the doctor too. "
HealthInsurance,I also appreciate your tone and helpfulness instead of simply calling me ignorant and saying there is basically nothing. Not exactly what someone with diagnosed depression/anxiety wants to hear for obvious reasons.
HealthInsurance,"yeah, this isn't accurate"
HealthInsurance,"Yes. This is causing a lot of older people to stay in the workforce past where they would normally retire. My mom is 62, and is essentially working for health insurance at this point."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;COBRA isn’t based on your income. It’s 102&amp;#37; of the premium for your previous health plan.

I read that online, which initially turned me off from even considering COBRA. I barely understand what's in the several page packet they physically mailed to me. The only page included with any kind of numbers or information as it pertains to me says I have the following coverage, which is a ""$7150 Medical Plan,"" and a monthly premium for such coverage is as follows at $63.68, which is where I thought maybe it still wouldn't be so bad afterall.

&gt;If you’re healthy and don’t have pre\-existing conditions you could probably get by with just catastrophic insurance.

Is that available in the marketplace or elsewhere? I've actually never heard of it.

Have not enrolled in anything yet, as I wanted to try and figure something out.  I have until mid next month to do so."
HealthInsurance,"Sorry, I’m not sure I understand - what is your reason for appealing? What do you think they did wrong? Do you think they calculated something incorrectly, or they did it correctly but it’s still really expensive for you?"
HealthInsurance,"these days, typically a secondary plan will only pay additional benefits if its benefit formula is the more generous of the two plans \- in which case it might pay the difference of what it would have paid if it were the sole source of coverage and what your primary source of coverage has actually paid.

In other words, you are unlikely to have 100&amp;#37; of your Rx charge covered by the combination of the two plans.

source: I've been in the health benefits business longer than I care to admit"
HealthInsurance,"Most people will not have $7500 in claims for the year, so they don’t have to pay it. In your scenario everyone would pay more in premiums regardless of if they had claims or not. "
HealthInsurance,"you can still buy short term health insurance policies  that resemble the low\-value individual health insurance policies that were ""available"" pre\-ACA. And the standards for acceptable short\-term coverage have been relaxed, to the public's detriment IMO"
HealthInsurance,"You're worried about when you can start a plan. There are a couple different medical sharing companies. Most popular are Christian care ministry and Aliera medical sharing. Both of those typically can get you started for a June 1st effective date at this point. I don't know any retro active plans. Look at those, highly recommend either of those options if you want coverage to start asap without needing a qualifying event. "
HealthInsurance,"I have just reread your comment, and she is in New York. That is phenomenal for you. New York has an expanded version of Medicaid, that is called New York state of health. It offers very generous income limits compared to the rest of the country. And it definitely will cover her health issues."
HealthInsurance,"Hi OP!  I help with Medicaid/Marketplace all the time and am working on getting some information together for you.  However, some of your options are dependent on what state you will be moving to.  If you are comfortable, could you be willing to let me know what state you will be residing in (either here or in a PM?).  If not I can still get some general info together but I can give you more concrete details that way."
HealthInsurance,"I do, and stated multiple times that I don't know if it's true. We only found out yesterday that the cost would be so high, and I plan on asking a professional. But I'm asking on this thread to hopefully get in touch with people who know more than me and can point me in the right direction until I'm able to talk to a professional, because right now I'm starting at exactly zero knowledge on this topic. "
HealthInsurance,Good to know! Thanks for your help
HealthInsurance,"Contact the billing department for the physician group; inform them that you were balance-billed and ask them to apply the contractual adjustment per the remittance advice they received from your insurance company. If they refuse, contact your state’s insurance department to report them. If they are an in-network provider with your insurance, it is illegal to balance bill you and there can be a lot of legal ramifications should they continue to do so. "
HealthInsurance,"Use your company insurance. 

Your employer has no access to your medical records. The only exception is self-insurance.  And with 50 people, they don’t self insure. 

As part of the ACA / Obamacare, the rates are not related to health or usage.  Just Age, zip-code, and smoking.  Nothing else. "
HealthInsurance,I just looked through my decree and no where does it states that health insurance for the kids will only be through a employer it says the obligee which is me will be providing health insurance it doesn't stay where I will get health insurance from this doesn't make any sense I don't see why I should be forced to take out health insurance via the employer rather than privately
HealthInsurance,I do! I'll still call and make sure though. TY!
HealthInsurance,"Good to know. I do have a couple of weeks to decide, so I'll see what happens.

"
HealthInsurance,"Well, they should. They are the only ones that are truly able to tell you that something is covered since they are the ones paying for it."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Is there any hope of directly buying a plan from Premera and having them apply the deductible through December? 

Unlikely. How big is your company? It's kind of strange for a firm of any size to change plans mid\-year AND make no provision at all for people who've spent plenty of dough towards the old plan's deductible. That's just HR/benefits malpractice."
HealthInsurance,"No if you have an infection in your eye and go to an Urgent Care, then it would be processed under medical. Vision insurance is mainly for frames and eye sight exams, not when you have a medical issue with your eyes. "
HealthInsurance,"I know Anthem.com has their application forms on their website under the forms menu drop down. The form gives you a place to put down a special enrollment period assuming you have one.  There may be other companies that have the form for you, but I’m not sure. "
HealthInsurance,"The only way a breast reduction surgery will be covered is if it's medically necessary. Even something like ""they're so large they are damaging my spine""; that probably will be an almighty battle to get covered; and even there, your chances of success will be slim."
HealthInsurance,"Your employer won't know your personal healthcare information. 

As to whether viagra is on your formulary, it might be, and is probably a brand non-preferred medication and subject to quantity per month limits. "
HealthInsurance,"Your employer will not know what you seek treatment for. At most, they’ll know like, 50 people on their plan take viagra (or whatever number it is). 

It is probably covered, but cheapest as the generic, and probably around 8 pills a month. "
HealthInsurance,"Link isnt working 

http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/medicaid/386566-new-hampshire-wins-approval-to-imose-medicaid-work-requirements"
HealthInsurance,"This is most likely impossible unless you were declared his legal guardian.  Siblings aren't health-care eligible dependents.  You could to go through your state's healthcare market and pick up coverage for him that way.  Alternatively, if he is a minor, enrolling him in a state program for children may be possible and probably more cost effective than going through the market."
HealthInsurance,"Okay, normally I'd ask what their gross income was, but I need to know what their net income is, because he is a contractor. So I need you to pull his taxes from last year, and tell me what his income was after he deducted all his work expenses. And please for the love of God tell me that he filed taxes.

From what you have told me, your mother does not fit one of the very few exceptions to get onto Medicare early. Depending on income however, in the state in which you live, she may qualify for Medicaid."
HealthInsurance,"Be persistent and don’t back down. Your leverage is with the hospital as they are the ones that want to get paid. They need to get involved with the insurance company and solve this issue for you. Insurance companies have people that are responsible for the relationship with doctors and hospitals. They are in the Provider Relations department... Tell the hospital that you want that persons contact info or you want a conference call with them. Either way, it’s the hospitals responsibility to make sure that they provide the information to your insurance company that is accurate and truthful, otherwise your insurance company can deny the claim. I assume this hospital was In Network? Cause that would change everything.... "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;What can I do for June?

take a look at this [COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) \- depending on your circumstances, it can enable you to basically have ""free protection"" for your month."
HealthInsurance,"I will, TY!"
HealthInsurance,"thanks -- I did ask them, and figured someone's personal experience would also be helpful to know"
HealthInsurance,"You can keep COBRA for up to 18 months regardless of whether you get a new job with benefits offered. "
HealthInsurance,"All health coverage is local. Your options, and their costs to you, depend a lot on your local circumstances. You've provided ages, and general health status \- but where are you \(city, state\), and how much annual income do you anticipate? "
HealthInsurance,"Do you have your explanation of benefits from the insurance?  Since the doctor is in network the amount you are billed is usually reduced by the negotiated rate of the insurance.

You'll be able to see from your explanation of benefits from your insurance what the doctor billed insurance and then what the final amount you may owe is.  If the insurance statement says you owe less than the bill, it's possible the doctor's office didn't process the insurance properly.

Or, it's totally possible that the doctor billed the insurance some crazy amount and the $361 is just a percentage of that.

But for me, I haven't met my deductible but usually the cost of doctor visits is negotiated down so I only have to pay my co-pay, but the amount the doctor billed the insurance, before adjustments, was in the $300 - $400 range."
HealthInsurance,"Sometimes the cash discount is super discounted like 75 % and if you cry poor, they even write it off if you say I can pay you Xyz now."
HealthInsurance,"And THIS is exactly the reason why I started a patient advocacy business years ago. 

I've been in the medical billing field for over 20 years and I have had SOOO many patients come to me to ask me to help them with other provider's bills because they just can't understand it, or they don't have the time, or they don't want to put in the effort, etc. 

I know you're ranting and I feel for you, I really do. Unfortunately, this is how the cookie crumbles in the medical insurance industry. I take smoke breaks when I get to desk-flipping mode. 

Better luck to you, seriously!!!"
HealthInsurance,"No, you didn't mess up, doesn't matter unless it was used for nefarious/illegal acts, which it wasn't. "
HealthInsurance,"Can't you get cobra retroactively?  I got this advice but that was a couple of years ago and I'm not sure it's specific to my state.

Best of luck.  Just try to focus on mom and baby.  You've done what you can."
HealthInsurance,"Isn’t Ambetter a plan where you have to see a participating provider? At least that is how it works in the states I’m familiar with... If that’s the case, than why would you want to keep it when you’ve moved out of the country? It’s not like you could use it... "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"drop it. Vision coverage may NOT be better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, for anyone who has no dependents anyway"
HealthInsurance,"Did you get this sorted out? If not, consider reaching out to the Marketplace for help or the Department of Insurance! "
HealthInsurance,You qualify for a plan under the ACAA because you are losing your current plan. Maybe you should try a high deductible plan with an HSA.
HealthInsurance,"I hate to say it but vision coverage isn't typically beneficial. I wear contacts and glasses &amp; I dropped the option years ago after crunching the numbers. I review the option every year during my open enrollment, comparing what I paid out of pocket without the coverage to the amount I would have paid in premiums. I still haven't elected vision since I dropped it. It seems like a deal given the low premium amount but think about what you can receive in vision services for the $153.40 you pay in premiums for the year. That is honestly what you should consider. I realize that costs vary across the country so you may or may not get a lot for that. 

Also, you don't have to worry about not having vision coverage in the event of an accident/injury. That should fall under your medical plan. You can also verify with your medical coverage if you have the 1x/year vision screening. That would probably be a standard vision screening at your physician's office, possibly during an annual physical, but at least any possible issues would be detected.  "
HealthInsurance,Typically they would end it when he was no longer eligible for coverage. Usually works out to either his last day of work or to the last day of the _month_ in which he left work
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  So what the heck is one to do?

where are mom &amp; dad? the prices you've cited sound plausible, but let's go the old 2nd opinion route....."
HealthInsurance,"This doesn’t make complete sense to me. I think he should talk to his HR or union rep.  "
HealthInsurance,"Are they out of network, or do they accept your insurance? If they are “OON” they can balance bill the remaining charges so you pay the amount that was “discounted” by having an insurance company. If this was a true emergency you should have somewhere in your benefit document stating that “providers cannot balance bill for emergency services”. Heck the  code on your explanation of Benefits for the claim may even say. “This amount exceeds the Customary and Reasonable. If these services were done in a non-emergency setting you may be billed for these” or something similar. You can talk directly to the provider or you can call your ins company again to see what can be done on their side. "
HealthInsurance,"well, not whatever, but they 

1\) can, and of course do, run applicants through an underwriting/approval process, and can reject applicants based on responses and 

2\) can decide to cover someone but exclude coverage for health conditions that applicants were dealing with before they applied for coverage."
HealthInsurance,"Lower premiums to encourage healthy behaviors, in the same vein that smokers pay higher premiums. If you have lower cholesterol, are not obese, you get rewarded for these good behaviors by paying less.

For physicians, there are quality metrics - the more they encourage their patients to lead a healthy lifestyle and encourage them to quit unhealthy behaviors the more bonuses they receive. 

We really need to have patients take a more active role in managing their own health. A lot of this would be through preventative measures. Too many people are passive and are not participating in taking care of themselves."
HealthInsurance,This is kind of what I was looking into.  High deductible or catastrophic.  I've only done some research online but the plans still seemed much more expensive than I thought (over a grand).  It might be best if I actually call the insurance company and see what they offer.  Thanks for the advice!
HealthInsurance,I think you need a quick trip to Canada or just fill your prescription at a Canadian pharmacy online. Check to make sure it is verified with CIPArx.
HealthInsurance,"Typically it'll cover a basic eye exam but not lenses.  Vision insurance is a separate entity from medical for adults (it can be included for children).  The type of eye exam you'll need for a contact lense fitting is different than a ""basic eye exam.""  "
HealthInsurance,"Take the HSA and put the difference in cost into the HSA account. Until you have enough in there to cover the cost of deductible. And even then keep putting money in there. "
HealthInsurance,"Trump did, but that won't go into effect until 2018 or more likely 2019 tax year. 

"
HealthInsurance,"OP, do what LSD's outlined"
HealthInsurance,"The copay program didn't change, the terms of your insurance plan likely did. Generally they'd alert you by mail. It is within the rights of the insurance to not count payments made by third party manufacturers to your deductible and out of pocket. So yeah, they'll only count whatever you personally pay for it. Sucks, definitely. I saw a lot of plans change to include that verbiage this year. Take it up with your employer. Humira? "
HealthInsurance,"You wouldn't qualify for a tax credit from the government but you'd still be able to get insurance. Since those companies follow ACA regulations they cannot deny you for pre existing conditions. 

"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Even if you did wait until open enrollment, you won't qualify for subsidies/cost-sharing so you're looking at premiums of $250-$500+ per month, not including a few thousand dollars of a deductible.

I wasn't aware of that. Because I'm eligible for Medicaid? In that case, I guess it might not be worth switching at all.

It is a managed care plan. And I tried the services at my school a while ago, but apparently they only take people on a temporary or short-term basis, so they referred me elsewhere."
HealthInsurance,You must be American! Isn’t it great?!!
HealthInsurance,"Sixty days is a pretty generous window, but I guess that's besides the point now.  For the Humira you can apply for the Patient Assistance Program through the Abbvie Foundation here: [http://www.abbviepaf.org/index.cfm](http://www.abbviepaf.org/index.cfm)

I would look into local community health centers that have sliding scale fees as well."
HealthInsurance,"If it was me I'd sign up and have the double coverage until dropped, then she doesnt need to worry about signing up when dropped from yours and she'll be on a continuing policy. 


When I got my first office job that's basically what I did and had no issues being on my dad's policy and my own. I got off his before 26, because I work in a clinic now and my coverage is way better than his, but I never had any issues with coverage for the couple of things I saw a doctor for during any of this time."
HealthInsurance,"Just make sure you get your medical records from the doctor you're switching from to the one you're switching to, that way the new doctor is in the loop. "
HealthInsurance,"You'd qualify for a special enrollment period through the marketplace because you are losing your insurance. Your cost will depend on the income and dependents on your mom's tax return. I'd call the marketplace or go to healthcare.gov (if federal marketplace) with your mom and fill out an application. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, I'll pass this along to both insurance groups and hopefully they can sort it out.  "
HealthInsurance,"If you don't feel comfortable enough in telling the manager WHY, then is there any way you can clock out without them knowing? How do you turn in your hours? It's got to be a time clock or a sheet you fill out on your own? Since you know the ""sweet"" spot, you have to stay in that range, it's really the best option. Until you get back on the insurance, I mean, how often does she collect your paycheck stubs?
"
HealthInsurance,"It's not really a lesser insurance, per say, it's another government program applied on top of another government program that should still cover her costs 100%. Medicaid will pay what Medicare doesn't. The important thing is to get her on a Plan D that covers the medications she's currently on, or one that covers medications her doctor can change her too instead of what she's on....most medications have competitive drugs that can treat the same problem, and would be covered. "
HealthInsurance,"Regardless, better to pay a couple hundred now and nip this in the bud than wait for complications to occur which could end up costing thousands."
HealthInsurance,"Yes. It is pending. They did not agree to expedite it, so we have to wait two weeks to even find out if they will deny it. All information that we have so far makes our chances look pretty bad."
HealthInsurance,"With medicare you need to get a ""Part D"" drug plan (or else a Medicare Advantage plan that includes drug coverage).

EDIT: More information: https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/get-drug-coverage/get-drug-coverage.html

Also, when choosing a plan, make sure to review their ""formulary"" which is the list of drugs they will pay for and make sure the drugs she needs are on the list or talk with her doctor about equivalent drugs that are."
HealthInsurance," I don't know what other posters are talking about with an ""implosion"" \- I'm in the industry and it's been becoming more and more affordable/available. If anything with all the changes &amp; talk about repeal and replace, private health insurance marketplaces have been doubling down on the individual &amp; small business side of things since the ACA has become kinda ridiculous in pricing. If you're looking for a plan for now until open enrollment, I'd look at a short term health insurance plan. "
HealthInsurance,"That’s exactly what I thought, one last question tho. What if I don’t qualify for market place due to circumstances I don’t feel comfortable disclosing here?"
HealthInsurance,"Is this UHC or UHC River Valley?

I'm wondering if maybe copays don't count towards the deductible here?"
HealthInsurance,"Have you been prescribed it before? Zofran for instance has a quantity / month limit usually. You can always fill it without your insurance. "
HealthInsurance,"Can you document back issues due to the ""condition""? Sometimes that's a way around it but you need to have a doc who knows how to jump through the hoops.  I've heard of people who have had gastric bypass get a full body lift covered because the extra skin affected their health (rashes, etc). It's one way to work the system."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks. I can apply for ACA coverage even though COBRA was offered to me? I was under the impression that I couldn't, but it would be great if I could because I just need short term coverage until I find another job"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Also, due to offering a ""cafeteria plan,"" if one does not accept insurance EVERY YEAR, then they don't get it.

How do you know this if you didn't get any notifications about the enrollment process?"
HealthInsurance,I’m confused. Why is he postponing his surgery? Also doesn’t the union offer retiree benefits?
HealthInsurance,Contact your health insurance company and ask them.
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, look very carefully, then look again. You don't need coverage for stuff you can pay out of pocket. Sharing ""plans"" are not insurance. They will not protect you from the cost of the most expensive rescue care that ""real"" insurance is obliged to."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"1. Right
2. Yes. Her employer plan will be primary
3. Can't say from what you've provided. Depends on what if anything, she's charged for her employer's coverage, how that new coverage covers treatments/medications she needs, and the relative generosity of each plan's benefits"
HealthInsurance,"Have you thought of getting a different job? Or has your husband? Or supplementing your income with a PT job?

The company where I used to work was bought out. New owners wouldn’t cover spouses if said spouse’s work offered insurance. One guy had to quit and find another job because his wife had a lot of medical issues and her work’s insurance was awful. 

There are things to try before you do something as drastic as leaving the country. That’s not easy either, and in countries with nationalized health care you give up a lot of your paycheck to taxes so you might not be any better off. 

I think you should both look for better paying jobs and see what happens. "
HealthInsurance,"You may want to consider an individual insurance agent.  Good luck! "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the detailed reply Real. Do not currently have health coverage. Curious how this site differs from the others I’ve seen. Is it the normal process to need to apply through an application? Near chino CA currently, but might move to lake forest in next few months. "
HealthInsurance,"1. nope \- 100&amp;#37; absolutely not
2. It won't affect the rate if they are on an ACA plan.  If they are level self\-funded \(which some under 50 employers are\) it could, but no more than any other illness such as diabetes, cancer, etc. \(which I'm SURE other employees have\). Worse case scenario and your employer IS partially self\-funded, they won't see who, they'll just see that someone in the group is seeking treatment \- could be a dependent.  I'm not even sure it would register as anything other than outpatient behavioral health \- which could be ANYthing.
3. Insurance company will have record of it.  Why are you concerned?  Do you have a security clearance or intend to get one? If you do, you need to disclose this anyway  \- so keeping it off record isn't really helping you. What WILL help you is getting treatment."
HealthInsurance,"""My insurance is using a different code/reason for the doctor visits than the hospital is using, which conveniently (for them) is one of the few things not covered at all by my plan.""

Insurance companies just can't, nor do they, change codes from what is being billed to them. Fight this and get a 3 way conference call between the hospital, yourself and your insurance company. "
HealthInsurance,"First off, find out if the United Health Student Insurance is an ACA approved plan. If it is, then come back to us. 

If it's not, you're out of luck, it's an exclusion of the policy. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you so much for the detailed answer,  I really appreciate it! "
HealthInsurance,"Is there a specific reason they transferred him to a hospital that is out of network? I'd call the insurance company, ask to speak to a case manager (assuming this is a major illness) and ask hospital #2 if you can speak to a case manager there as well. If the hospital is out of network they can expect a big bill (even with out of network benefits). I'd get my ducks in a row ASAP.  Depending on the state there may be programs to help them since he's under age."
HealthInsurance,"There are six rules for primacy. The first is employee vs dependent, so the plan covering the person as an employee will be prime. Earliest effective date is rule 5 and won’t apply in this case. "
HealthInsurance,"Yup. And I have for more than 5 years. "
HealthInsurance,"Consider short term medical for the month. "
HealthInsurance,"Gonna assume 

a) you've contacted interest groups that focus on your son's condition, via Patients Like Me or other, single-issue organizations.

b) You've scoured your plan's documents -- your Summary of Benefits and Coverage [(it looks like this)](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf), and/or your Summary Plan Description (a more detailed coverage document) to confirm that copays are NOT counted toward your maximum annual out-of-pocket cap.

Generally ""true"" secondary coverage has little value any more; most employers have shifted to ""non-duplication"" coordination of benefits, which (oversimplifying) limits total benefit payouts to what would be paid from the more generous of 2 sources of coverage. Single issue coverage add-ons, like critical illness insurance, seldom if ever address chronic illnesses or behavioral care."
HealthInsurance,"It depends on what you make, but you might be eligible for subsidies on Covered California. If you are making less than $67,000 a year, you should be eligible to go through the exchange. $250 a paycheck is pretty excessive."
HealthInsurance,"Congrats on the job offer! Since you just turned 26, you are eligible for a special enrollment period and can enroll in a Marketplace/Affordable Care Act plan. Just do it within 60 days of your birthday. You can keep that until you're eligible for your new employer's plan in Sept. 
As far as low cost coverage, here's a breakdown of the different tiers of plans: https://www.healthsherpa.com/blog/why-do-metal-levels-matter-when-shopping-for-a-marketplace-plan/ 
The lowest tiers will obviously be the cheapest, but they also cover the least. Do you need any regular medical care? Or do you just want coverage in case of emergencies and for basic things like your annual physical? If the latter, get a catastrophic plan. It's for those under 30 and is the cheapest. It's what I have as well until I get a job with benefits. "
HealthInsurance,"Yup.  Sounds about right.  The cost will vary depending on what provider you choose  but you can pretty much assume it'll be around that amount.  You may get a bit of sticker shock for your prescription as well.  I'd check the presceiption language in the summary of benefits for your plan because  you may be responsible for the full retail price of the prescription.  If it turns out that way and if it's not a generic drug, I'd hop on over to the retailers website for any potential discounts or coupons."
HealthInsurance,It seems odd to me that they’d not want to correct the codes and receive reimbursement. That would be a no brainer for most offices. So I’m assuming they’re sticking with the play therapy code and misled you into believing they were doing something else?
HealthInsurance,"I would give you reddit gold, but I'm a greedy capitalist. So have some reddit silver.

I know about the plans. I did the search and tried to get some quotes from insurance companies. I just don't have much practical experience with receiving health care and dealing with insurance companies. So I was asking more along the practical side of things. If generally $1500/mo is enough to fully insure family of three without any gotchas or pitfalls."
HealthInsurance,"You may want to confirm the facility is In-Network with your plan. The reason I am saying this is the discount is $0. "
HealthInsurance,"That's what we do at our clinic. It's not about overcharging, it's about collecting the patient responsibility after insurance processes the claim. 

Say we bill insurance $150 for your visit, we submit a claim for that amount to your insurance, they tell us our contract with them says they'll pay $93, so we write off the $57. If you still owe toward your deductible, we charge the $93 to your card. Otherwise it's too easy for you to never pay us even though that's what you agreed to when you came to see us/used your insurance."
HealthInsurance,"Hi! So a few things, this is my opinion:

1. You can hop on and off plans each year during Open Enrollment.  No need to make a retirement decision now. :)
2. I think your plan is a good deal for a family - assuming that $3,000 is the family deductible?
3. If the $1,700 is the family deductible for her plan that is very low - but you are paying $5,892 a year for it versus your plan which is $1,404 (minus the 1k your company contributes = $404 per year).
4. The annual deductible difference between plans is $1,300 but you are spending $5,488 more to be on her plan ($5,892 - $404)
5. Keep in mind that plan with the public school system is subject to change over the years - just like any company's plan. 51 is a LONG way off.

If the family deductible is $6,000 on your plan and $3,400 on hers you'll need to re-evaluate based on knowing you'll hit it because of the pregnancy."
HealthInsurance,"Each plan has its own pros and cons. Gateway requires you to have referrals issued from your pcp every time you see a specialist, United Healthcare will allow you to see anyone without a referral if your pcp is one of their gold star providers (if the pcp isn’t gold star, referrals are required for specialist visits). With UPMC you have access to most providers and facilities except for Allegheny Health Network. Aside from emergency services, it’s out of network for UPMC medicaid. Aetna Better Health &amp; Amerihealth are actually pretty flexible, you just have to coordinate most of your care through the pcp. If the insurance web site states they’re accepting new patients but reception says otherwise, they may have closed their panel and not updated the insurance web site. "
HealthInsurance,"They have 24 months until they're eligible for Medicare. Depending on where they are, shopping hard for the leanest possible coverage may save them several hundred a month. Are you sure they've accurately calculated their eligibility for premium credits?"
HealthInsurance,"also, why come back 5 days later and give me that advice?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;You should watch the latest John Oliver episode about rehabs and the racket they are—-most states require zero oversight of them and many states let literally anyone open them.

While it's true that anyone can open a ""rehab,"" in order for a rehab to be covered under your insurance it will be medically directed (meaning actual MD doctors and psychiatrists oversee and manage treatment) and a licensed residential medical facility.  There is a big difference between the two.

Your questions have already been answered correctly.  Make sure to contact your insurance company before scheduling admission to confirm you're using an in-network facility and that the facility will take care of all pre-authorizations/certifications for you.

Don't let anyone dissuade you from seeking treatment. "
HealthInsurance,"I googled Virginia Marketplace Navigator and couldn't find anything other than people who can help enroll you in healthcare, if your offer to help with the hunting is still up I'd be eternally grateful for some assistance. "
HealthInsurance,"Okay that makes much more sense than what I initially thought. I’ll look into the Medicare Part D and have her get set up with this come Monday. We knew something was weird because she was suddenly being charged small fees for drugs that were once entirely free. But then the spiriva thing happened which she had been getting for free for five years only to be denied at the pharmacist this time.  
  
Yeah she got switched to a lot of the generic forms of her main drugs awhile back which was totally fine. I don’t think Spiriva has a generic unfortunately so perhaps when she’s fixed up on the Part D plan she will get it again  
  
Thank you so much seriously. You’ve been a big help. "
HealthInsurance,thank you!
HealthInsurance,"Medicaid will be an option, unless she filed for unemployment AND her unemployment comes to more than $1397 a month. If it’s under that amount then Medicaid will actually more or less be her only option unless you are willing to pay full price for a Marketplace plan (if you’re Medicaid eligible then you aren’t edible for Marketplace subsidies).  There’s no enrollment period so she can apply as soon as you can prove Pennsylvania residency.  "
HealthInsurance,"You have to wait to apply, open enrollment is only from Nov-Dec. You would go through www.healthcare.gov or you can also find an insurance broker in your local area, but I advise the website, personally. "
HealthInsurance,No you will not be. You have a grace period that protects you when you are switching plans.
HealthInsurance,"Wow, that nearly makes any plan a zero-deductible plan!"
HealthInsurance,this didn’t end up being it but it’s super good to know so thank you! (posted the results of the phone call in another comment if curious)
HealthInsurance,"Your last sentence doesn't make sense, I think you meant to say ""UHC PPO as secondary"" not ""HMO PPO"". 

If you're family is covered under your primary HMO with your current employer and your new employer is going to offer a HMO for your primary, then I see NO reason why you wouldn't/couldn't continue using YOUR insurance (through work) as the primary for the family and your husband's insurance as a secondary for the family. 

The only one that might be affected is your husband, his work insurance should be his primary. "
HealthInsurance,"There's a fairly broad variation in sharing ministry plan designs. Their chief value may be in sparing you from ACA penalities for not having ""real"" insurance. Ministry plans are NOT insurance; they have internal waiting periods for eligilibility for benefits for serious health conditions; and they are not so great on benefits for the rare/serious/costly treatment health insurance is most important for."
HealthInsurance,"yeah, you're hosed. Or rather, you've hosed yourself.

There's no such thing as you've apparently imagined existed.

But you should double\-check the gap period calculation for your situation. If your ""almost 3 months"" is still less than 3 months on June 1, having ACA coverage that takes effect then should work fine, no?"
HealthInsurance,"Your deductible allows you to self insure for that amount. As others have said, you may not have to actually pay that amount but if you have an HSA with your high deductible plan you try to build it up to cover your deductible. That money will roll over into the next year as well if not used. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. I did see in this rejection of my appeal that I can 'request any additional information related to the appeal' so I'm going to request the recordings they ""reviewed"" before I make my next appeal. I also see that it says ""This Benefit Plan is not subject to state insurance law"" so I'm not sure that the state insurance commissioner could help? Either way, if it comes to that, I will ask to be sure."
HealthInsurance,"He was saying if you can afford to wait (as indicated in your post) then you should sign up during open enrollment in November-December, and your coverage will begin January 1."
HealthInsurance,"Marketplace since she’ll be unemployed and has a qualifying life event (age out) in the last 60 days. 

If she’s healthy and doesn’t need specialists or anything, just get the cheapest plan you can. Or, if she is going to get a job within a couple months, she doesn’t need to be insured in the interim. "
HealthInsurance,"As I said above, you just invented Kaiser Permanente, Henry Ford, Geisinger Health Plan, and a lot of others. The closed model has been around for quite a while."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for this, I was able to speak with my benefits office today and they essentially said the same thing.   However, both insurance groups are self funded.   The rep I spoke to wasnt sure if this complicates things (in terms of the ""oldest policy rule"" and whether they have to legally follow it).  She was going to look into it and call me back.    "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Your best bet is to call the doctors office directly and ask if they accept your plan and new patients. Unfortunately, for insurance companies and hospitals, physician directories and their insurance coverage are often outdated information or flat out mistaken."
HealthInsurance,"I'm not sure how to do that though. When I talked to the [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) people, they said all I needed to do was update my address through them. But after I updated my application, it's still showing my Anthem plan as active.

I'm not even sure you do lose your ability to keep your old plan once you move into a new county that doesn't offer that plan. Like I know I can't sign up for it for next year, but does it really mean I have to get a new plan and can't keep the old one?

Sorry if I seem dumb on all this \&gt;\_\&gt;"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for offering to help!

While the denied claims say that the patient responsibility = $0 due to no medical necessity, the forms I signed at the physical therapist’s office before treatment began holds me responsible for the bills if my insurance doesn’t pay. They wouldn’t allow me to become a patient unless all the forms were signed.

Any other approaches you would recommend to handle this?"
HealthInsurance,"u/mexicanYe The insurance reps don't know because they need a procedure to check, not a diagnosis. You need to have a consult with a Dr, find out how they want to treat this, get the procedure and diagnosis codes, then call the insurance back."
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"I will look to see if she is eligible for COBRA and request their coverage termination practice in writing. I think you have given us a good start in figuring this all out.
Thank you for the information."
HealthInsurance,"I doubt you'll find what you're looking for.

Are you going to actually move to a new home or apartment in the other state and truly become a resident or where you contemplating fraud in order to get insurance in the other state?

If you're doing this just for your therapist fees then unless you therapist is super expensive I seriously doubt you're going to find a policy where the premiums, plus out of network deductible, plus co-pay on out of network benefits will provide any savings vs. just self paying for the therapist.   Out of network generally has a seperate, often  higher, deductible along with a higher co-pay requirement.

You'll have better luck just finding another job, even if it doesn't pay well."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the response that information is really helpful. Since the time has passed, on my ""Application Details"" there is no area to upload documents, should I call them and explain this and figure out what to do?"
HealthInsurance,"Call them. Escalate to higher ups.  You should have received some sort of notification within 30 days. Most states are super slow to respond or reply.


Basically they will say call marketplace, you call them and they will say call your state Medicaid.  Nothing really gets done.


Call your state Medicaid and escalate. There is a case in there if they can find it, they can tell you the status.  If they can’t and stick to “ call healthcare.gov”  call marketplace.

Ask them to look at at your application and then if they say calll Medicaid in your state, ask to speak to a supervisor.  


Remain calm and polite during all this. It will help you immensely.  (It’s going to be super frustrating and upsetting but it’s a hoop to jump thro)

Explain that your without coverage and haven’t heard anything and need coverage . 

If your lucky, they may let you enroll in marketplace coverage pending hearing back from your state Medicaid.

Bear in mind, if you enroll in marketplace coverage and you get approved for Medicaid, cancel your marketplace coverage as soon as you find out your covered.

It will bite you in the rear if you don’t at tax time.

Sometime the application in healthcare.gov doesn’t send anything or it goes into a void and state never gets it.   
The knee jerk reaction is to tel you to call elsewhere and wait. 

Asking your state based Medicaid if they even have a case or an application is a great starting point.


Hope this helps some."
HealthInsurance,We had to change our business structure to get better insurance.  We were originally a sole proprietorship but had to change to an S Corp to be eligible for the better group health insurance policies.  Health insurance will break the bank regardless until Congress steps in a fixes it
HealthInsurance,"K that makes sense so finally an answer. Yeah I’ve never had coverage. So in essence I’m screwed. All current plans are temporary lasting only 90 days and don’t cover pre existing conditions. In addition they are all HMO plans.
So my only choice is to wait for November  when enrollment comes around ? "
HealthInsurance,"Yes, they would pick them up as there is no such thing as pre-existing items being denied thanks to the ACA.

This is probably a good thing, but it will also depend on the deductible with the new insurance plan. As you stated, the therapy IS actually being ""paid"" for, but in terms of your deductible, so it's not like they're denying the claims, you simply have a high deductible (or so it seems). In either case, care can be billed to the new insurance company, just make sure the physical therapist is in your new insurance network or you'll be in another world of hurt with higher deductible or even no out of network coverage. 

The helmet, however, was already received, so that could not be billed to the new insurance, but if and when your son needs a new helmet, then it would be covered under the new insurance IF they cover that piece of DME. "
HealthInsurance,"31 days in May. I would apply for a Marketplace plan if you don't have something else set up by June 18th. If you end up going that route, you'll need to submit documentation that you were denied medicaid on April 21st, so hold on to (or get a new copy of). any letters you received to that affect."
HealthInsurance,"I agree with your reasoning, I'm just confused where you got the $4800 number from."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"It would benefit the sick person, but not the Insurance Agency. People only look for insurance if they need it. If someone went to go look for insurance because they wanted to get a surgery that they really need done, and they get insurance for a month or so, they'd pay their premium of lets say 500 dollars a month, plus the deductible of lets say 4000 dollars, but their hospital bill ended up being something like 8000 dollars, and they cancelled the plan a month into when they got it. Then the insurance company loses money. Now, lets say a lot of people did the same thing, because it's most likely what would happen. The insurance company wouldn't be able to afford to insure people. 

I talk to people about dental insurance every day, they get upset because they need a major service done, but they don't want to wait a 12 month waiting period to get such service. Insurance is for when the unexpected happens. :)"
HealthInsurance,"This. My guess is that when they talk about Rising Insurance costs, they're talking about malpractice insurance. Regrettably, there has been an increase in fraudulent claims against doctors, in deprived areas, and specifically in rural to private areas. This is probably what they're talking about. Despite this, a well-managed practice should be able to survive in that kind of environment."
HealthInsurance,"I have a high deductible plan, usually use GoodRX to get discounts because it doesn't cover my medications until the deductible has been met. "
HealthInsurance,"The penalty is EITHER $347.50/child OR 2.5% of your yearly household income.  You'll pay whichever one is higher.  The IRS has a tool that allows you to estimate your penalty amount here: https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/estimator/isrp/ "
HealthInsurance,"Maximum allowance is what they allow per code that is billed by the physican's office. So, let's say you have a doctor's visit and they bill $200, but BCBS's maximum allowance is $100. They would then pay 50% of that ($50.00) and you would have to pay the remaining $50. This is compared to the in-network rate that they would cover, which could be anywhere from 70-90% based on your policy. 

Keep in mind, that out of network providers are NOT required to ""accept"" BCBS's maximum allowance and that they may actually bill you for whatever is left over after BCBS payment. So, in the example above, they can actually bill you for $150. It depends on the provider's office and their policy. My clients are actually out of network, but we will accept the maximum allowance. So, some do and some don't, you'll want to see who does. 

Another point, this 50% is only paid AFTER your out of network deductible has been met. Until then, you are responsible for the maximum allowance of the code billed (if your provider will accept that) or 100% of the billed amount (if your provider doesn't accept the maximum allowance) but that money paid will be applied to your out of network deductible. 

Any other questions, let me know!"
HealthInsurance,"Yes, it's a smaller copay, but we were checked in officially, and had to be checked out, was about an hour and a half, mostly just waiting on nurses and doctors to come in. "
HealthInsurance,"I am a hospital billing specialist and I would love to help, if possible! Are you positive that your insurance says YOU are responsible?  Every medical necessity denial I've seen is not patient responsibility because the doctor should not provide treatments that are not considered medically necessary. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;a plan for that low wouldn't cover dental care.

dental insurance is generally not a good use of your resources, whether your own or your business's.

&gt;I'm guessing because we have no employees, we can't get business coverage?

yeah.

do you/could you belong to a professional association of any kind? that can be a ""group\-like"" option for health coverage. Without looking, my guess is whatever options are available to you via ACA will be the best value for your money."
HealthInsurance,"I have checked into it, and there are some programs, but it really seems like a toss-up as to whether you get ""approved"" and there's no telling how long it takes to get the drug even if you are. And it's not a reimbursement program, you'd have to literally hope to get the drug from the mfgr."
HealthInsurance,"ignorance about the rules is not a valid argument.

it's a valid argument \- there are likely more than a few ""rules"" about health coverage even you &amp; I are ignorant of \- but it's not an argument that will gain OP coverage

I would advise you to pay cash for your Humira

Humira goes for $5,500 \- $6,500 for two pens. Probably not an option for OP. Even with patient assistance the stuff is a significant budget item.

OP, take a cue from  Annamolly &amp; check with local community health centers. [Use this  locator to find one \- or more \- near you](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/)."
HealthInsurance,"I'd have to look into some of the specifics during our open enrollment period (which at this point isn't until September or October anyway). There ought to be some cheaper plans that they offer, but I seem to remember that mine was one of the cheaper options when I signed on for it four years ago. I do know that they offer the same flat employer contribution ($250) to whatever plan I choose, regardless of what the plan is. 

My HMO isn't through Kaiser. "
HealthInsurance,Also you don't want to lie on your taxes.  If they audit you and catch you it's tax fraud.

HealthInsurance,"That's what I thought, you have cause for filing a complaint with your insurance commisioner. Read this link very carefully, pay attention to pages 27-29 and 33. They have 30 days to pay or deny a claim, they have 60 days to respond to appeals. This 15 months remark is pure bullshit. Let me know if you need further help understanding this after reading this: https://www.michigan.gov/documents/lara/MI_Consumer_Guide_to_Health_Insurance_401745_7.pdf"
HealthInsurance,"Yea once you have enough in the HSA you can lower how much you deposit.  I would recommend still add some. Some HSA accounts will start investing your money once you hit a certain amount. Also you can use HSA for glasses and other medical expenses. "
HealthInsurance,"Even if you did wait until open enrollment, you won't qualify for subsidies/cost-sharing so you're looking at premiums of $250-$500+ per month, not including a few thousand dollars of a deductible.  

Seeing as that you're in Illinois, did you get enrolled into a managed care plan?  Most people did, and depending on your enrollment date you might be able to switch.  You can also call your plan and request to speak to a case worker.  They can help you find a provider and coordinate services.  

Also, most colleges have behavioral health services on campus.  So if you haven't yet, I would look into that as well."
HealthInsurance,Are you on an HMO?
HealthInsurance,"I’m not gonna lie. That sleep disorders as a whole aren’t covered strikes me as pretty f-in weird. Do you have your insurance through your job? If so, they have a lot of control over the plans they offer so it would be worth reaching out to them about this."
HealthInsurance,"You can put your address down on the billing forms for when you see the doctor. That said, the primary insured can review all EOB's on the plan, but that will only state the physician name and something generic like ""physician"" or ""lab"" or ""surgery"""
HealthInsurance,"So if the ACA plan provider didn't approve (or perhaps didn't approve *yet*) the medication, does the money I pay definitely count towards out-of-pocket limits?"
HealthInsurance,"I dug a bit deeper.  She was enrolled in Medicare without me knowing from Social Security.  She is now on a medicare advantage plan. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I'm in my 50's and the cheapest I can get is $1700/mo.

Where do  you live? \(City, state\) Individual health coverage for anyone 50ish or older is severely expensive but that's really high if your coverage is for yourself alone."
HealthInsurance,"You have to figure out which one of your insurance is primary and which one is secondary first. Call both plans up to tell them you have 2 insurances and let them hash out which one is gonna take which role. And then receive the information from the pharmacy and submit the claim yourself if the pharmacy is unable to but typically the pharmacy has the ability to submit a primary and secondary claim to the insurance, they just need to know which is which. 

Two scenarios. 1 is your primary is the $10 copay, when it is submitted to the secondary it will say primary paid x dollars and copay amount is $10. And that $10 will be $0 insurance paid and $10 deductible responsibility. In this case you will be paying the copay and lowering deductible $10 on secondary. 

Scenario 2, your primary is $27 deductible. When submitting to secondary, it says you have $27 deductible to pay. The secondary will not pay anything because it is a deductible cost and not a copay cost. Now you pay $27. Secondary plans typically will cover the patient total cost minus deductible cost. Depends on what the policy of the secondary plan is but typically they don't pay deductibles.

Scenario 3. Say this is a brand name drug. Because you have private insurance you can use a coupon assistance or copay card in addition to your insurances. They will lower the cost of copay or make it no copay. Or they will pay the deductible for you but it doesn't lower your deductible or out of pocket for you because you weren't the one that paid.

Disclaimer: I am a random person on the internet. My information may be wrong. Please take with caution."
HealthInsurance,"Confirmed as you describe. Up to the employer and they set their own requirements. Inquire with them. "
HealthInsurance,"Is your plan HSA-compatible? If so, can you make contributions via payroll deductions? There are many tax benefits and those dollars will earn interest and can be used for healthcare services. Yes (in 99% of cases) your fiancé and stepson can be on your plan. Depending on your plan and state, you may need to register your fiancé as a Domestic Partner before he can be added to your plan. "
HealthInsurance,"Pre-existing conditions were before ACA. Thanks to Obamacare it should have no effect on your premiums now. "
HealthInsurance,"Correct. You will owe the doctor not the insurance "
HealthInsurance,You're most welcome!  Congratulations and best wishes to you and your wife :)
HealthInsurance,Did they mean their malpractice insurance? I dont see how rising insurance costs would be money out of their pocket. Unless they meant the plans they were offering their employees?
HealthInsurance,"Just to clarify, I should use the difference to hit the deductible, not the OOP maximum. I'll do that. Would take less than a month to hit that number."
HealthInsurance,"Ethics aside, the two concerns are going to be:

1. If you don't pay, they'll report you didn't have insurance that month.  If something doesn't work out at this new job you'll have already used up one month of ""not having insurance"" against the penalty.
2. Doctors will be told you haven't paid up, and you may have trouble getting them to accept your insurance.  They aren't going to take you at your word that you're going to pay the insurance company later, they'll likely treat you like an uninsured patient.  You'll probably need to pay up and make sure the insurance company has updated your record before you try and see a doctor."
HealthInsurance,"As far as the rest, I honestly don't know if there's some sort of shared blacklist of people who were once denied somewhere that other companies would have access to.  It's more likely that whatever they flagged you for was so serious it wasn't something they could deal with as a pre-existing condition (did you tell them you juggle chainsaws and catch them with your teeth or something  similarly hazardous that hasn't seriously harmed you ***yet***?)"
HealthInsurance,"Many plans exclude maintenance drugs from the deductible.

Call your insurance though, all we can do is guess."
HealthInsurance,"If you have one of these, you can apply now via coveredCA:
https://www.coveredca.com/individuals-and-families/getting-covered/special-enrollment/qualifying-life-events/

You can also apply if your income is low enough to qualify for medicaid.

You can also usually apply for short-term, indemnity or health sharing plans anytime. These are not major medical/qualified health plans and come with some serious drawbacks, but they are usually better than nothing.

The next open enrollment period starts 11/1 and you will be able to enroll in a plan for a 1/1/2019 effective date."
HealthInsurance,"Yes, I get this all the time with different insurance companies for my clients and there's really nothing that can be done about it, unless you happen to have your practice outside of a city. If there's anyway to claim ""rural"" status, you'd be able to side step this blanket statement. 

You can also look into becoming a member of a group third party payor that handles multiple insurance companies (that would need to include Aetna, obviously) if you get in with them, then you can have that access to all the plans they carry/hold. At least, that is how it worked for some of my clients in Arizona."
HealthInsurance,"I read your original thread and I have a few thoughts. 

1. Definitely DO NOT PAY ANY MEDICAL BILLS.

2. Call the actual provider that is sending you these letters, ask them why they are sending them to you. Has BCBS sent them ANY letters or correspondance on why they haven't paid the bills?

3. Call BCBS and ask them, have you received these claims? How did you process them?

That's it, end of story, based on the answers you get from the above I would be happy to tell you exactly what would need to be done next. 

The complaints you filed are not going to get you anywhere due to it being Medicare related, there is no recourse with that avenue. 

However, if you do steps 2 and 3, or already have the answers for 2 and 3, reply back with the answers and I'll (or someone else, I'm sure) can help you finally resolve this issue. 

Last, but not least, DO NOT PAY ANY BILLS.  However, it sounds like they (the provider) are not actually billing you, just wanting your help in getting the claims paid. That does happen all the time. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Individual plans with nation-wide coverage certainly do exist, though they tend to be more expensive, and not many companies offer them

No, they don't, actually. Not configured as you suggest. Not in America. But you keep insisting; maybe one will just spring into being"
HealthInsurance,"I see, i'm in Oklahoma.

Thank you!"
HealthInsurance,I called the doctor and they were surprised it wasn't covered.  They said they'd contact the insurance company and deal with the lab company directly.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I want to make sure I'm covered if I have an accident or something.
 
re: travel health coverage, look for the terms concerning transportation back to US. Also, look at coverage available through your credit card company(s) - and then see how coverage from ""external sources coordinates with that coverage. Goal is not to replicate coverage provisions from your various existing sources &amp; only buy what additional protection you feel might be helpful.

&gt; If I make no money, I have to pay with post-tax dollars as I would have with the non-hdhp plan. If I make some money, I can put it into the HSA and pay with pre-tax dollars. Am I missing something?

No, not missing any important thing. $ has to be in your account to use it (**H**SA is not like **F**SA in that way), but you could do what you've described. [IRS Publication 969](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf) covers the tax ins &amp; outs of HSAs

Family of 4 in TN (Montgomery county) making 85k qualifies for SIGNIFICANT premium credits - approximately $1000/month.

if you're fairly healthy, your coverage choice may boil down to the cost of your coverage - oversimplifying, the lower the better"".

Cost of course is MORE than your premiums (or in the case of your employer-sponsored coverage, your contributions). You need to compare plans on their TOTAL cost of coverage, which entails doing some prediction of how much CARE you'll be buying during the next year, and each choice's cost to you for that.

[Here's an illustration of how to compute and compare total cost of coverage for your coverage choices](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif). You can get as granular or as complex as you choose to; there's no one ""right"" answer, mostly because - spoiler alert - predicting how much care you'll actually consume in the next 12 months is an exercise in uncertainty. Unfortunately - spoiler alert #2 - there's very few ways to eliminate this uncertainty, maybe only ONE way, and, well, the alternative is almost always preferable."
HealthInsurance,"No. Your deductibles are low. Catastrophic coverage has high deductibles. If you're insured through work, it's pretty much never a catastrophic plan. Catastrophic plans are only available to people under 30 or who qualify for ACA financial hardship exemptions."
HealthInsurance,"Yes, this is very much starting to become a thing. Families are pricing each member of the family out individually, considering their individual health needs, and then putting each different family member on a different plan, and sometimes even a different company. Employer healthcare for spouses and other dependents is no longer as generous as it used to be."
HealthInsurance,Do your paystubs show that as a line item deduction from your total salary?
HealthInsurance,it was probably 6k. The thing is - she could be getting the reduced insurance negotiated rate for services if she had insurance.  As it stands she's using the clinic and paying retail for anything that's not a subsidized service. The retail cost vs negotiated cost is extreme. Not to mention the discount she'd get on RX.
HealthInsurance,"What are you going to tell the urgent care, your insurer is driving you crazy and you want a mental health check?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;he hates ACA

&gt;thinks that as this is a pre-existing condition he can't get the service he needs.
"
HealthInsurance,"Is illincare the state or is it a 3rd party insurance company? I can understand the hassle if you were trying to deal with the state entity but if this is a 3rd party then theres no excuse. 

To be blunt:

You shouldnt have to submit shit to them. They should have a department that can call the other insurance they think you have and verify it themselves simply by you requesting it on a phone call. That really sucks youre getting such a run around on a very very common issue. Good luck and if you get the opportunity to switch insurance companies then i would"
HealthInsurance,"You can't get anything though your employer, correct? 

Taking the penalty is an option, but it's definitely risky. Unfortunately, in this day and age, the $400 you mentioned is pretty standard.

If you do go without insurance, sign up for goodrx (Google), it will save you money on prescriptions. "
HealthInsurance,On the marketplace website get the cheapest plan with a $6k deductible and pray that you never have to use it
HealthInsurance,No. Pre-existing conditions aren’t a problem as long as you haven’t had a lapse in coverage.
HealthInsurance,"Not saying that at all.  I'm saying that there are way too many unknown variables for anyone on Reddit to give you precise answers.  The best we can offer are educated guesses.  You will have to work with your doctors to develop a treatment plan.  Then you and your doctors need to work with the insurance company.

The best advice we can give to you going in is to do your homework with your insurance coverage and always, whenever possible, use in-network providers (always check this direct with your insurer, never take the doctor's office word for it)."
HealthInsurance,Do yourself a favor and educate yourself by reading a newspaper.
HealthInsurance,"No issues. Get your knees fixed with no worries... just make sure you stay In Network! "
HealthInsurance,"I'm not a pro in this area, but I know if they don't cover a medical visit or procedure it doesn't count against the out of pocket limits or the deductible.  The only thing that counts against those are items that would have been paid for by the insurance company if the deductible was satisfied.  I'd presume medicine would be the same, but don't know for sure.  That would be a good question in checking out which, if any, policy would work for you."
HealthInsurance,"I can't answer specifically regarding the percentages, what you should expect to pay (percentage wise) of your salary, but a healthcare plan for $350 on the silver tier has a deductible, but it usually has copays for normal office visits, the deductible is usually just for outpatient things (labwork, xrays, hospital, etc)

I would get the policy. You're required by law to have health insurance or you will pay a financial penalty. Plus, you'll have insurance, you'd be covered and safe if something were to happen to you. You're already experiencing some problems, so why risk your health to simply not have another bill to pay. 

I can't stress enough how important health insurance is, you never know when you'll need it, but you'll be glad that you do when you do need it. "
HealthInsurance,"If you lose coverage, it will open up a special enrollment period to sign up through the exchange."
HealthInsurance,"Oh, [Enroll Virginia](http://www.enrollva.org) is great! It talks about enrollment a lot on their website, but this time of year they help with a lot of issues like what you’re experiencing. "
HealthInsurance,"My explanation of benefits shows that nothing is being paid out directly by insurance, as I have not yet met my deductible.  It is my understanding that preventative services like the Hep B immunization are legally required to be covered 100% regardless of deductible.

Can you explain more about what you mean by ""paid at the line level"" and ""bundled together at a DRG?""  This is all very new to me."
HealthInsurance,"Can you give any insight into the Bureaucratic issue? "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for clarify, I just checked and yes I'll have to pay like 45$ for the visit.

The problem is that I have no idea how much the lenses could cost. Do you think the doctor will inform me about all the costs before ordering them?"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"You should be able to - it's best to contact your plan to see if there are any restrictions out-of-state. "
HealthInsurance,"I love your letter, it's clear, precise and unemotional. However, I fear that it's not going to be enough. When a policy has a maximum number of visits for a certain treatment, that is usually it, there is no more, that is in your benefits. However, it absolutely does not hurt to appeal. What you should also have though, that would have a lot more pull and sway than just your letter, is a letter from your Dr. as well. Show this letter to your Dr. and ask him/her to write one as well showing how they believe it is medically necessary and go from there. 

It's unfortunate, but I will be blunt and say that the odds of you getting more visits approved will be a tough fight. I wish you GL though. "
HealthInsurance,"Contact the lawyer who handled your divorce. "
HealthInsurance,"Unfortunately yeah, that's why I don't want it. I don't want to have to go to the hospital they want me to. With Anthem, I can pick any of my city's hospitals. 

I'm still in the country, in the same state even.  I've just moved to a new \*county\*. "
HealthInsurance,"Sounds about right, I'm in my 50's and the cheapest I can get is $1700/mo. No way I can afford that."
HealthInsurance,"Both plans need to be made aware of each other. Specifically, the plan where OP is a dependent needs to know he now has primary coverage so that they do not erroneously approve any claims that have not been first submitted to the plan where OP is the policyholder."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;you have 90 days to elect cobra.

No.

If OP is eligible for COBRA \-big\-ish if \- he'd have 60 days from the date he receives notice of his COBRA rights to make the election, and another 45 days to pay his first premiums for  it.

BUT.

I'm not sure he'd be COBRA eligible in this scenario. I'm not sure failing to make an election to avoid a default ""opt out"" election would trigger COBRA eligibility. Come forth, r/healthinsurance COBRA experts, and clear up this mystery"
HealthInsurance,"Older people really got the shaft with the ACA. The only thing they can use to make your rates higher is age. It's just a broader type of pre-existing conditions. 

Doesn't matter that you are extremely healthy and will probably not have health problems for another 15 years, they have to now pool your age group to determine a rate, so you have to pay astronomically due to everyone else that hasn't done jack for their health. "
HealthInsurance,"be very specific with your appeal when it comes to who told you it was covered and when you spoke with them.  You could also check with your HR to see if they have a contact with UHC that can help.

I can all but guarantee that call was recorded, and most insurance companies have a policy to make exceptions when inaccurate info is given when it can be proven.  short of that, your last possible avenue for resolution could be to involve the state insurance commissioner.  "
HealthInsurance,"I had this happen... It is really messed up.  Best you can do is appeal for a special enrollment, but that probably wont work.  Next is get a short term major medical if she doesn't have a lot of pre-existing. "
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,Call up a local independent agent. They will know the market.
HealthInsurance,"Preface: I have worked in facility reimbursement. Designing/modeling contracts for hospital/hospital systems

GENERALLY, outpatient claims are contract at the line level. There are many different ways an outpatient claim allowed amount (contracted amount) is calculated but usually we reimburse at the line level (specific immunizations or services) 

GENERALLY, an inpatient claim is bundled into a rate for the whole stay. This can be based on days (per diem) or on DRG. DRG stands for diagnosis related group. For example, on a maternity claim paid DRG two people could receive different amounts of drugs or one could go home a day early and the allowed amount would be the same because it was calculated at the service level. "
HealthInsurance,"My employer does enrollment in November so I think that's for next year. I really don't think the penalty is something I can afford, I hope I can still least get an exemption. "
HealthInsurance,"Okay- figured it out with BCBS, but for anyone in the future- it does mean BCBS of other states.

Depends on plan, but for the PPO, if it says BCBS of ___ state, it works for all BCBS.  *Broadly speaking always double check this*"
HealthInsurance,"Interesting, thank you - my provider has a really good local reputation on top of all the appropriate certifications &amp; licenses (Mayo refers people to her, etc). Yet she’s applied multiple times to be in network and always gets turned down. I’ve wondered if this is an exception or the norm for them."
HealthInsurance,"It is becoming more common. Basically as long as she has access to any other employer sponsored plan she cannot join your plan she must take her employer’s plan. If she were to even leave or quit her job then this would be a qualifying event and could join your plan as she lost coverage. "
HealthInsurance,"I'm not sure what you mean ""their claim"" and ""our claim""  If you've got two claims that were sent by the same doctor to the same insurance company, there should be two EOBs on your insurance company's website (if they don't have a website, call and ask for the EOBs).  The amount charged on the claim minus the adjustment leaves the ""allowed amount"" which is what the doctor's contract allows them to collect.

This, of course, assumes the doctor is a contracted, in-network provider.  If he had dropped out of the network between those two claims then he can collect whatever he pleases (though you should still have an EOB from the insurance company saying that he's out of network)."
HealthInsurance,Where did you hear they have up to 15 months for review?
HealthInsurance,"It's student insurance, but I'm a graduate student. It does cover most things in general, and the rest of the exclusions seemed pretty normal to me (plastic surgery, stuff like that). I also work in health care and regularly deal with insurance and I've literally never come across this in 7 years of dealing with insurance. Sure, most insurances have VERY specific guidelines for CPAPs/etc, but I don't have sleep apnea, I have narcolepsy. I don't even need another sleep study (which is generally the expensive part), I just need to see my specialist and be medicated :( 

I contacted my school health office and someone is going to talk to our health office admin/unitedhealth rep to see what can be done about it. I don't really have a lot of hope, but anything through the health marketplace is worse (too high deductible or monthly cost) and I can't work full time as a graduate student, most of my week is taken up by clinical/my project/schoolwork. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes - once your income is relatively known, you should be able to update your income. Depending on how much your new income is, you might still qualify for MediCal or you might need to enroll into a different plan, but the updating of your income SHOULD be the event that triggers that change. If things take a while to ramp up, you could consider making the change over from MediCal to potential new insurance coincide with the new year (enroll in November/December timeframe for a 1/1/19 effective date). Good luck!"
HealthInsurance,"My understanding has been to submit both insurances and let the carriers sort it out. This is good to know, thank you. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I can't get my Humira without insurance from what I was told.

you can get it \- but without insurance, you'll likely pay more for it than you like \(&amp; maybe even WITH insurance you'd pay more than you like\)"
HealthInsurance,"It's soooo awesome. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, appreciate it, hopefully in about a week I'll find out"
HealthInsurance,I'ts not income.
HealthInsurance,"Yes it is, I've been putting $50 a month in there for a year now"
HealthInsurance,"healthcare.gov and fill out the forms.    
One would think that salary would put you firmly into Medicaid territory but wait until you see a pay stub and know the firm numbers."
HealthInsurance,"Apply for Medicaid pregnancy is covered no matter your income "
HealthInsurance,"Not to be rude but how late was the payment and have you missed many payments before? Usually insurance companies won't drop after just one late payment, some providers have grace periods for this. Did you get it on the marketplace? "
HealthInsurance,Was the week of maternity leave paid or unpaid?  Not sure that would make a difference but someone else may know.
HealthInsurance,*Medicaid
HealthInsurance,"And yes deductible. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"&gt; You have a grace period to make your first payment anyways

Uh, I would not count on this. I would be very surprised to see a grace period on a binder payment."
HealthInsurance,"None of the carriers we offer refuse to offer coverage to people with anxiety/depression, so that's definitely not an across the board underwriting question. Keep trying. There should be options out there for you!"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"You’ve pretty much hit the nail on the head. One thing I would add on: a few old-school HMO plans still require an actual referral from the selected pcp, especially Medicaid, but most blue cross plans no longer require referrals; patients can now self-refer. You still have to see in-network providers to receive benefits, but pcp referrals through the insurance company aren’t a requirement unless it’s on your insurance card and in your summary of benefits. I would suggest checking with your human resources department and ask for a summary of coverage. It will state if referrals are required as part of the plan. "
HealthInsurance,"Haha, “rising insurance costs” means these providers would make more money! Has to be malpractice or maybe P&amp;C costs for their building? "
HealthInsurance,"Does your employer offer a high deductible plan? What type of plan would be the most affordable through your employer? I’m wondering if the PPO plans are self-funded and they are trying to lower their costs by mapping to certain plans. Your HMO plan doesn’t happen to be through Kaiser, does it? "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; You might as well add this as your monthly payment 

You pay your ""monthly payment"" \- your premium \- every month, whether or not you have any treatment, buy any medication, etc.

You pay some or all of your deductible ***only*** when you are presented a bill for treatment/Rx/etc to which that deductible applies. In theory, deductibles can help insurers avoid claims for which you don't really need to have your  insurance pay. In *theory*...."
HealthInsurance,"I am not sure they would share the cost of your pre existing pregnancy. You should look into that. If you think you can get new jobs fairly quickly, just sign up for the COBRA. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;so there is/was no reasoning as to why she wouldn't still qualify for Medicaid to be the supplement/secondary to her new Medicare.

Dual eligibility is a good thing, but a complicated thing \(whether more complicated than it needs to be is a subject for its own thread, or forum, or maybe internet... ;\-\)\) . the 'generosity' of the Medicaid/Medicare intersection varies from state to state and/or from income level to income level. 

Your response to OP was solid, but for OP to give Gran more help at a granular level, s/he needs to get more, well, granular, is all"
HealthInsurance,"Agreed, it took me 3 appeals and threatening to put in an appeal with state insurance commission to finally get my claim partially paid. I cited the specific calls and had all my documentation but uhc kept fighting me till they finally cAved Keep trying, don’t give up. 

Insurance is a scam "
HealthInsurance,"I think that if it isn't in your records, it is not pre existing but I am just a guy on the internet. "
HealthInsurance,"You're really in a pickle here. I would suggest finding a cheap catastrophic plan that at least keeps her covered in the even of anything major happening, they are usually way cheaper than the health plan. However, there may be tax penalties (not too familiar with how that works, exactly, not my forte.) or you're going to have to fork over the $2K per month. Your best bet may be to find a local insurance broker in your area, explain to him/her what happened and see what they can find for her. "
HealthInsurance,Plus it is instant - same day. Only positive pregnancy test needed.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I'm not even sure why it's so expensive through my employer

lacking details, my hunch is 

* you're  50 or over 
* your employer is applying age\-related or age\-banded premium rates
* your employer is not subsidizing your coverage costs much, if at all
* your employer has selected unusually generous benefit designs
* there's some other employee benefits lumped in with your medical coverage contribution \(dental benefits? vision? long\-term disability? Other?\)
* some combination of the above"
HealthInsurance,"Eye glasses. "
HealthInsurance,"My condolences on your loss. 

I would suggest finding a catastrophic insurance plan in case anything major happens to you before you're enrolled (enrolling in December for January coverage). Pay cash rates if you need to go to doctor's office, but just try to ride it out until you're eligible to apply and enroll in ACA approved health insurance plans. "
HealthInsurance,"That's a good point. I figured it would be more expensive to do it that way, assuming the cost of weekly appointments, but maybe not. I'll look into it a bit more, thanks."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the help, appreciate it! I spoke with someone in the pharmacy department for Aetna and they informed me that I have a deductible for prescription drugs that is 125 dollars. I wondered why I have never had to hit it before and they said it’s a policy change in my plan as of May 1st. 

Seems very weird to me that this would change in May which doesn’t seem to corispond to the month I got insurance or any other significant dates one would imagine for an insurance company to change policies. It also seems weird that as far as I can tell I was never informed that my coverage was changing either via mail or electronically, and there’s no way to see the deductible she mentioned on their website. And also that my new prescription deductible is apparently almost exactly the cost of a month’s supply of my prescription.

That said, I am inclined to just pay it,  I am fortunate enough that a surprise $125 expense is not super painful and would probably seem totally reasonable to me if it weren’t sprung on me by my pharmacist at pickup time. But I’m slightly worried she just made up this deductible to get me off the phone and next month I will randomly be out 300 dollars out of pocket and stuck trying to convince a huge conglomerate they need to mail me 270 dollars.

"
HealthInsurance,"Don't use the ER unless you have to. It's the most expensive option and you won't get very good care. A better option would be start with a community health center (CHC). Find your's states CHC organization here: http://www.nachc.org/about-nachc/state-affiliates/state-regional-pca-listing/ and then use them/their website to find a CHC in your area. These are organizations that are usually designed for folks without insurance and will save you a bundle compared to walking into an ER with a non-emergency issue.

As for other options for you to actually get insurance, If you're a single healthy adult with no dependents in a state that expanded medicaid then usually the upper threshod is $1400/month. Unless you can show that your income was lower for the last 30-60 days then you're probably not going to get medicaid for healthy adults (there are other types).  That said, see if you have a qualifying life event ([here's a list](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/)). If you do have a qualifying life event, apply by Monday as that may be a deadline day for you to get a May 1st effective date and you should be able to get a very inexpensive plan with low out of pocket costs (look at silver plans). If you don't have a qualifying life event, then check out a community health center and be sure to apply for a plan for 2019 during the next open enrollment period starting in November.

"
HealthInsurance,"yeah, yours is a pretty unusual - and unfortunate - situation. Feels like you're on the most economical track with your original strategy - that is, if there's no making your employer see the light in terms of the financial jam it's put you in"
HealthInsurance,locate clinics near you with [something like this](http://www.healthcare311.com)
HealthInsurance,"I don’t think that’s correct - for plans that use the NAIC model [rules](https://www.ctww.org/html/hsspd-001200.htm)  (which I think is most/all plans), the plan where the beneficiary is an employee is primary over a plan where they’re a dependent. "
HealthInsurance,"I applied to the .gov insurances. Most of them quoted me 6k for a skeletal plan. Literally covered nothing if anything at all. 
The more costly the more it offered but as I stated  she makes 30K a year, and I'm not wealthy were I can just flat out covered it all.

Molina covers none of her current doctors and only a handful of doctors/specialist cover. 
I looked trust me. I'm trying to see if anyone has any advice I haven't found. Something. Anything. 

I'll have to wait till fall. "
HealthInsurance,Your doctor
HealthInsurance,"Check into USAA, as a veteran with dependents. "
HealthInsurance,"It says coverage starts the first of the month following the WP.

A friend of mine told me that his coverage kicked in retroactively after those 30 days and i never heard of such a thing!"
HealthInsurance,"Was it from an In-Network provider? Have you contacted your insurance company? 

Most contracts with insurance companies (between the plan and the doctor) have a limit of 90 days for professional claims and 120 days for facility claims for them to submit a claim to the insurance company (MOST). They also cannot “balance bill” you... I.e. they have to take what the insurance company pays them and cannot bill you extra (outside of copays, deductibles, coinsurance). "
HealthInsurance,"Ugh I’m afraid of the very same thing. Just started on an exchange plan and already annoyed because they want me to pay April (which I didn’t even get to use because I have no ID info from them) and May. I just got the bill in the mail yesterday and it’s due Monday 4/30. 

Do you have a way to record phone calls? I would call Cigna back and immediately ask for a supervisor (you can explain why). Cigna is huuuuge so they probably have high turnover in their lower positions so lots of stuff gets messed up and it’s often up to the consumer to catch mistakes. Good luck!"
HealthInsurance,"Switch your pcp. You can do it once a month.  And yes,  networks are usually a mess"
HealthInsurance,"Pretty much every sentence of this is incorrect -- I don't say that to be mean, but because I don't want OP to be mis-informed.

-Medi-cal doesn't go by income on income taxes, but by income in the month of application. OP, you are free to say you have no income, but you will have to sign the forms on penalty of perjury.

-Short term plans are the opposite of comprehensive coverage. Medi-cal is way more comprehensive.

-Short-term plans do not count as coverage for the individual mandate.

OP, I guess you could buy a full-price plan outside of covered CA and not file taxes if you wanted. You may be eligible for financial assistance with premiums if you buy through covered CA (although your husband's income will be taken into account), but you have to file taxes if you get financial assistance."
HealthInsurance,"This helps tremendously, thank you! I don't have set hours for my new job, but I'm thinking it'll be like 30 a week. So once I start at that job the next step wouldl be to update my income, right?"
HealthInsurance,"If it helps, UHC has a policy that you can ask to speak to someone ""State Side"" to get someone in the states and not a customer service rep in India or other foreign country that they outsourced too. I do this when I feel like I'm not getting anywhere. 

I hope you chose tomorrow. Take the rest of today off. ;)"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;you don't do this sort of thing on a regular basis, do you?

Nope, not at all lol. And to add to my confusion, I keep getting calls from companies like Multiplan offering me a PPO with no deductible and only $250/month plus an enrollment fee. As clueless as I am about all of this, I'm smelling something fishy about these callers. 

&gt; but regarding the ACA marketplace, are you sure you've confirmed the person you're helping is not eligible for premium credits? 

I don't think so but I'm gonna look into that.

&gt; Also, why does she need such a low deductible with household income of $70k? She'll be Medicare eligible within months. 

Yeah, I've been trying to explain to her it's probably better to find something with a higher deductible. However, it seems the lowest deductible we can find for a reasonable premium is about $10K or $11K. She has about 11 months to go until she can jump on Medicare and she doesn't want to spend that much money if she does have to end up needing any expensive medical service during those months. "
HealthInsurance,Thank you so much!!
HealthInsurance,"There is no way they will honor a different insurance company’s deductible. The money you spent towards a deductible with the previous company is completely useless to the new one.  Cobra would be your only bet for something like that. "
HealthInsurance,"Nope. You’ll have to keep it until you have a qualifying event (have a kid, lose your job, get married, etc) or until open enrollment comes back when you can cancel. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"No they didn't, so it looks like somehow they were never received."
HealthInsurance,"Costs are rising, but medical care is so expensive in the U.S. that the prospect of not having it and needing medical care makes it almost more necessary if you are poor."
HealthInsurance,"Not that new to the States but currently waiting for my husband to change jobs, thats why we're getting pregnant after January. He will probably be offered insurance with his employer,  I just don't know if what they are going to give him will be a good option to add his soon to be pregnant wife to it, so it would be nice to know what plan I can get in North Carolina, or how much I can expect to pay for premium and how much will I end up paying myself for my c-sectiob, pre-natal care, etc."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"If they are in-network then they can't balance bill you. That's not how the network negotiations work. I think you need to escalate with your insurance and make them aware that a network partner is balance billing. And potentially this might need to go to your state insurance board as well. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! That’s good info. I think from what I saw they have different levels of help, where they can at least cover some of medical insurance that’s not necessarily Medicaid so I’m hoping that works because I’ll be scraping by on savings for a bit. 

Thanks!"
HealthInsurance,"If i wanted to cover them thru private or exchange i would need to modify court order to say that
 Its dumb that at the time i was divorced kuds were covered under employer a but i got private when i moved to employer b because it was cheaper!!! And now im having yo fucking pay 600 for me and the kids because employer b has to follow the court order at the time. If i movr to a new employer i need to modify court order to say i can get health insurance privately or thru exchange OR new employer"
HealthInsurance,"He already makes much more than average for his age at his current job. The only thing that would pay more that he is qualified for is oil filed work, which at this point looks like we may be considering. I am not qualified for much of anything, and we are trying to avoid this if at all possible "
HealthInsurance,"Pickle indeed :\(. Thanks, I'll look into a catastrophic plan, hopefully that's different from the short\-term plan mentioned in a comment above. I thought Trump rescinded the individual mandate or whatnot? I'll have to look into the tax penalties. I'm more concerned about liabilities against assets atm though. It's looking like I couldn't even get the 2k/mo option even if that was affordable, due to enrollment period. I'll try to reach out to a few brokers and see if they can suggest anything. Thanks again."
HealthInsurance,"Um, you need to eat that damn donut before it goes stale and to waste! Shame on you for that!

Glad you're getting feeback, even if it is through social shaming, unfortunately, that's just the way it seems to go these days. "
HealthInsurance,"You are always eligible for a plan. Its only checking for your eligibility for the premium tax credit. I would call the 1-800 number and speak directly to someone who can assist you in checking out plans and enrollment. Get the plan to start for June 1st, regardless of the amount of tax credit, you may or may not get. You have a grace period to make your first payment anyways so at least this way you have coverage on the first and are not locked out until July 1st."
HealthInsurance,What did you end up deciding?
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Technically yes you need to let them know you moved... 

And by this we mean you are obligated to do so, because keeping a plan you are not eligible for could make you guilty of insurance fraud, and tax fraud if there are tax credits involved."
HealthInsurance,"Do you have proof of payment for the 4th and 5th month? If you do, great! You have a leg to stand on, if you don't, then you're only option is to contact COBRA, let them know that you sent the payments but the checks never cleared, so ask if you can send a payment that gets you caught up, pay for month 4 and 5 and current month and they will retro re-instate you, IF they allow you to do this.  

Otherwise, there is NO plan that would ever retro actively pay any healthcare claims that you incurred while un-insured EXCEPT some states Medicaid programs. "
HealthInsurance,"Where did you get the $120 number for the prescription? Sounds like that may be the cash price, and you’re just getting the CVS Caremark contracted discount for that particular med."
HealthInsurance,"I current have a HDHP and the two drugs I take monthly not only have no deductible but are free to me as well. No cost at all. Hidden in the Explanation of Benefits is a note about certain prescription meds being excluded from the deductible with a link that takes me to a page that shows how much I'll be charged for some specific medications and within that is a section for $0 cost drugs....I was surprised too but I'm not complaining. "
HealthInsurance,"When I login to my health insurance website, I can see all prescription claims (including the prescriptions for my kids). The website also sends me a notification via email any time a claim has been processed. 

To be honest, I can see how this is fair. I pay for the premiums, deductibles, out of pocket costs, I should be able to see what I’m paying for. 

I guess it could not hurt to call the insurance hotline and see what can be done (I.e HIPAA). "
HealthInsurance,"I've seen analysis that it would cost less than our current system, but cover everyone with better care. Can't get much better than that. Can't get much worse than our current system.  "
HealthInsurance,"I'm thinking about doing that- my hours go up and down based on how busy the theater is. I range between 28 to 36 hours a week. My average is usually 32 hours, which is low enough to keep me in range. Again, the problem is that we're hitting a busy time in the movie business."
HealthInsurance,And yet politics shape these difficult healthcare experiences... You can’t separate one from the other.
HealthInsurance,"Honestly,  I think they did it correctly (because I work two part time jobs) but I still can't afford it. "
HealthInsurance,"I'm under my mom's insurance, and I recently had a blood test. My mom could see online exactly what it was for and the cost, etc. I would assume it's the same for the medication."
HealthInsurance,"So even if I got diagnosed, I'll still have to look like this?"
HealthInsurance,"Good point. I work in employee benefits, and when Anthem was my claims administrator, it was possible."
HealthInsurance,"Did the insurance company tell you that these providers were in-network? I ask because sometimes the hospital and the physicians group do not necessarily have contracts with the same insurance companies. 
Also, most hospitals have Patient Advocates, or something similarly worded.  In my experience, I get farther with these people rather than the billing department directly.  
Also, I hate to say it, but bringing this to attention on social media seems to get a response sooner anymore.  "
HealthInsurance,"Providers are paid based on procedure codes which follow fee schedules. There’s no way that your insurance company would ever negotiate a small claim like that just because you hit your deductible. The overhead alone on a process like that would be way to expensive. With that said, i bet that it’s a difference procedure code... keep in mind that office visit codes can be based on the amount of time that the doctor spends with the patient.  So if you went in for the same procedure but spent 30 mins with you rather than 45 mins they could and would be paid more for the 45 mins visit. "
HealthInsurance,"I would contest the bill with the provider's office. In writing, very concise and precise, that you had called on the morning of the appointment and were told by the front office that they accepted your plan and that you were obligated to pay a $30 copay. 

To be fair, it IS the patient's responsibility to verify if the doctor you are seeing is in YOUR network, but because you were told by the front office staff, if you write a nice, but firm, letter to them letting them know that they made a mistake, they may be willing to write off the amount that is due, minus the $30 copay. 

A letter from a professional patient advocacy company may help you get this easier than just a letter from yourself, but that would be a decision to make on your own. "
HealthInsurance,Do you have one?
HealthInsurance,"Dunno if you've resolved this, but CoveredCA sends forms 1095A's which would show CoveredCA enrollment. Medi-Cal sends forms 1095B's to show Medi-cal enrollment. There may be some confusion here, as you are asking for 1095A forms but it sounds like you had only Medi-Cal, which means you actually need a 1095B. 

Technically, you shouldn't need either form to actually file your taxes (it's just a check box on the paperwork asking if you had sufficient coverage, most of the time you don't actually need to turn anything in) but since your accountant/IRS told you you need it, I would re-request the 1095B from Medi-Cal.

You can also request a Passport To Services, which shows essentially the same thing as a 1095B, but not sure if your accountant would be satisfied with that. 

Regarding proof from Kaiser... I have no idea which form they use, but you might want to contact Kaiser if they haven't sent you a form and you also had coverage from them. "
HealthInsurance,What state do you live in?  When did your wife lose coverage?  What's your estimated income for the year?
HealthInsurance,"That's not patient driven care. I can't speak on Aetna's policies, but I would imagine that they also have a policy regarding out of network charges that you have no control over. Just call their customer service on the back of your card and ask if they can adjust the claim to pay since you had no way of knowing that the labwork would be sent out of network."
HealthInsurance,"Make sure who ever you get the crutches through is in network. Urgent care most likely uses a third party supplier. Dr there could write, you a script for crutches if you need to go to an in network durable medical equipment provider. "
HealthInsurance,"Where can I find this?
"
HealthInsurance,"Tennessee sucks because it didn't expand Medicaid, so you get punished by your state representatives. 


And for clarity, sharing minstries and the like are not insurance

Community clinics may be a stopgap option for some kinds of routine non-emergency attention. [Find local centers here](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/)"
HealthInsurance,"Good points. I did notice the one doc daily in hospital, though some plans are two. My dad was in hospital for months with multiple docs daily but their quick visits were only 50-75 negotiated on Medicare, though they billed triple that. Cost him nothing. Question is whether I still get negotiated rates after first doc daily or would that go away for next few daily docs that I’d have to pay. Have to ask. As for prescription same basic question for them as to discounted rates after 12 yearly.  I think it has discount card too beyond the 12 covered. I can afford to cover prescriptions but I think there are add on drug plans I may look into.  Also that cancer plan I mentioned also pays for heart and stroke so would go a long way towards doc visits in hospital unless it’s for another issue.  Also I would have my 7300  current plan deductible disappear which would go s long way towards all of above. Bottom line is it’s tricky. "
HealthInsurance,"They’re going to claim you didn’t have a proper referral and that’s why it’s not covered. The denial happens automatically, the claim system sees the code on the claim checks for the referral and then denies it.

This may be very easy to overturn just by having a human look at the claim. When you call explain everything you just explained to us. Tell the insurer you didn’t have time to go to your PCP because your 3 year was bleeding from the face. Tell them you knew an emergency room visit wasn’t necessary because it wasn’t life threatening. That really should be enough. "
HealthInsurance,"If you lose your insurance usually that is an event that will allow you to sign up for insurance during a ""special enrollment"" period, meaning you can enroll while not during open enrollment.

You may be able to get insurance either through your work or via the Obamacare marketplace or from an insurance company directly via their website."
HealthInsurance,Page 40 pertains to your situation. The standard grace period is 31 days and typically not flexible.  Do you get a subsidy to help pay for coverage? If you do it looks like your grace period could be up to 90 days.
HealthInsurance,I'm assuming based on this info that you are on a high deductible style plan and/or have coinsurance and haven't met your deductible yet which is why you are paying $107.
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! That's exactly what I needed to know. 
If they don't send it to me, is there any recourse?"
HealthInsurance,"$70K this year. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"It's the same coverage you have now, without any premium subsidy that might be kicked in by your employer."
HealthInsurance,I would call Aetna and explain that an in network physician's office sent the labwork to an out of network lab.  They might tell you to fight it with the doc's office.  As an in network physician he's obligated (I'm not sure if required) to send it to an in network lab.
HealthInsurance,"I read up on snake bates/anitvenom a little, and I read the prices they quote on hospital bill are always hugely discounted once insurance company negotiates...and that implies it is covered by most companies. So not sure what the deal is with these people. Those half ass insurance plans aren't even legal with all the mandates now."
HealthInsurance,If you get the name of the insurance company I can research it for you.  :)
HealthInsurance,"Actually the out of pocket max does not always include the deductible. In some cases, only coinsurance applies to the out of pocket. This should be confirmed with your insurance company."
HealthInsurance,"The insurance probably called the doctors office to clarify and get a timestamp for when it was faxed so they could search better. Lowly phone reps at insurance companies dont care about threats to go to the doctor more. 


Also most PAs are done online and thus electronically faxed to the insurance, it could have been that it wasn't submitted fully until you called and then got an immediate denial for not having taken their formulary alternatives. There is often times a series of questions ""has patient tried formulary drugs X Y or Z"" if they answer no, then are asked ""is there a medical reason for them to not take X Y or Z"" if you answer no again 9x/10 you're gonna get a denial immediately. Its mostly algorithms that dictate the authorizations."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. 

We don't need any regular attention currently and also will not be in the country but traveling intly to places like south america and south east asia. We will get a travel plan to cover intl costs and repatriation in the event of something serious. And then be covered by the domestic insurance. It's expensive overall but we haven't found a better solution for our situation.

Ideally a catastrophic plan locally and a good plan overseas would make more sense. But we are both over 30 and from research, it appears these catastrophic plans are only for under-30 unless you have a hardship."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Are you saying I can't get the same kind of national coverage I have now through my employer with an individual policy?

Not exactly. I'm saying your employer-sponsored coverage may not be as generous as you imagine regarding coverage of treatment you obtain outside wherever you currently live. I'd need a peek at your Summary of Benefits &amp; Coverage (SBC) to know for sure. [Your SBC looks like this](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf), and your employer, or your employer's insurer, is obliged to provide you a copy, via their website or other means."
HealthInsurance,"In my area, usually these kinds of collections threats are just bluster and they drop it rather than trying to collect, but technically you owe up to the date the Marketplace terminated your plan. I definitely wouldn't pay for all of April as you don't owe anything past the 10th. You could pay go ahead and pay for March though. 

If Cigna is not showing that your policy is cancelled on the 10th of April, but the Marketplace is saying that it is, then report that to the Marketplace. Tell the Marketplace rep that Cigna is claiming they never received the cancellation request from the Marketplace and that you would like to create an escalation. Ask to speak to a supervisor if the representative doesn't go along with this. Don't try to sort this out with Cigna if they are reporting that they never received the cancellation request from the Marketplace."
HealthInsurance,"I do have a pre-existing condition--I take medication for anxiety/depression, and I divulged that of course--and I'm learning that they can flag me for that as a non ACA compliant plan. That's what got me the first time I applied (I thought it was the discrepency that I previously mentioned), and the second company I went with flagged me for having been denied before. I guess I'll just have to keep trying with companies but outlook is bleak for the time being. Thanks again for your comments."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;My plan doesn’t cover a gas station attendant waving crystals over my head.

we truly live in barren &amp; soulless times"
HealthInsurance,"Your post contains some ...unhelpful suggestions for OP.

&gt;3. Medishare type programs.

Medishare plans are not insurance, can involve application pre\-existing condition restrictions on coverage

&gt;4. Your will not likely be eligible for Medicaid because you are not 65 and order.

No. You may be thinking of MedicARE. Pennsylvania expanded MedicAID coverage for adults without children, , so this may be an option for OP.

&gt;5. ....Medicare is mostly reserved for the household income below poverty level 

You are DEFINITELY confusing MedicARE, a federal program introduced in 1965 as health coverage primarily for seniors, and MedicAID, which is  state run, primarily federally funded, needs\-based support for health treatment for people with low incomes and other challenging economic circumstances.

You get an A for effort, but you need to brush up, a LOT, on specifics"
HealthInsurance,That’s amazing. Definitely could save me a lot until I can hopefully figure something better out or win the lottery lol. Thank you for your help! :)
HealthInsurance,ugh fucking sucks.
HealthInsurance,Healthy non-smoker in Oregon
HealthInsurance,"&gt; it's totally possible that the doctor billed the insurance some crazy amount and the $361 is just a percentage of that.

[chart of average charges \(before insurance pays\) for US physician visits](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart/prices-increased-for-all-levels-of-outpatient-office-visits-including-the-least-severe-complex-cases-level-1-and-most-severe-complex-cases-level-5/#item-start). Even allowing for wide variation \- because there is wide variation \- $361 is on the crazy high end"
HealthInsurance," When I logon to my health insurance website I can see all my prescriptions. I don't have dependents now but I assume I would have been able to see theirs as well. 

Do what's right for you. Being independent can mean standing up for yourself to your parents. Plus you can always just put the blame on your doctors and your parents can't do anything about that."
HealthInsurance,Oh for real?? Thought that the updates to ACA since Trump was elected meant that premiums could be higher again for pre-existing conditions
HealthInsurance,"Being a stay at home mom is a huge financial sacrifice for many families. Even my friend whose husband makes 6 figures sometimes contemplated getting a part time job because kids are expensive! You could look into part time work you can do from home, like medical billing stuff. Then you wouldn’t need daycare. "
HealthInsurance,Oh yeah? Please explain! How would I get insurance if I don’t qualify for market place due to legality issues with my status
HealthInsurance,"It would be scenario 1, where $10 copay is my primary. So we’d assume $10 would just be applied to my secondary deductible!?
"
HealthInsurance,self-funded or fully-funded won't matter - COB rules are the same for both.
HealthInsurance,"Yes. Please realize that only the provider can change the codes!

I get so many people yelling at me (the insurance) because their provider billed “the wrong thing.” I can’t tell a doctor what procedure they performed. They have to tell me what they did. 

Maybe try asking for a copy of the filed claim from insurance and compare it to what your doctor says they did?"
HealthInsurance,"No, a catastrophic plan is a non-approved ACA plan that will only cover you in truly catastrophic emergency events, that way you are at least covered and won't go bankrupt if something serious happens. For anything else, you can just pay cash or go to the walk in clinics at pharmacy's, etc. Because they are non-approved ACA plans, there is no ""window"" you buy it, you get it. Then, once open enrollment starts, get on that plan and be covered so that you're not dinged financially with taxes, which by the way, you are already going to be. 

However, yes, if you can actually talk to someone at healthcare.gov and explain the situation, they may open registration for you earlier than open enrollment. "
HealthInsurance,"This is pretty common. At my old work, we did not have that policy originally. But then we were acquired by a much larger company whose name I won’t say but you know of. They did have that policy, and all of our employees whose spouses *could* get insurance through their own job lost coverage for said spouse as soon as we all signed up for insurance under the larger company, which happened pretty much right after acquisition. One guy quit because his wife’s work’s insurance sucked and she had health issues that required better coverage than what her work could offer. So, it sucks, but it is common. "
HealthInsurance,Coordination of benefits rules state that the plan that covers you as an employee will pay first. Any other plan covering you as a dependent would pay second. So no need to contact your parents' insurance since they are already set up to pay second for these situations!
HealthInsurance,This is happening. The tax cut bill included language expanding Medicare coverage options' latitude to cover teleclinician visits. Not sure if there are future dates on which the expanded latitude takes effect. Teh Google can probably tell you
HealthInsurance,"Step zero: find a way to qualify for a special enrollment period. Yeah, that's a tough one in your situation.

Step two: move out of Florida.

Florida, in its legislators' wisdom, did not take advantage of ACA provisions supporting an expansion of Medicaid coverage, so unless you can anticipate making MORE than about $12k annually, you would pay the full premium cost of ACA coverage, which won't be super expensive \- for health insurance \- but way more than $100/month.

Step three: [locate a community health center near you](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/). They might be able to supply the kind of health support your friend mentioned \- at low/no cost to you."
HealthInsurance,"Would certainly be nice if it is. Do you know if COBRA has the same restrictions as the marketplace? ie; signing up even though insurance is offered through current employer?

I guess I also need to figure out if the IRS could come after me if I use the COBRA and not what would technically be considered my MEC for my pay increase. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Well, this is....something, but not everything.

OP, does Grandma have any kind of income/assets? The level of assistance she gets with her coverage will depend on her income, and where she is \- what state. Different levels  of income, different levels of how much of her out\-of\-pocket coverage her Medicare &amp; Medicaid coverage takes care of. 

The important thing may NOT be to ""get her on a Plan D"" \(I believe IceT means a PART D standalone prescription drug plan; a ""plan D"" would be a term applied to Medicare Supplement coverage, which does NOT cover Rx\)  but to step back, understand her financial picture, and select the coverage that suits her circumstances most effectively. Drug coverage will likely play a role, but the best fit may NOT be a Plan D""."
HealthInsurance,"Really? So she’s just forced to have lesser insurance due to turning 65? That’s so sad. I don’t think she knows about the Part D stuff either. She didn’t even consider Medicare until someone told her she needed to sign up for it officially. I’ll look into this Part D thing and see what I can’t find out. She has so many health issues and not having her spiriva is already hurting her. She’s petrified.  
  
Thank you for your advice and warning. "
HealthInsurance,Does she qualify for Medicaid? I'm not familiar with NJ law.
HealthInsurance,"Because she's reached 65, she doesn't have a choice, Medicare kicks in and will now be her primary where Medicaid will continue on as her secondary. However, she needs to get on a Medicare drug plan, Part D (I'm assuming she's eligible and on  Part A (hospital) and Part B (physicians), she's also eligible for Part D (pharmacy) but needs to pick a plan for it. 

While you're doing this research, also be careful of finding Medicare Replacement Plans, these sometimes go under the guise of being Part D when in reality, they take over Part A and Part B as well and charge a high premium every month. You/her don't want this as she's Medicaid eligible. "
HealthInsurance,Medicare for All
HealthInsurance,"There are several options and the choices are made for based your affordablility and your health condition.  Consumption of high amount of alcohol, tabacco, sugar, low\-fiber vegetable diet, and low physical exercise contributes  your overall well being. 

1. Self Insured like Mark Cuban. If you have the money, no need to have insurance because you can afford those expenses and annual checkups. This is not the case for 99.999&amp;#37; of people.

2. Cobra or Major Medical is expensive. The current rate for a high deductible plan is about 10K/yr plus an 8K deductible with $40 co\-pay and 80/20 for prescriptions. All\-in is about 24K/yr for an individual.

3. Medishare type programs. There are several companies that offer this program. They run about 400/month. You need to look into the details of those plans.

4. Your will not likely be eligible for Medicaid because you are not 65 and order. 

5. Your will not likely be eligible Medicare unless you are collecting Social Security Disability Insurance. However, the best way to know for sure based your situation is talk to the social security office. Medicare is mostly reserved for the household income below poverty level or about 11k/yr per person.  If you work a 40 hour week, making $15/hr you will not qualify.

6. Purchase supplemental insurance. This is insurance for the big stuff like hospitalization, accidents, or cancer.  The two players in this business is Aflac and Colonial, Aflac being the much bigger of the two.  You still about 20&amp;#37; out of pocket expense with a monthly expense about $100.

7.  Total badass and take care of your body.  For men that are health at 26 will not have major medical issues until really pass 50.  You have annual maintenance like new glasses and dental care.  Between these two things are they are significantly less than 3k/yr.  If you can't afford health insurance, just self insurance with cash reserve and plan to spend 3K for annual checkup, maintenance, and wellness plans.

8. As for you to be wife, that can be complicated.  For some reason, there is a high case of thyroid cancer for women between the age of 24\-28.   Pap smear is highly recommened from age 21 at lease once every three years.

Cheers,"
HealthInsurance,"I read all of your choices, and I am SO on board with Ambetter Insured By Celtic · Ambetter Balanced Care 4 (2018): IlliniCare Health Network. That is the only plan I would consider and sign up for if I had all of these choices. 

As far as your ETA: While the hospital may be listed on the insurance company as in-network, and healthcare.gov doesn't, you need to consider the fact that every insurance company has many different lines of products, so while they may be in-network with the company, they may not be with the plan YOU have with their company. 

Once you sign up, you'll be given a list of all the local hospitals/ER's and physicians that accept your plan and are in network. Just make sure you go to them. In the case of a true medical emergency, you will still be covered wherever you go (as long as it's a true medical emergency, go to closest hospital) on an emergent case basis. "
HealthInsurance,"So if they were given any of those vaccines, it should be covered regardless of whether it was inpatient or outpatient care, correct?

The customer service agent from my insurance claimed that because it was inpatient care, none of it is covered as preventative.

Edit: Just checked and it was Hepatitis B."
HealthInsurance,"The idea behind pre-existing condition limitations (PCLs) isn’t so much that something isn’t covered but that something might not be covered if you didn’t have continual insurance. It was created to combat opportunists who would only get insurance after finding out they were sick. With PCLs, things can and still eventually will be covetable, but only after a waiting period and only if you didn’t have continual coverage. In the old days, you would leave one insurance, and then maybe 3 weeks later get a new insurance, and you would give the new one an eligibility letter form the old one called a Certificate or Creditable Coverage. It basically confirmed that there wasn’t any unreasonable gap and that PCLs should more or less not apply since you weren’t an opportunist. The key element of PCLs though is that the condition to which the PCL refers _can_ be covered.

All this is to drive at the difference between PCLs and straight up exclusions. In the latter case, it’s not that you had the condition before signing up with the insurance and if only it weren’t true since it could then be covered. It’s simply that it’s not covered period. My plan doesn’t cover a gas station attendant waving crystals over my head. That doesn’t make the migraine Sanjay Rasmalan is treating a pre-existing condition. It’s just simply never covered for anyone at all. That’s not a pre-existing condition limitation. It’s just a limitation. And the ACÁ does allow many limitations"
HealthInsurance,"This also. If there's an injury where another insurance may be liable, the claim will automatically get rejected or suspended. If this was on concrete stairs leading into a building, the property owner's insurance might be liable."
HealthInsurance,"Well yeah, they can't sell them, but if they were on it already then they can stay on. That's kinda the point."
HealthInsurance,"You can view plans at healthcare.gov but unless you have a qualifying life event (loss of coverage, moving, married, etc) you can't switch plans until open enrollment in November. "
HealthInsurance,"Honestly, I couldn't tell you with certainty if it's 3rd party or state. I thought it was state but could be wrong. But yeah, may have to make some changes in the future.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts. "
HealthInsurance,"When I get an Rx for more than a months worth of meds I only get it in 30 day increments, and pay for 30 days worth at a time. I refill it once a month. Doesn't the Rx label say you have refills left? It should. Something isn't adding up here."
HealthInsurance,"Get a Blue plan, don’t bother with United. Too many people have issues with claims. 

Make sure the deductible isn’t too high in case you ever have to pay it! 

Also check for drug copays in case you have regular prescription costs. With a new baby, you might want to check office visit copay costs in case you have a lot of doctor visits!"
HealthInsurance,"Rough estimate including most of the recovery with physical therapy etc.  $80,000 - $100,000.  But with the horrible ACA that specifically prohibits any and all preexisting condition exclusions he will be able to enroll for coverage that will save him tens of thousands of dollars.  Just has to wait for open enrollment in September to get coverage for January 1, 2019.  Until then he has to wait with a bad hip or pay for the whole thing. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; pays benefits *up to a $1,000,000 Policy Lifetime Maximum*

bzzzzt - NOT ACA compliant"
HealthInsurance,Did you contact the issuer to see if they’ll let you pay to get current and reinstate your coverage?
HealthInsurance,"with this plan, nothing, at least the lifeshield that I sold. You would have to wait until ACA enrollment time."

HealthInsurance,"You're correct, but it's my doctors fault that I'm out so much money for what isn't even a full prescription.  I'm just lamenting that they're not going to feel bad and give me that money, because it's their fault that I'm out that cost.  "
HealthInsurance,"While you're on the phone with them you can get details of how the claim was processed, what you should have owed, and ask how many days of supply they billed for both times."
HealthInsurance,"Right. Your 90% coinsurance will kick in really early and you'll only pay 10% of your costs. In catastrophic coverage, you'd be paying everything out of pocket until you hit the max."
HealthInsurance,"My heart feels kind of funny, can you check my BP? I banged my foot into the coffee table, xray please! Etc "
HealthInsurance,"Sounds cheap to the plan we have. $500 to see GYN outside of well care, $350 to establish as a new patient with a PCP... Also, we just went to the ER on Friday and expect that will be in excess of $2,000.  Probably $3,000 due to the time we spent there. "
HealthInsurance,Sure! Anthem BCBS in Virginia.
HealthInsurance,"I signed up for healthcare.gov.. they were easy and a number of affordable plans

Other than that I would look at job opportunities for your wife. "
HealthInsurance,"Agreed on healthcare.gov. The income limit for subsidies is $98,400 for a family of 4 - above that and you pay full price. Be aware that there are a lot of deductions you can take since you’re self-employed to get your healthcare.gov income down. "
HealthInsurance,"Do you have an ER copay? If so, you usually just get charged $250 for visiting without getting admitted."
HealthInsurance,"Regardless of how things used to be, all that should matter is whether or not current records show you have/had coverage on that date of service. If the old coverage has been retroactively terminated, that old insurance is under zero obligation to pay the claim because—duh—your coverage does not extend to that date. The current insurance company needs to be apprised of that. I would avoid the appeal process. It’s typically lengthy and complex and people too often try to use it for issues that can and should be addressed with phone calls. Call them and explain that the other coverage has been ended and they don’t show you as having been active on that date. They may request some sort of letter from the other insurance for proof, but that should be easy for a rep of theirs to send out to you."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, young people never consider how much it costs to get old and sick. Save and invest now, seriously. I had a heart attack without insurance, it cost over $80K. I managed to pay $1K/mo for a couple of years, but I got behind on taxes and had business setbacks, so... Collection agency is relentless, they'll probably be taking me to court soon. I've considered immigrating somewhere with a reasonable medical system, just to survive. There are some pretty good places where your parents could live on their retirement, but they probably won't do it. Old people don't want to deal with that much change, they want to be around the grandkids, etc."
HealthInsurance,"Ah - this week got crazy but a quick update: donut consumed Wednesday after lunch as a reward for having over half my to do list done before noon ���� (&amp; insurance has gone silent but since I have a weekend work trip that needs prep &amp; my full attention, UHC doesn’t get more head space from me till next week ��)"
HealthInsurance,"Agreed though I admit I'm not as familiar with medi-cal as I am with other states. If OP does have zero taxable income then they don't need to worry about the tax penalty. If they are under the filing threshold/not required to file, they won't owe the penalty. That said, a short-term wouldn't have anything to do with that (like you said). That said, OP is committing tax fraud so in the event they were found out and had to pay back taxes, then the penalty would be back in play. OP, if you have $5k/month in taxable income that you're not paying taxes on, then you wouldn't be eligible for medi-cal if you told medi-cal about the $5k/month. If you told them that your monthly income was $5k/month then that would be a lie and, if you were not caught, you should qualify. What should you do?

HealthInsurance,"Some insurance has a set copay for prescriptions that is effective even before you meet your deductible. Generic is cheaper than name brand and it’s often a set amount for each. It sounds like your insurance does not require you to meet your deductible first. I believe this is how all my insurance has been (and I have held a few different jobs over the last decade). I’ve never gone to the pharmacy and had to pay more than like $20 for a 90-day supply of any of my drugs (all generic).

My theory is that your insurance company knows if you stay on your meds your doctor prescribed, you’re less likely to require a super expensive surgery/hospitalization which would end up costing the insurance company way more than your prescriptions. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes! PART D, my mistake. :)

Also, my understanding is that the patient was already Medicaid, so there is/was no reasoning as to why she wouldn't still qualify for Medicaid to be the supplement/secondary to her new Medicare. "
HealthInsurance,"When I went to the doctor a month ago they did ask me while doing my vitals the last time I went to the eye doctor, I didn't think the health insurance would have the 1 year vision screening. I'll have to look into that. 

Would the physicians office be able to give me a prescription that I could take and to an eye doc to pick out frames for? "
HealthInsurance,"When he is hired at the new job he can ask for the brochures on company plans. You will be able to see the price difference (just making up the premium costs here for example) for just your husband 400$/month versus your husband plus spouse 500$/mo or your husband plus family 600$/mo. You will not have to pay the family premium until baby arrives. You may also choose whether you want to add vision and dental insurance if it is offered by the company. There may be different plans to choose from, so keep in mind that one may be less costly per month, however you will have a higher deductible. For example one plan may be 400$/mo for the whole family but the deductible might be $5,000. That means your hospital birth would require that you pay the $5k before your insurance will pick up the rest of the bill. You will also want to check the policies for what they charge for imaging, lab testing, and specialist physician visits. It’s good to know how much things will cost in the event someone is in a car accident, needs surgery or needs to see a dermatologist (just an example). Hope this helps. If I can help with any questions feel free to ask. I will try to answer to best of my knowledge.

Edit: to rephrase for clarity, by “what they charge for testing” I mean what percentage the insurance will cover. For example - for X-ray and CT scan, does the insurance only cover 20%? That could mean hundreds of dollars out of your pocket if you need these tests. "
HealthInsurance,"It could if they didn't drag their feet processing the claim. We have one from the beginning of January and because it is so large they find ways to delay processing. I think that is built into insurance company processes--delay payment as long as possible. Technically it wouldn't matter which claim is which as we pay toward our OOP max, but with the program it does (to us). This is why it feels like a cheat. But we still end up paying a good chunk of our OOP ourselves, not through the program. Last year we hit it in March but this year, well, it's May."
HealthInsurance,What state are you in?
HealthInsurance,Sorry for the delayed reply. I will look into this when the time comes!! Thank you!
HealthInsurance,Thank you much!
HealthInsurance,"Yes you are correct about all those things, I believe only the premium is covered "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for replying!  

I just looked up my benefits and for ""Physician Benefits"" it says that they pay 50%  of the maximum allowance for non-participating providers.  

Is the maximum allowance my individual non-participating provider deductible? Would that mean that I can see an out of network specialist without extra charge until I reach that 50% limit?"
HealthInsurance,"I agree with the common refrain here that while maybe health insurance isn't perfect, it's the incredible cost and opaqueness of pricing in healthcare that is the bigger issue. Pricing transparency along with other incentives to insureds to shop in part based on price would help."
HealthInsurance,"Was the new doctor out of network? 

Was it an annual gyn visit? Those are the only ones that would be covered at 100%. Had you already had an annual this year?"
HealthInsurance,"Interesting! The same thing happened on my plan with humira this year. I'll look into that link. "
HealthInsurance,"Don't call you insurance provider, call covered CA and escalated. Done. "
HealthInsurance,I love you both
HealthInsurance,"Yes you have 90 days to elect cobra. You have to pay all three months, but the effective date is retroactive back to the date coverage ended  "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;any course of action I can take to get coverage during this gap.

Hmmm.  Depending on bills generated by your wife's hospitalization \- I expect they'd be pretty substantial \- COBRA via her former coverage might help.

But given the circumstances I might also politely request wife's employer's insurer for documentation of their coverage termination practice in writing, preferably quoting from some plan document you're entitled to have access to \- like its Summary Plan Description \(SPD\)."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;cheapest thing I can find under $250/month and with a deductible of around $1000? 

you don't do this sort of thing on a regular basis, do you?

there is no such thing.

but regarding the ACA marketplace, are you sure you've confirmed the person you're helping is not eligible for premium credits?

Also, why does she need such a low deductible with household income of $70k? She'll be Medicare eligible within months."
HealthInsurance,Thanks for all the help and information. I’ll DM you the info!
HealthInsurance,You must be American! Isn’t it grand?!
HealthInsurance,"Are those plans subsidized? Subsidy and tax credits are highly individual to each person for location so make sure you're comparing apples to apples. 

But nah, it's going to implode soon. Thanks Republicans"
HealthInsurance,"Our claims gurus will probably soon weigh in with specific thoughts. My general thought is you should be ok; but my longer term recommendation would be, hard as it may be for all of you, to continue to work toward some understanding with your folks."
HealthInsurance,"No, because then people would only buy insurance when they knew they were going to be sick. This causes prices to skyrocket for everyone and would leave a lot of people uninsured who will experience accidents. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Ah, so you have a contract year vs. calendar year policy. That is either due to an employer or when you signed up through the market, assuming one of the two is correct. If it's through an employer, than it's just a learning lesson, now you know the group is on a contract year vs. calendar year. If it's the latter, and you didn't sign up last May, then there's more digging to do, IMO. "
HealthInsurance,"That kind of non-insurance usually gets folks out of the fine, but it's non-ACA compliant, so the 26 rule probably isn't in effect there."
HealthInsurance,"You need to read your explanation of benefits, or EOB. THEY CHANGE EVERY YEAR. I'm telling for a reason"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"So far I haven't seen any bills for the ambulance service, I was referring to the E.R/hospital/surgery/anesthesia/doctor bills, all of which are being billed as out-of-network."
HealthInsurance,"Inpatient stays generally need authorization from the insurance company for payment. Assuming you have out of network coverage, this will be huge in at least getting the insurance to make some kind of payment. If they approve the stay at out of network, you could call the insurance company and they could potentially allow the stay to be at the in network level due to the emergent circumstances. You won’t get the same allowed amounts you would at an in network facility, however they often negotiate a lower allowed. First step, call the insurance company."
HealthInsurance,"I currently have an insurance plan that works almost anywhere in the country, but it's through an employer. Are you saying it's not possible to get this individually? Or just that they don't always extend to all 50 states? I don't need anything that extends to Alaska and Hawaii, but I'd like something similar to the plan I have now!"
HealthInsurance,I only know of one company that will accept a prior companies deductible for the same year. That's the one that I used to work for..
HealthInsurance,"I am a little different. I have an HSA plan available to me, but I did the math, and it won't work. My husband has some fairly expensive medical conditions, so we need the traditional copay type plan. I will tell you this, if it were not from that, we would definitely be on the HSA plan. He's at the plans of the future. It make sure that the actual consumers have skin in the game."
HealthInsurance,"Yes, it is a law. The penalty or how strictly it's enforced I don't know. In the end you pay the full premium so I don't know why they wouldn't. Also make sure they have your correct address. Contact that number for info/complaints. Best of luck!"
HealthInsurance,820/mo
HealthInsurance,"&gt;1.) how screwed am I?

not entirely, but it's going to be a pain in the ass

&gt;2.) will uhc accept claims outside of the 90 day filing period with a timely appeal...

yes, the providers can file a corrected claim with proof of timely filing and they should be accepted.  if not, they can appeal and it should be reconsidered.

&gt;3.)has anybody been through this and it was resolved eventually?

not me personally, but I did work @ Cigna for over 10 years and resolved quite a few issues just like this.  it can be done, but like I said...it will be a pain in the ass.

&gt;5.) how likely are providers going to goto collections before calling me? Some of these services I don't have the numbers for.

Don't expect a refund until both payers have completely adjusted their claims. after that, pay attention to your EOBs, as they will show the final patient liability after the adjustments.  If you paid more than what is considered the new patient liability, then you'll be due a refund.

&gt;5.) how likely are providers going to goto collections before calling me? Some of these services I don't have the numbers for.

If you stay in contact with the provider's billing offices they'll be much more likely to work with you and keep the account open and out of collections.  If you can't get in touch with them, contact the referring provider (aka the Dr that referred your bloodwork to their lab) and they should be able to provide some contact info.

&gt;6.) any advice?

don't give up on fixing it, and don't hesitate to escalate to a supervisor if calling insurance doesn't yield the results you want.  you'll likely be talking to front line employees that don't really have the ability to manage your case through, so it wouldn't hurt to get it in the hands of a supervisor that can help get your issues addressed quickly/thoroughly. 

"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Will I really lose my benefits through my private plan if I opt out of the employer health plan?

Not if your employer abides by the law.

You CAN have marketplace coverage, and  you need not enroll in your employer's plan, but if the cost to you to enroll in your employer's plan is ""affordable"" - under about 10% of your earnings - you won't qualify for ACA premium credits for your marketplace coverage option. This MAY shuffle your comparison of marketplace vs employer coverage. Have you taken this circumstance into account?"
HealthInsurance,"I really don't know, that's just it. When we were approached with the issues by the office manager she was concerned and wanted my daughter back ASAP. The child development clinic she went to wanted her in occupational and physical therapy. The therapist's office had these orders. I'm not sure what to do next though."
HealthInsurance,"Awesome, thank you! I was nervous about the penalty, too, so good to know that I'll be fine if its just one month without coverage.

"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! "
HealthInsurance,"Can't help too much here, but yes, you can get Obamacare as a family if you apply in the next 60 days. 

The good news is Obamacare for babies will be retroactive to the date of birth. The bad news is it wouldn't be retroactive for your wife and won't cover you two until the 1st of June (assuming you sign up by the 15th of this month)"
HealthInsurance,"[Here's a walkthru of a COBRA bridge strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) which may help you plan for your situation. It may help you 'solve' for #s 2\-4. 

You may want to be sure any mailing of your COBRA eligiblity notice follows you on your travels, if they're beginning right at month end.

You may buy ACA coverage for a single month. Depending on the timing of your receipt of your COBRA notice, you may not need to buy anything until your need coverage in August."
HealthInsurance,"No, not unless you have another qualifying event.  Otherwise you will need to wait for the open enrollment period.  You will need to pay the penalty only from the months you were not insured--definitely check to see if you can get an exemption--this is income based.

Enrollment periods are to prevent people who don't have insurance getting hurt and then quick enrolling in insurance so they can get coverage. "
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,It won't matter.
HealthInsurance,"I concur. Trying to get providers credentialed (on the other side) is also awful. "
HealthInsurance,They could investigate something like [this](https://www.libertyhealthshare.org/). I'm looking at moving this was myself.
HealthInsurance,"I would simply refer you to healthcare.gov and research all the benefits of the plans that they recommend for you and go from there. I'm not sure if they allow you to preview plans before open enrollment, but I would be surprised if they didn't. This allows you plenty of time to due thorough research and your due diligence and find the best plan for you before you enroll. 

Another alternative is to actually find a local insurance broker who can walk you through the steps, and help you find the best insurance policy for you. I think brokers are great for people who are kind of clueless when it comes to insurance companies and can't (or don't want to) learn about it on your own. However, I also know that while Brokers are free to you, the client, they do get paid by the policies they sell, so take that into consideration. GL!"
HealthInsurance,"Have you filed an appeal? "
HealthInsurance,"Depending on where you are many places have public health clinics that offer low cost services. Have you Googled such things in your area? "
HealthInsurance,"Is that a definite qualifying event? Or is it different per company/benefits? "
HealthInsurance,"Nope!

She talked to them today and they also said there was a ""glitch"" in their system that made it look like she was still a member while payments were not actually being taken from her account. Thanks for pointing out the 30 day rule, I just googled Georgia code and here it is apparently 45 days even. So if it's their fault because of  this ""glitch"" and they still refuse to pay, is there anything we can do short of legal action...?"
HealthInsurance,Medicare for all is not the Panacea that you think it is.
HealthInsurance,"I'm 29. Nothing is grouped into the plan - I pay vision, life, and dental separately. "
HealthInsurance,That is depressing but it makes sense and I guess it's pretty obvious. Thanks
HealthInsurance,"It would be considered health insurance, so go to urgent care would be fine. "
HealthInsurance,"Did you read through your explanation of benefits? There should be a row regarding pharmacy/prescriptions and whether the deductible applies or does not. My kids and husband have a high deductible plan, but wellness visits, minute clinics, online care and prescriptions do not apply to the deductible and are copay only (not co-insurance). "
HealthInsurance,"The best you can do is find a catastrophic insurance plan that will cover you in the event of major diagnosis, otherwise, you're just going to be stuck paying cash for anything that you might need until open enrollment is open again. Search for local health clinics in your area, or even the clinics in pharmacies such as Walgreens or CVS for cheap alternate clinic visits, if needed. "
HealthInsurance,"Geez!  Thanks for the reply.  So what the heck is one to do?  Basically, if you plan on retiring early then you need to make sure you save enough to cover health insurance \(24k a year!\)?"
HealthInsurance,Sorry for the delayed reply.  Thanks for the link and the suggestion.  That should prove to be very helpful.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;is she under a long\-term claim for her current carrier?

what does this mean?"
HealthInsurance,"Update:  Your comments gave me better vocab and understanding to dig deeper.  She is on Medicare and BCBS is the medicare advantage provider.  

It is possible Avonex was only denied because I give her the shot at home!  If she goes to her doctor to get it administered, I may be able to get Medicare to pay.  I'll make some calls tomorrow.

Thanks for the incredibly fast responses!"
HealthInsurance,Turning 26 is a qualifying life event. Make sure she notifies HR prior to turning of age so that there is no lapse in coverage. This happened to me about a year ago. It should be a pretty smooth transition as long as she keeps everyone in the loop.
HealthInsurance,"thanks, that's helpful  :-)"
HealthInsurance,"But it might be something along those lines, it is on the controlled substance list. They're labeled Amphetamine Salts, it's an adderall XR generic. "
HealthInsurance,"Exactly, no reason to have such a low deductible at this point.  "
HealthInsurance,"OK, first of all, I think (from what you wrote and how I'm interpreting it) that you're being a little bit WebMD neurotic right now. 

If there is no official diagnosis or even any testing for cancer, then it would not apply at pre-exsisting. However, you would want to verify that with an insurance broker would could help you find the short term health insurance, because if you go to the doctor and he/she documents ""symptoms of over 3 months, we did tests, tests confirmed cancer"" then the insurance company could balk at paying the claims, although it would be worth a fight with them to overturn the denials. 

I would strongly suggest applying for Medicaid (which is the local government plan your family is on, unless I'm mistaken), to at least find out if you qualify. Lines of credit available does not count as assets. Only the cash in your pocket or checking accounts, or homes/cars, etc. 

Also, I have to say this, if you feel that strongly about blood clot, then you will be dead in a matter of days if you don't get it taken care of it. I went one week with what I KNEW was a blood clot in my leg (I've been in healthcare field for 20+ years, I knew what it was, I was just hoping it would go away on it's own. Spoiler Alert: They don't.) I went in a Friday night to ER, even though I had an appointment on Monday AM with my PCP, and I was told quite firmly that I would have been dead if I had waited. Blood clots spread rapidly through the blood stream and can go into your lungs, and worst case scenario, your brain. 

So, try not to be an alarmist, try not to diagnosis yourself over the internet and simply do your best to get insurance and go see a physician for a check up. 

If you have enough pain and other symptoms going on (you didn't go into details) then go to your nearest ER. They cannot turn you away for medically needed emergency care, however once you do that, you would be officially diagnosed which may cause problems with finding a short term insurance that has pre-exisiting conditions on it. 

Another option is Catastrophic insurance, which would then cover you if you are given a catastrophic diagnosis code. 

Insurance usually begins the first day of the month after you join, or possibly even on the 15th of the month, if you were to buy it this week. Find a broker in your area. Use Google and find an actual broker that has an office in your area, make an appointment and go see him/her. They'll be able to give you all of your options. Try to keep your fears and convictions that you have cancer to yourself, but explain it more like, ""What if I go to the doctor next week and they run tests and it's cancer? Would that be covered?"" rather than ""I'm pretty sure I have cancer, yep, I have cancer, what insurance plan can I jump on to get it covered?"" NO, don't do that!

OK, long diatribe over, GL. "
HealthInsurance,"Ahh, I figured it was something like this. I wish they could come out and do tests / physical exam to see if someone's really in good health, to decide whether to take on the risk. Like I want to give you money, but you'll only take it during certain times of year? Nuts!"
HealthInsurance,Where do i even start??
HealthInsurance,"As with so many things, this issue could be solved with a time machine lol."
HealthInsurance,"You can appeal within the system first (and should). In general you can appeal, appeal a denied appeal, and a third appeal can escalate to an outside review board. So be sure to keep any documentation about a glitch or any other findings that come up along the way. "
HealthInsurance,"I would still keep her in her parents plan until 26. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; but their hospital bill ended up being something like 8000 dollars

That's generous haha. I had a 30min outpatient laparoscopy that ended up around ~14,000 which was the negotiated rate even. But yep. We've strayed so far in public understanding that insurance is for unexpected medical expenses primarily, not routine. "
HealthInsurance,yeah..  you do not need to be paying that much if you are healthy. Don't worry ! Go ahead and change when you get the opportunity.
HealthInsurance,Does this include stuff prescribed by a dermatologist? That's what my prescription was for.
HealthInsurance,"Check into student insurance at the school you will/are attending. "
HealthInsurance,"This depends on the state and the plan. Different rules and regulations for the various states and ACA plans. "
HealthInsurance,"Hey, artnos, just a quick heads-up:  
**should of** is actually spelled **should have**. You can remember it by **should have sounds like should of, but it just isn't right**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
HealthInsurance,Thank you very much!!
HealthInsurance,"Did a generic just come out for that prescription? The insurance company will reclass the brand-name drug as non-preferred in that case.  There could also be a competitor drug that they switched the preferred designation to, also.  In the first case your pharmacy should have notified you and given you the option to get the generic (or switched automatically if the doc didn't write the prescription ""Dispense as Written"".  Either way you'll end up talking to the insurance in the morning to find out what changed and what alternatives they have preferred coverage for, and if you can appeal if you've already tried their alternative."
HealthInsurance,"Could you clarify what a lapse in coverage would entail? For most of 2017 I didn’t have any insurance but starting in 2018 I did have it up until the end of April which is when I left my company. I won’t be able to enroll in my new insurance plan until June. Previously before 2017, I do believe I had some sort of insurance plan."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the info! Seems unlikely to be the case though, I am already taking a generic. "
HealthInsurance,"Legally your information shouldn't be available to your parents under the HIPAA privacy laws HOWEVER, there honestly isn't a guarantee that they wouldn't be notified by 'mistake'. Some major insurance companies don't give the policy holder access to adult dependent's information on their websites, some do. It's also possible that information gets sent to the wrong address. Personally, I had medical statements that somehow ended up being sent to my EX! That was an 'error' by the doctors office! 

Another proactive step you could take in addition to the registering online &amp; electronic EOB set\-up would be to call the insurance &amp; ask them what their policy is. You could also ask them to set up a password that has to be verified before any of your information is disclosed to a caller. I hope that helps you! "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;   am really nervous that the marketplace will not approve me either. I have an autoimmune disease and need to maintain the medication I currently have.

The marketplace will cover you.  The questions about household income are designed to determine if you will receive any financial subsidies to help you with your premiums.  If the family income is above a certain level then the answer might be ""no"" but you will still be able to purchase insurance by paying the full premium.

A few years ago some of the insurance companies in my area offered ""off exchange"" individual policies that you could get directly from them.  I did that for one year because the network offered was better than any of the exchange plans.  But for the last two years there has only been one company in our area that sells insurance to individuals and that is limited to a few similar plans through the exchange.  You can apply for the same plans directly with them but I'm not sure if they involve the exchange or not if you aren't interested in any subsidies."
HealthInsurance,"You will actually have two options. 

The first option is staying on the Marketplace. On your application you will need to estimate you will earn above $16,643 this year to be directed to a Marketplace plan with some government subsidies. Marketplace eligibility is based on estimated yearly income. 

However, Medicaid is based on current monthly income. If you earn less than $1,355 a month, you can get Medicaid. That probably makes the most sense for you when you get there, since it is cheaper. If your income rises enough you eventually don’t qualify anymore, you can switch back to the Marketplace. You could apply via a Marketplace application, but it’s usually processed faster if you apply directly through Medicaid. "
HealthInsurance,"I wouldn’t say that “health insurance sucks”. I would say that most people don’t understand how it works and don’t even try to figure it out. Most people do more research on buying a car, then they do on their health insurance premiums. 

With that said, if you are asking how to make costs come down in the US, we could start by talking about the amount of waste that’s in the system. 33% of all dollars spent on healthcare in this country is wasted spend from over testing, duplicate billing, fraud/abuse, etc. More risk needs to be placed on hospitals and doctors to make sure that they are managing their patients effectively. Imagine if you were a contractor building a house and responsible for ordering the materials and always ordered 33% more than you needed and still got paid, but the house was never finished. Same thing in healthcare. Doctors are allowed to basically order anything they want and still expect to get paid, even if the patients do not get better. If the insurance comp denies the claim, they just go after the member for payment and the member thinks their insurance sucks, and then the doctor just blames the insurance company. "
HealthInsurance,"If you find out your term date on the old insurance, you'll have to get that information to your new insurance company's COB dept. If they know the old insurance wasn't effective on the date of service then they should be able to reprocess the claim."
HealthInsurance,"I am in Michigan
"
HealthInsurance,"No. The allowance is the amount that your benefits apply to. So if you have say, a $500 out of network deductible, and you go to an out of network specialist, the bill might be $200, but if the allowance is only $100, only the allowance goes toward your deductible (sorry about the run on sentence...). You would still pay the full $200, though. 

In that same example if your deductible is met, your plan will pay $50, since that is half of the allowance, and you will pay the other $150.

The tricky part is that you generally won't know the allowance until the claim is processed."
HealthInsurance,"Glad you're good, don't worry, we're here to help if anything goes wrong."
HealthInsurance,"I only know the information that I was able to get out of the insurer/hospital - billing code is the same, provider is the same, very similar office visits. "
HealthInsurance,"GoodRx is what I use for my prescriptions my plan doesn't cover my Adderall, so I have to pay for it out of pocket."
HealthInsurance,"I'd say that is unusual.  The ""allowed amount"" (negotiated rate) should be constant for the same procedure, regardless of who is actually paying.  Contact your insurance company or check their website for the explanation of benefits for both claims and see how they have explained this."
HealthInsurance,"Your EOB should clear up confusion. Also I would recommend calling BCBS and asking someone to walk you through this. 

Without seeing your plan design it's hard to give you a solid opinion.

HealthInsurance,Echoing the explanation of benefits. You need to make sure your insurance got the claim and processed on it.
HealthInsurance,"If you have a suitcase on the bottom corner of your insurance card, I’ve figured out you can use it anywhere with BCBS"
HealthInsurance,"Also check into EPIC. Depends on age for eligibility.  AND  go to the pharmaceutical manufacturer and see if they offer any ""offers or grants"" for medications.  Check goodrx as well.  Good Luck!  Please keep us posted.  "
HealthInsurance,"Many, if not most, health systems in ""first world countries"" are not, actually, ""single payer systems"". 

Single payer is about as narrowly defined a term as ""all natural""."
HealthInsurance,"Healthcare is expensive in the United States.  While insurance isn't cheap if you take a trip to the ER having insurance is very helpful.  Unlike many other developed countries, the United States does not have universal healthcare and there is no government caps on what healthcare can cost (including prescription drugs)."

HealthInsurance,"You still qualify for federal help. Go to MNsure.org. It's the official website for Minnesota for people like you who need insurance. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;seems like all of those require a qualifying life event still?

no, but they can &amp; do refuse to write policies based on presence of some health conditions, impose pre\-existing condition restrictions, have waiting periods for benefits eligibility for some conditions, and often cap benefits for treatment of the most serious/costly sorts of illness/injury. 

Other than that, they're pretty great plans!

&gt;I'm in Texas.

Ugh. Not the best place to need coverage, or care"
HealthInsurance,"and now I need to modify the court order to say that in future when i leave employer I can obtain health insurance privately, exchange or via employr.

right now though employer  has to obied by the court order when at the time I was employed by Employer A I also need to get coverage from Employer B.

So Messed up.

I will need to cancel Kids current health insurance that I was paying $228 for them ONLY

my employer will charge me $700 for me AND THE KIDS. I just want the kids covered cause I have my own otuside of work!"
HealthInsurance,"I know short term plans exist but I’m not as familiar with them. I know a lot (if not all?) of them are not subject to ACA standards, so they’re allowed to do things like deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. 
For Medicaid they will go off the last 30 days of income. So it may depend on when she quits as well. If you apply online there’s usually a space to add notes, and you could put a note in stating that projected income is $0 due to no longer being employed. I recommend trying to get mail sent to your new residence as soon as possible because they can be used as proof of residency (utility bills, USPS mail forwarding, lease/mortgage receipt, etc). Apply as soon as possible because they have up to 45 days to process the application. 
Hope that helps!"
HealthInsurance,"Somethings require the deductible somethings don't.

My coverage covers primary care doctor/specialist visits without meeting the deductible. 

If god forbid, there was a larger problem  you would hit the deductible while paying the 20% co-insurance until you hit your max out of pocket.

HealthInsurance,"Ask the Aetna how you flag something for urgent appeal. They should have a process. "
HealthInsurance,"It was just something that a friend on Facebook commented and said to watch out for. Even she wasn't sure though, so I definitely can't say it's true. "
HealthInsurance,Definite. [https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying\-life\-event/](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/)
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the advice! I actually just got off the phone with Blue Cross Blue Shield, I asked them about it and they said our policy does have dental coverage for routine care, and that they should be receiving the claim from the dentist, since MetLife is a supplemental policy. Unfortunately, his advice was basically to just have them resend it. He did say that it’s possible they have the wrong member id when submitting, so hopefully that’s what’s causing my issue, otherwise it looks like I’ll be calling them again."
HealthInsurance,"This is also a situation where you could go to your local planned parenthood, avoiding all issues involved with insurance. "
HealthInsurance,"I should have mentioned in my post that my insurance premiums are the same no matter how many dependents are on my policy.   

I'm not sure if that changes the outcome of all this or not. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you so much! :) "
HealthInsurance,"Do you have an integrated medical and pharmacy deductible?

Do you mind posting the med and what the exact label is on the prescription you picked up?

Is this a new employer/insurance carrier/prescription for you? Or had you paid $120 the month before, all other things the same, and now it’s less."
HealthInsurance,"Have you checked into travel insurance? I'm not sure if they offer plans long term, such as 9 months, but I know that we've accepted travel insurance from other countries outside the USA from patients who are here over half a year. "
HealthInsurance,Maybe he's sick now and wants to be covered.
HealthInsurance,"This is why we need to close the ""family loophole"" - this right here. The regulation wasn't really written with the idea that employers would calculate and charge employees 9.689 % of income for self only coverage, but the unfortunate fact remains that it's completely legal to do so."
HealthInsurance," you should call the urgent care and ask if they require payment up front or of they will bill you after the claim is processed. Also if you need to pay up front you can pay out of pocket and reimburse yourself from the savings account. Keep the receipt!"
HealthInsurance,What's your estimated income?
HealthInsurance,"Triage = care/visit

Other people in the thread are right $100 is lucky af"
HealthInsurance,If it never actually took effect it won't count as a qualifying life event. You aren't going to be able to get Affordable Care Act compliant coverage until open enrollment (this should be in November for coverage starting January 2019) unless you get a job that offers it.
HealthInsurance,"If you go to an in network provider, the insurance will lower the billed to the contracted rate, or your $300. This is then what you would pay until your deductible is met. "
HealthInsurance,"I have had an HSA for two years. I used it for urgent care and a few specialist visits last year. I drained the account this year due to fulfill my deductible. I posted about it here, which has detail about my experience.

https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/7vnjhx/high_deductible_billing_question_hsa_balances/

I'm still waiting for the deposit by the way. I've had to pay out of pocket for dental procedures as the HSA is drained. When it rains, it pours (poors? heh). 

Per the recommendation, I have started telling providers I will not pay in advance. They tell me to go to another provider then. They will not accept partial payment."
HealthInsurance,Well if you have to ask this question..........
HealthInsurance,"I am assuming they have a tax credit. The 3 month grace period is not a rolling grace period, meaning if they paid after April was dhe then they are still in the 3 month grace period starting when they originally brcame delinquent. They need to completely catch up everything that is due to get out of the grace period and start over."
HealthInsurance,Yep. Use any HSA funds to pay that bill and your pharmacy costs. Make sure there is an insurance discount or adjustment made to billed charges (see either the provider invoice or your carrier explanation of benefits (EOB)) to be sure the correct amount was billed to you. That’s about what I pay at a primary for a non-wellness event.
HealthInsurance,"Unfortunately it's difficult to recommend anything since it's entirely dependent on what plan(s) are offered in your immediate area. For example, in my case there are only 2 plans, a Kaiser HMO and a narrow network PPO. While I do have a choice of deductibles (bronze, silver, gold, HDHP, etc) the basics of who is in each companies plan and what is covered are mostly the same.

Based on what you have said I would look to see what plans include your wifes Dr or medical team as ""in network"" and base the decision on that. The rest is simply what you are comfortable paying on a monthly basis and deductible wise. "
HealthInsurance,"Is the issue that you have to pay a co-pay each time you get a prescription, so you're paying the co-pay every 30 days instead of every 90 days? If not that, I'm not understanding the issue, prescriptions don't normally give volume pricing, I don't think. "
HealthInsurance,Coverage in terms of network? Is there any way to actually find that out? Comparing the two plans in terms of what they cover it seems like the cheaper plan covers the same things and at a lower out of pocket cost
HealthInsurance,"Don’t go without insurance from May - October. Once you turn 26, you have a qualifying event if you fall off your parents policy to get a plan outside of open enrollment. You have 60 days from the date of your qualifying event to apply for coverage. To avoid the tax penalty typically one must have 10 months of essential coverage throughout the year. Contact healthcare.gov, 18003182596! :) good luck!"
HealthInsurance,"I was under the impression it would be simple too... 20 phone calls later though lol. Honestly, the lack help resolving the issue through Illinicare has been laughable. Fortunately, the nice ladies at CVS pharmacy, who I spoke with today, were very helpful and I think have got me pointed in the right direction. It's seems that Illinicare thinks I have Caremark insurance, which hasn't been the case for 2 years. They were nice enough (the ladies at CVS) to give me a print out that I should be able to send to Illinicare as proof I no longer have Caremark as insurance. Honestly, could of got this resolved sooner if Illinicare would have told me what the conflicting insurance company was, but they always told me they didn't know and would send me on a wild goose chase. "
HealthInsurance,take the penalty.

HealthInsurance,I'm curious to know if you've tried medical marijuana?
HealthInsurance,"Call the old company, they will give you an end date for that policy."
HealthInsurance,"Hey Y'all. I filed an out-of-network mental health (psychotherapy) claim with my insurance after paying $165 out of pocket to the provider. This is what my claim looks like and it seems to me that they denied the claim, or they covered some of it ($69 out of $165) saying that the rest was too expensive? I'm on United Healthcare PPO in California. Thanks!"
HealthInsurance,"COBRA isn’t based on your income. It’s 102% of the premium for your previous health plan. You keep the exact same coverage but you have to pay the full premium. Your former employer no longer contributes. 

Your COBRA paperwork should say how much the premium is. That won’t change until you drop COBRA (or if you don’t want it, just ignore the letter). The letter should also tell you when you need to decide by. I think it’s within 2 months of receiving the letter. 

Losing your coverage and going past your COBRA deadline is a qualifying life event in terms of getting on the marketplace, but since your new job has benefits I don’t think you will be eligible since your new employer offers insurance. That one I’m not sure on, but someone here should know for sure. 

Unfortunately you might be stuck paying the $187 premium biweekly or paying the penalty. If you’re healthy and don’t have pre-existing conditions you could probably get by with just catastrophic insurance. Much cheaper than your work’s insurance. 

Did you already enroll at the new employer though? If you did, you can’t make changes until the next open enrollment unless you have a qualifying life event. "
HealthInsurance,"I completely agree, I was astonished when I first found out, it is actually very sad and we would love patients that didn't have insurance, and just bill them a flat 5K for the entire services (not counting hospital, remember, that's a whole different bill and charges, this is JUST for the actual OB/GYN) and put them on payment plans for the 9 months. This was prior to ACA, so we had a lot of un-insured patients that loved our cash rate price as compared to other OB/GYN's who would charge the full insurance price regardless of insurance."
HealthInsurance,I would be amazed if they were willing to do that unless you re-enrolled with a May 1st effective date and it's almost certainly too late to do that (and you wouldn't be covered for April).
HealthInsurance,Good luck!!
HealthInsurance,"Loss of eligibility is a qualifying event, so you should be able to enroll on your employer's plan when you turn 26."
HealthInsurance,"Your best option is to have her stay on her parents insurance until she is 26. This way you don’t have to pay the cost of the extra premium that you would have to pay to join your plans and her deductibles/Out of pockets won’t reset until she joins your plan at 26. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! I get off the phone with them - or today, just disconnected - and feel like such pathetic trash, and it honestly helps to feel heard.

I needed to rant today bc I get so frustrated sometimes - and then after I rant I feel guilty. I’m lucky - I have time to put into this, or at least it only comes out of my life but there’s no boss breathing directly down my neck. Plus I have some healthcare to begin with and of all the challenges I could have OCD actually helps me keep all the paperwork straight. If it drives me this insane, I truly don’t know how people with more limited time and money or bigger challenges even begin to navigate the system... 

Normally I take chocolate breaks but since my job involved covering the campaign, my stress eating got waaaay out of control so I’m trying to reel that back in... But I did buy a Bavarian cream donut when I picked up my car from the repair shop... it’s sitting on my desk... watching me... I’m debating if I’ll call UHC back today or tomorrow; if I call tonight I suspect that the donut will win..."
HealthInsurance,"Monthly, actually!"
HealthInsurance,"You totally could before the ACA went into effect. Of course it wasn't as easy as going online and being covered, you were underwritten and it could take little time if they wanted blood work. And pre-existing conditions might be excluded, depending on what it was and what the insurance company's policy was. But you could buy it anytime, and there was usually a ton of choices to fit every budget.

Hard to say which system was worse. People with medical conditions might think ACA is better, healthy people probably think it's worse.

"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. I do not have proof that I mailed it, but when I saw the letter saying my coverage had been terminated I sent another check for the 4th and 5th months' balances. I'll do as you suggested. "
HealthInsurance,"AA is 100% free all of the time, and most rehabs use the 12 Step model anyway. 

Typically rehab is only a bandaid on a gaping wound, it can be helpful but it won’t cure you of drinking.

You should watch the latest John Oliver episode about rehabs and the racket they are—-most states require zero oversight of them and many states let literally anyone open them. 

It’s mostly a cash racket, they care about your money not getting you sober——that’s why AA works and has the highest success rate, because the people there actually give a shit about themselves and other members getting sober.

Regardless, good luck."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. What would happen in the event of let’s say appendicitis? Would something like that be covered? If you know off hand "
HealthInsurance,"You can apply directly to a company that sells ACA compliant plans outside the market place. You will have to pay the full cost yourself and I'm unsure how the preexisting condition clause works if you've not had continual coverage, maybe you are out of luck there. Talk to a health insurance broker in your area to see what your options are. Unfortunately the ACA made things location dependent so most answers you get will be general and not specific."
HealthInsurance,price transparency will help. A little. much less than appears to be imagined here.
HealthInsurance,"I haven’t used it and have no experience with Cigna. I do work for a large insurer in a department that works closely care management though. 

I’m not sure what there is to be worried about. They likely have access to more information regarding your treatment then you are aware of. The main goals of their program likely are improving outcomes and reducing adverse events. 

If you have questions, you should ask them. "
HealthInsurance,"That’s typically only if it can be shown there wasn’t a choice in the provider selection, though. You got stuck with whatever anesthesiologist was on call and they happened to be OON? We’ll see what we can do. You _chose_ to see an OON psychiatrist? Then that balance billing is a consequence you chose as well."
HealthInsurance,"Tried doing that, they didn't know shit either."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I've had the flu for almost 2 weeks and had to pay out off pocket. Do I have any recourse?

your pre\-insurance\-benefits bills  for your flu treatments are unlikely to exceed your COBRA premiums plus your out\-of\-pocket share of those bills. here's a [walkthru of a COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) that may help you evaluate your coverage choices

&gt;Do I need to elect to take COBRA to be compliant with the tax regulations?

No. Electing COBRA coverage is not likely to be the most economical way for you to avoid the ACA penalty, either."
HealthInsurance,"Sure—-single payer system like every other first world country.... it’s not complicated. "
HealthInsurance,"Your inpatient claim likely is t paid at the line level so the individual services performed would not have an impact on your bill. There may be “charges” for those services but it is generally bundled together at a DRG. "
HealthInsurance,"Oh my. Thanks for the suggestions! I just looked into short\-term insurance, but atleast on the site I read, it says that's not available in NJ. She is in great health, no pre\-existing. I'm further panicked now as it seems even for private insurance there are enrollment windows which we're not in. This is nuts, it's like there's no way to buy insurance!"
HealthInsurance,"I hear you! I HATE credentialing, but I'll do it...for a hefty price. Most providers are happy to pay it just to not have to do it themselves, LOL."
HealthInsurance,"Tough spot. This is where most people who get insurance through their employer realize the true cost of insurance rather than seeing their share of the premium.

Very (very) little experience in the California market, but IMO $700/mo for a $400 deductible plan, assuming it’s a field straightforward PPO, seems like a decent deal. To speak more specifically, we’d need to see the benefits of the plan offerings.

Question to community - when going on COBRA, doesn’t one have to continue the coverage he/she was on when employee is terminated from coverage? I.e. employer offers two plans. When my employment terminated, I am on Plan A. Is my only COBRA option to continue on Plan A rather than switching to Plan B (regardless of reason - coverage, cost)?"
HealthInsurance,Congratulations. You just invented Kaiser Permanente. As well as Henry Ford Health System. Geisinger Health Plan. And a lot of other ones.
HealthInsurance,"Who's your insurance carrier?  Also, is she under a long-term claim for her current carrier?  "
HealthInsurance,"As long as you're in network, you should be fine. 

Consult your plan documents, but in general that's how it works. An HMO plan is where you have to officially change your GP, etc. "
HealthInsurance,"I think that was me who actually told you to check into whether they were ACA compliant or not. I should have been clearer, or perhaps your original post was clear, or perhaps I was just having a bad day with a wrong answer. If you have a claim denied for being pre-exsisting, then that would be fightable, if you have a claim being denied for not being a covered benefit, then that is valid and unfortunately, how it is. "
HealthInsurance,"If you are dancing the edge of Medicaid eligibility, you should qualify for a subsidy on the exchange. "
HealthInsurance,"Gotcha, yeah unfortunately insurance companies aren't in the business of customer service lol
"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the advice. I'm going to see what my next two paychecks look like and hopefully I'll be back under. If I'm not, I'll try and get the Marketplace insurance. I have a pretty good idea of what my income should be, and I'll just go on the higher end of it just in case."
HealthInsurance,"AFTER you get your wife &amp; baby home and everyone is chill, call HR and demand to talk to a manager.  Exceptions can be made - but it requires effort on their part and people often don't want to work."
HealthInsurance,Your advice is *extremely* out of date.
HealthInsurance,"If it does not cover pre-existing conditions then it is likely to do me no good for something like cancer. IIRC, they consider any disease like this to be pre-existing. How will it help me if that is the case? I guess it might at least cover the tests to find it but not the treatment for it?

It really seems that I must delay treatment....or just end up going broke and filing bankruptcy. I worked all my life and had insurance, it's really a shame that this illness hit while I was down and out."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;until recently after COBRA and any sort of open enrollment or special enrollment had closed

Are you sure you received a notice of your COBRA rights? Your election opportunity ""clock"" does not start until you \*receive\* notice. It does NOT start when the event happens. So, if you have not received notice, you'd still have that option.

Short term coverage doesn't help you with penalties for not having health insurance, and the policies have waiting periods &amp; coverage exclusions that may make getting a policy, or accessing coverage under  a policy, difficult for you."
HealthInsurance,"It actually sounds like the claim is being submitted to the wrong company. BCBS typically only handles dental for accidental injury to sound and natural teeth or routine for minors. 

If your dental ins was specifically thru MetLife, get the claim submitted to them instead. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you I appreciate the help.
"
HealthInsurance,"No, I've heard of people putting money into a  401K or something similar that I can't remember the name of. It is entirely legal and common, but it somehow causes them to count your income as less. I say hiding because I don't really know the correct name for it. I've never had to deal with anything like this in my life before. 

I'm can't remember if it was a 401K or something else. "
HealthInsurance,Thank you so much ❤️
HealthInsurance,"&gt;choose the HSA and pocket/invest the difference

Most years most people are mostly as healthy as they mostly are likely to be. Based on your account you've no current need for regular treatment of any chronic condition; you're not routinely taking any pricey medications. You need protection from the financial wallop of steep unanticipatible health treatment bills.  Why would you commit to sending an insurer $4,800 over a year on the off\-chance you need to see a doctor during that time?

Keep your money in your pocket and/or in a triple\-tax\-favored Health Savings Account \(technically, your insurance is a High Deductible Health Plan; deposits to an HSA are optional\)."
HealthInsurance,"Is there an easy way to find this out? I know I don’t get penalized for not having health insurance on my taxes if that means anything? "
HealthInsurance,The BCBS PPO plans can generally be used out of state but it’s always best to double check with with BCBS of Illinois by calling the number on the back of your card.
HealthInsurance,"Do you have specialists that you prefer, currently in network with your employer that would become out of network with an individual plan?

You mentioned you're relatively healthy, I'd keep in mind if there are any conditions that may require seeing a specialist."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, it's due to being eligible for Medicaid.  It could be worthwhile to see if any of the other Medicaid managed care plans (there are now 5 downstate, and I believe 7 in the Chicago area) offer better coverage.  When your managed care open enrollment comes around then you could switch.  "
HealthInsurance,"Some things... Like food or shelter? 

As far as the rules, I've just always had health Care until now. There was no need for me to know about them. It was a matter of shit circumstances and ignorance but it still sucks that this is the system we are stuck with. I get your side but i feel that when it comes to something like your fucking health and well-being that we shouldn't have small windows or else we end up fucked."
HealthInsurance,"better is in the eye of the beholder. 

if ""better"" for you is ""lower monthly premium for comprable coverage, or skinnier coverage if it keeps my premium low"", you'll want ACA coverage.

if ""better"" is ""really generous coverage because I need to have a surgical procedure that will cost me more than the price of a luxury car for the operation and recuperative care"", continuing your employer's coverage might be your best bet.

Better depend on you, and your circumstances."
HealthInsurance,"Did they cash the checks? If they did, get an image of the checks from your bank. Call and ask for the finance dept for your insurance and have them track down your payments. They'll most likely have you fax in proof that your checks were cashed. If your checks were cashed, they'll be somewhere in their system. Once they locate the payments and apply it to the proper account they *should* reinstate coverage for those months."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,I believe this is called balance billing.  And they basically just hope you pay it.  I think they eventually write it off.  Google balance billing.  It's insane how confusing it is.
HealthInsurance,"None, pretty much, unless his income qualifies him for special enrollment options via Medicare and/or Medicaid.

Oh, and that ""gap"" coverage wouldn't cover  his meds anyway \- that is if it was really gap coverage, aka Medicare supplement coverage.  If he had a standalone Part D plan \(covering Rx only\) or a Medicare Advantage policy that included Rx, then yeah, Rx may have been covered.

Any chance dad is a veteran &amp; maybe entitled to some level of VA care?"
HealthInsurance,"That is an extremely dangerous gamble to take for the next two years. It could literally destroy and wipe out their life savings and retirement fund if anything were to happen, and let's face it, they're not 19-21 years old, they are 63, this is when they need health insurance the most. I would strongly advise my parents against taking this risk of not having insurance for two years. 

However, because they are both in good health and don't take any medications, IF anything, at least maybe, possibly move down to just a catastrophic plan. "
HealthInsurance,Report both. NJ medicaid wont care that you are going out of state and may even pick up your copay/deductible from your primary
HealthInsurance,Start by calling the Humira program rep and asking for help. Ours was very helpful.
HealthInsurance,"I've given this a lot of thought. It is not a cheat at all. I don't know an economist so I'm not commenting on that. But this payment assistance program, or coupon program as you call it, is intended to help defer MY cost, not the insurance company's cost.

Let's say a medication costs $6k and the program covers all but $5 of it. Last year, that full $6k went to my out of pocket. This year, the pharmacy benefit management (3rd party) company and/or my insurance only gave credit to my OOP for $5 ""because that was my actual OOP expense."" That meant that $5,995 still came out of my pocket for other medical expenses. But where did the $5,995 that the **assistance program** actually paid really go? It had to go somewhere, and it went to the bottom line of the insurance company. That was $5,995 they didn't have to pay. I'M the one who obtained the help from the **assistance program**, why would the insurance company get the benefit of that? Any cost savings is stolen from me--a cost I likely would not have had without that medication, even over a whole year. Before this medication was needed we never met our OOP max, ever.

Now replace **assistance program** above with **rich uncle** - how would it still be legal?"
HealthInsurance,"Your state may differ but in my state single mothers qualify for CHIP, it may be to your advantage to contact their local office and ask about applying as legally single. 

I wouldn't recommend uprooting your entire lives to go to Europe, but hey to each their own. 

Why is his Insurance dropping at 21? ACA compliant plans 
cover dependents until the age of 26. 



"
HealthInsurance,This seems incredibly situation specific. He needs to call his union rep.  That's literally what they're paid for.
HealthInsurance,"In OP's case, the 7.5 deductible should equal the out of pocket max given the federal limits on individual yearly expenditures. 

and 7.5k is nothing compared to an ER bill if you get into a bad accident, etc. "
HealthInsurance,"perhaps there's an administrative process for doing that simply? That varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but can't hurt to ask...?"
HealthInsurance,"They did this before 2013. "
HealthInsurance,"Idk if you can get catastrophic plans in the marketplace. 

Is $7150 your deductible? That sounds like a deductible. 

It doesn’t mention anywhere in the letter what your employer was covering? Is it a really crappy insurance plan? Maybe your employer wasn’t paying anything into it and $63 really is your premium. Sounds crazy but maybe. "
HealthInsurance,"You actually have a pretty good understanding of it!  

&gt;1. If HMO covers in-network care, do the referred specialists/hospitals/clinics need to be affiliated with a given PCP? Or any in-network providers will be covered? i.e. Can you ask the PCP to see a specialist who is not affiliated with PCP but is in-network?

Any in-network providers will be covered, as long as your primary care provider makes the referral.  And yes, you can absolutely ask your PCP to see a specialist that isn’t affiliated with him/her but is in-network.  

&gt;2. Same question as 1, but pertaining to lab/radiology/blood work. Again does the PCP have to be affiliated with these providers through a Medical Group?

Same as above- as long as they’re in-network, it doesn’t matter that the PCP is affiliated with a different clinic.  A word of caution though- do not assume that lab work is in-network just because they are done at an in-network location.  For example, a few years ago I had my annual women’s health exam at an in-network clinic, and they referred me to go get labs done while I was there.  Shortly after I received a bill because the lab work was contracted through a third-party company which was not in my network.  So whenever possible I highly recommend talking to the billing department to determine exactly who will be billed for lab work, and then you can call your insurance provider or get online and make sure it will be covered.  It’s ridiculous but could save you from headaches in the long run. 

&gt;3. And lastly hospitals and in-patient care. Under HMO are members eligible to choose any in-network provider or only restricted to a Medical Group

As long as the hospital/inpatient care is in-network you're fine; it's not restricted to a specific group (e.g., it doesn't have to be the same group as that with which your PCP is affiliated).  


Let me know if you have any other questions!"
HealthInsurance,"The ACA drove many companies who had plans everywhere out of certain markets. My choices went from 6 companies, who all had lot's of plans to choose from, down to 2 for example. I can't call Cigna or Anthem or HealthNet or United Health to buy a plan off market because they no longer sell here, and OP may not be able to either depending on where they live. In some cases it's determined by your zip code and if you live a few blocks from a neighboring zip they may have access to things you don't, and visa verse. 

Let's not pretend the ACA is good for anyone but people who don't have to pay much or anything at all."
HealthInsurance,Yeah that's a typical surgery cost
HealthInsurance,"Wow, really?? That just seems...astonishing. I mean, I was in the ER not long ago, and the ""allowable amount"" for the 10-minutes I had with the doctor was over $600--not counting the amount for the hospital facilities fees. So I am surprised that an OB would ever charge that little for so much more time. "
HealthInsurance,"That does. I wasn't sure how tax credits work. I thought it meant that you would pay the full price and then you get compensated back with your tax refund.
"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; there are plenty of times where scheduled medical services could theoretically be shopped around to find similar quality at a lower price and this would certainly drive down costs.

it's a great idea. An idea that has been tried &amp; will continue to be addressed in initiatives to make health treatment more systematic in the US. It's not a silver bullet. Because there is no silver bullet."
HealthInsurance,When was the last time you had active health insurance and why did it end?
HealthInsurance,"This doesn't answer your question, but if no one has mentioned it yet, you're eligible for a hardship exemption.  Check out the the process [here](https://www.healthcare.gov/exemptions-tool/#/results/2017/details/death-in-family)

This doesn't give you a special enrollment window, but at least no matter what you'll avoid the penalty in 2018. 

Short term health plans aren't good alternative to health insurance, but if your choice ends up a short term plan or nothing at all I'd say go for a catastrophic short term plan. "
HealthInsurance,"If you’re late on payment by 30+ days then they cancel your policy altogether without any opportunity to reinstate besides a severe hardship (divorce, etc). Happened to me awhile back.  Sorry to say, but I think your gf is screwed. "
HealthInsurance,I believe this answer is Yes. You are considered covered for each month in which you have coverage for at least 1 day. So you would be covered for Jan\-May and August\-Dec. You are allowed a short term gap of less than 3 consecutive months a year. So you should be good. You will need to fill out form 8965 with your taxes next year.
HealthInsurance,I would be interested in hearing you expound on your doubts regarding the effectiveness of price transparency in reducing medical costs by increasing competition based on price \(if you feel like doing so\).
HealthInsurance,"Yes, there are literally hundreds of different brands of contacts.  You can have daily contacts, monthly contacts, weekly contacts, etc.  You need to figure out how much you want to spend (I spend $99 every 3 months for daily contacts) and it'll depend on what kind of contact you need for your eye. But there are literally TONS of options.  Also - don't get suckered into spending a bunch of money for a year's worth at a time.  You can get the prescription from the doctor with a few samples and compare costs online.  Just tell them you want to try them before you buy them but make sure you walk out with a prescription so you know what to order. Some retail places will try to get you to buy a year's worth at a time and unless you want that - it's really not necessary."
HealthInsurance,"This is retail pharmacy claim. At point of service, pharmacies can’t bill both at the same time (unless you have tricare or Medicaid as secondary). I realize medical claims you don’t have a choice, and they can usually do primary and secondary at same time and then you’d just get an EOB from secondary at the end. Since I’m aware which one is primary, I had pharmacy bill primary insurance. Paid my $10 prescription copay. And now I’m going to mail in receipt of claim to secondary. Both these plans are non high deductible. "
HealthInsurance,"The only specialist I ever see is a gynecologist for a once-a-year exam. Other than that I just go to a primary care for check ups or if I'm feeling off - I probably only see him once a year, maybe twice if I've got a cough that won't go away or an ear ache or something. Other than that, I don't recall ever having seen a specialist in the last 15-20 years."
HealthInsurance,"Every plan I’ve ever seen with copays and a deductible has _never_ applied the copays to the deductible. Traditionally, they apply to the out of pocket maximum. Are you getting the EOBs? They might clarify where that copay is going. If in doubt, call your insurance"
HealthInsurance,"all health coverage is ""local"" - your options &amp; their costs depend on a variety of factors specific to you; where you are (city, state), your expected income, how many people you want to cover, your health, etc.

As morictey notes, your changed employment situation should give you a special enrollment window. Provide a few more details &amp; we can probably provide more specific help"
HealthInsurance,Who said Aetna won't pay?  The doctor or did you contact Aetna themselves? If you haven't already I would contact Aetna and explain the situation in that you didn't know you had them as primary.  Find out if there is a way they will process the claim for you. The doctor most likely can't file them after 120 days but the insurance can still process them for you if they want.
HealthInsurance,"Call the customer service on your insurance card and ask why the claim rejected. You said that your son saw a plastic surgeon. 90% of claims are processed by a computer without any human input. So there's a chance that it saw that a plastic surgeon was the provider and automatically assumed that this was a purely cosmetic procedure.

The provider might have to do a coding review, insurance might be able to adjust the claim, or it may need to be appealed. There's several options depending on how the claim denied. 

Make sure you ask if there was any diagnoses codes with the procedure that show that it was medically necessary and not just a cosmetic procedure."
HealthInsurance,"No, federal law that was implemented with Obamacare has made it impossible unless you have a qualifying life event. Health Sharing programs are still an option for you, as are short term medical policies. These are for emergency purposes and will keep you from being billed tens of thousands of dollars from medical bills."
HealthInsurance,"Yes and no I guess. I was enrolled to have it on 4/29 but now thats the canceled date since i moved to part time. "
HealthInsurance,"Maryland expanded Medicaid coverage, and while choices have diminished practically everywhere, MD is still a pretty good state to be in your situation, health\-coverage\-availabilitywise. 

So, what sarahbobarah said"
HealthInsurance,"If you have access to a patient portal, you should be able to download a lot of your info and bring it to your new physician yourself."
HealthInsurance,Loss of coverage should be a qualifying event on healthcare.gov.  I would check out the website for options.
HealthInsurance,"I don't think so, blood calcium tests are, however. You should call the customer service number on the back of your insurance ID card though just to check"
HealthInsurance,What kind of benefit do you have? You didn’t mention paying a copay. $107 isn’t an absurd cost for a routine office visit IMO.
HealthInsurance,"Yes, but the thing is, that if you get a serious disease, they are going to attempt to prove that it was pre-existing. They will come through your medical records, and find something. Honestly, this plan is not worth a gosh darn thing"

HealthInsurance,"No ID card? :( when did he turn 23? They may have dropped him that month and he'd be eligible for a special enrollment thru the exchange,  but he'll need the group #, etc. Otherwise he'll have to wait until Nov."
HealthInsurance,"Let's say you are eligible for coverage beginning on 5/1, but you don't fill out the paperwork until 5/15.  Once you sign up the coverage would be retro to 5/1.  That's probably what happened with your friend. :)"
HealthInsurance,"where are you - city, state?"
HealthInsurance,"Typically, ""a quote of benefits is not a guarantee of payment"" that is what the insurance tells providers offices.  If you feel your insurance processed it incorrectly,  you can try to appeal it to see if they will overturn their original decision. 

Ultimately, it is the patients responsibility to also be aware of their benefits, prior to treatment.

 I got an HPV vaccine years ago that wasnt covered by my insurance at the time, and had to pay $400 for it out of pocket.  That was a very expensive lesson to be learned, but now I verify my coverage prior to anything getting done. I'd rather hear it from the insurance company's mouths than the providers."
HealthInsurance,"How did you get the visit and the allergy testing without your insurance being verified that they accepted it? I fear for your pocket when that bill comes!

Since you're going to be working full time, that is a major life change and you can apply through healthcare.gov and look over the options of plans available to you. 

In the interim, you could call and see if they could switch you to something else they would accept OR you can just find an allergist that is already on the plan you are on, and have this doctor pass over the results/medical records to them, and start getting your shots before you're terminated from your current plan. Why wait? You have insurance, use it! Just find someone who's on the plan. "
HealthInsurance,Monterey County. 25-30k ish.
HealthInsurance,"That’s correct. If your insurance won’t cover it, you’ll get an EOB showing it. This stuff can take months. All depends on your insurance company. If the hospital is demanding you pay, you can tell them you’ve yet to receive an EOB for all the bills. 

Side note, 17k is outrageous. I have what I think is the flu right now and I’m dreading going to the doctor if I need anything because I’m on new insurance and am working part time and trying not to spend money. What a time to be sick!"
HealthInsurance,LeChub FTW
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, it's called dual coverage. You'll have your parents coverage as primary coverage. The providers will firstly submit claims there and then you'll have your employer coverage second. Any remaining costs can be submitted there to see if that insurance company will pick up anymore of the cost.

You'll still have to meet deductibles like usually for each plan and what not, but it's not uncommon for individuals to have dual health or even dental insurance.

Remember that all plans are different though in there underwriting, so it wouldn't be bad to double check their specific policies."
HealthInsurance,"Oh I’m sorry for not reading closely. I saw air ambulance and my soapbox came out. 

Your plan may have special provisions for emergencies. Your best bet is probably to get a copy of your plan document (the full contract, not a summary or a handbook) and see what it says. File an appeal and exhaust your appeals. 

It is very likely the providers will still balance bill you. That is not your insurance’s fault. The provider does that all on their own. Good news is you can negotiate. I’ve seen people get bills reduced by 50% just offering to pay a lump sum. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; He's probably wrong.

yes, and the sun probably sets in the west^1


1 *(and yes, I KNOW the sun doesn't ACTUALLY set, the earth rotates, blah blah, blah, thank YOU, mr. science)*"
HealthInsurance,"I'll hop on and say ""YES"" you will pay according to the negotiated rate and your deductible.  If the IN network lab initially charges your carrier $200 for a test and the negotiated rate is $20 - and you haven't satisfied your deductible yet - you'll pay $20. Pay according to your Explanation of Benefits, not according to any bill you may get from the lab.

Hope this helps!"
HealthInsurance,"that is very disappointing to hear, and doesn't make much sense to me.

Definitely seems like a reason to give up once you get behind"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the reply, Im sorry my original post wasn't very descriptive.

Right now I am not covered. I turned 26 in March and was removed from my parents plan due to that. I have the 60 day period to try and figure out what I want to do before I will be assessed that tax penalty. I am moving to Seattle in July, with my job based insurance probably starting in September.

Realistically, I don't plan to need any medical care for the rest of the year. So what I was looking for was more of a catastrophic plan. I only want a bare minimum coverage option to avoid the tax penalty. I just don't want to pay $200/month. Because at that price the tax penalty would cost less."
HealthInsurance,"The surgery I'm talking about is an orchiectomy.

I am on a diuretic anti-androgen (spironolactone) and lithium at the same time. The lithium is to keep my bipolar disorder controlled, and as I'm a transgender woman, the anti-androgen is keeping my body from masculinizing again. Without both medications, I become dangerously unstable to the point of attempting suicide, but being on lithium and a diuretic over a long period damages your kidneys to the point of non-functioning. I've been on this combination of medications for a year and my kidney function had declined noticeably. 

An orchiectomy would solve this by making my body stop producing testosterone, which would let me stop taking the diuretic. But, since I'm transgender and this would technically be an elective surgery, my doctor told me the insurance would see the procedure as gender reassignment surgery, which they do not cover. My university's insurance does cover gender related surgeries.

My only other option is taking a testosterone blocking shot 4 times a year. My insurance company doesn't cover that either, and it costs about $1400 per shot. The orchiectomy will cost about $6000 out of pocket. I'd rather pay for one $6000 surgery than pay $6000 every year for the rest of my life. 

I'm aware that being a trans woman causes a lot of issues for insurance companies. I pay for all of my transgender medication myself; my parents have refused to help pay for any of my trans-related health care. Having this procedure is the only option that will both leave me alive at the end and not bankrupt me every year."
HealthInsurance,"I'm with you on this one. Also, isn't it further out from the time when plans were grandfathered? The only way that you could do it, was if he was a dependent on someone else's insurance, and the company decided not to provide dependent insurance. This is very confusing. Can OP post a redacted copy of the letter?"
HealthInsurance,"Hey, so if you don't have a preference for a particular doctor, the decision will probably rest on the quality of the company. What are your options? If you have Geisinger as an option, that's usually a good way to go."
HealthInsurance,"Insurance is a bat. You are betting that you might get sick, and the insurance company is betting that you won't. It's not meant to pay everything, and for 99% of people you won't get your money back. But you don't want to. You want access to any amount of healthcare, if the worst happens."
HealthInsurance,"This is the co-pays they have listed:

[Capital Blue Cross Costs](https://imgur.com/gallery/hJjdq) 

The ones circled in blue would be the ones at my income level. All of the companies cost the same for these co-pays, except for one, which charges $1 more for Name Brand Prescriptions. Is there anything else I should be looking for?"
HealthInsurance,If they would ever call me back or answer anything I asked I would
HealthInsurance,"In my case the employer/insurance company sent me a letter asking me if I wanted to enroll in COBRA after my healthcare plan ended, so keep an eye out for that."
HealthInsurance,"Unlikely:

&gt; These conclusions are consistent with those of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2004), which stated that there is ""insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening with ... EBCT [electron beam CT] scanning for coronary calcium for either the presence of severe [coronary artery stenosis] or the prediction of [coronary heart disease] events in adults at increased risk for coronary heart disease.”  The USPSTF reaffirmed their position in 2009, stating that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of using coronary artery calcification (CAC) score on electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) to screen asymptomatic men and women with no history of CHD to prevent CHD events.

That's from an Aetna coverage policy. Best chance of getting a hard yes or no, though, is to have your doctor or someone provide the code for the test, and then to call your insurance company to see if they can find anything concrete.

This is from a Wellmark one:

&gt; Coronary artery calcium scoring by means of computed tomography is considered investigational for all indications.

&gt; Based on the peer reviewed medical literature because of the lack of high-quality evidence demonstrating proved clinical outcomes or impact to treatment management from the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score either as screening tests to risk stratify patients or as a diagnostic test in symptomatic patients the use of coronary artery calcium scoring by means of computed tomography is considered investigational.

Recognizing that medical professionals are human, it might still be worth your while (even if only financially) to be wary of a doctor who recommends a test whose efficacy hasn't been proven. Because you can bet your bottom dollar that your deductible will be proven."
HealthInsurance,"From what you wrote here, the orchiectomy would be deemed an elective procedure, unless you get a medical diagnosis stating that it is needed (which it's not needed for it's intended purposes) than I'm pretty sure it's not going to be covered. 

As for the original question, no, insurance companies do NOT penalize patients for calling in and asking about benefits. They encourage it, IMO, for patients to really understand their policy and benefits. You can easily call, on your own, and ask about elective procedures and if this specific one would be covered at any benefit rate or flat out denied. They will tell you straight out, if you ask that specific question. 

Obviously, your parents are making this more difficult as they are not supportive of your trans care, so just make the phone call would be my advice. "
HealthInsurance,"So instead of using my personal bank account to pay medical bills, I can deposit money into this HSA to pay them instead? 

Am I required to use Payflex or the debit card nor required to deposit a certain amount?"
HealthInsurance,"Feel free to make a copy of the invoice and mail it to your insurance. Like another said, do not pay until you know what portion they are claiming is yours and then still ask questions if need be."
HealthInsurance,"I haven’t, after I saw the price I just figured I was stuck and that’s my only options.

I’ll contact them! I thought it was crazy too."
HealthInsurance,"If you're on an employer sponsored plan, unfortunately you cannot just cancel whenever you like.  You're locked in until your next open enrollment.  The exception here is if you experience a qualifying life event (marriage, childbirth, termination, resignation etc.)

I'm not understanding the confusion on the HSA.  If you're enrolled in the plan, and your employer is making contributions, you should have access to those funds.  I'd bring this to your employer or benefits/hr team's attention.  They cannot pick and choose who to contribute towards, they have to provide the same benefits to everyone eligible.  Fortunately with an H.S.A. , you can make catch up payments.  "
HealthInsurance,Wouldn’t his employer’s be primary?
HealthInsurance,Thank you I'll try that
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, so I have overlap of 3 months right now. Where I have both coverage. I haven't used either."
HealthInsurance,"I switched from my employer's PPO plan to an HSA plan just this year. I will state up front that I had a very attractive incentive to do so, to the tune of $200 per month deposited into the account by my employer, in addition to my normal salary.

My HSA deductible is $2700 per individual, versus $2500 on my previous PPO plan. IIRC, the Family deductibles for both were about $5k, but I'll need to verify that.

So far, my experience has been great. Having that bit of extra funds stored up even this early in the year is already going to prove useful to cover some dental work for which we would have been responsible for similar percentages either way.

One thing I do appreciate about my HSA plan, is that preventive care in almost every case is covered 100%, and for other care we simply pay the in-network allowed amount instead of a co-pay. That amount we pay is applied to the deductible, whereas PPO co-pays are not. This seems to be working towards covering my yearly deductible much more quickly, and even if not, the deposits from my employer almost completely cover my individual deductible (again, I know this may not be typical).

In addition, along with some other bad experiences I've had with in-network facilities using out-of-network providers, it's made me a lot more careful to verify, then verify, then verify everything that will happen before it happens whenever possible. For example, making sure that anything the provider *thinks* the insurance will pay for a covered service, will actually be covered by my insurance for that amount by requesting a pre-authorization from my insurer (through the provider), rather than relying on their estimates alone.

I have only been on an HSA for the past 4 months, and I know I am extremely blessed by my employer's additional benefits for HSA subscribers. Aside from that, I have so far had a much more positive experience on my HSA versus my PPO, possibly because I feel much more in control of my healthcare decisions than I was on a PPO, where I was just worried about how much my insurer will cover at the end of the day. When I'm paying a provider directly, I know the cost is the cost, and anything else my insurer provides is an added benefit.

I'd be happy to try and answer any specific questions if you have them. "
HealthInsurance,"Negative and negative... she will now be on contract, so basically self employed.  "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;There is a caveat, she is a public school teacher, so if she retires with her insurance with me on it at 51, we have access to it for life.

yeah, I wouldn't be counting on that"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you very much, I appreciate your insight."
HealthInsurance,"No, the 60 days is your new hire waiting period before coverage will begin. Ask them when coverage will begin - immediately following the 60 day waiting period, or 1st of the month following the WP?"
HealthInsurance,"No, you don't have to deposit or use the card. You can pay out of pocket and pay the monthly premium for your health insurance."
HealthInsurance,Go to the US government healthcare market website. You qualify for government assisted payments for your health insurance most likely. You can pay as little as $20 a month and get really good coverage depending on your state.
HealthInsurance,"Thanks so much for your answers. One last question, does getting travel health insurance conflict with the HSA rules? It seems to say you can't get other insurance of certain types but doesn't describe what exactly that means. "
HealthInsurance,"Since you have a HSA plan, you must pay the first $1500 before the plan starts to pay."
HealthInsurance,"I was looking into cigna or maybe united health? They seem decent "
HealthInsurance,"It all depends on where you're physician is now. Mine is part of a group, I can see any Dr there, and they are part of a larger system attached to a Hospital where ALL MY RECORDS are available to whatever physicians I see within that system. It's not Kaiser, but Kaiser operates the same."
HealthInsurance,"If you start an LLC and put two people on it, you can get an EHB plan easily. "
HealthInsurance,"Come up with a life changing event that qualifies you to apply again for Healthcare.gov. Other than that, contact brokers in your area and find a catastrophic plan or something that at least gets you covered for minimum so you're not penalized in your taxes. "
HealthInsurance,"No, it’s not reasonable — oral chemo can be extremely expensive, and there aren’t always IV alternatives. As you’re discovering, the reason rates are so good is that the coverage isn’t good... I promise you the oral chemo coverage is just the tip of the iceberg. "
HealthInsurance,"It depends which region they are in but the MCPs in PA are: UHC, Aetna, Amerihealth, Gateway, UPMC, Geisinger, and Health Partners. Not all available to all regions or plan types though."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for seeing that.  I did take a big pay cut after factoring in I lost 10 sick days a year, 15 PTO days, 401k matching, FSA, FICA taxes, and dental/medical/vision primarily paid for.  I tried to make them see that with a well-crafted simple spreadsheet but they wouldn't budge on the new rate so now I'm exploring my options."
HealthInsurance,"No, if you loose insurance, you get a ""special enrollment period"". This allows you to purchase a plan outside of the open enrollment period. You have to purchase new insurance within (iirc) 60 days from when your previous coverage ends."
HealthInsurance,"Are you going to a facility to do your sleep study or are you doing the at home version? Typically the at home version isn’t $1,000...  usually the test where you sleep in the facility is $1,000 per night."
HealthInsurance,"Go on the marketplace and choose the cheapest plan possible. It should be close to free if you’re not working "
HealthInsurance,"Damn, sorry to hear of your situation. The little legwork I did suggests that you have been snared by the mother of all gruesome loopholes.

Not sure what sort of freelance writing you do, but a detailed account of your circumstances, and any steps you take towards effecting a solution, would be snapped up by any number of publications.

One step that may be of use in getting some kind of reparations for this idiotic bureaucratic screwup - there's no other term for it, big lumbering institutions have effectively conspired to put you through a wringer - is contacting your state and federal elected officials to enlist their aid to remedy your situation. Both Federal and state governments have their fingers in the regulation of health coverage and health insurance. Yours is the kind of case ambitious legislators love being able to come to the rescue on (how's that for terrible sentence construction?).

&gt;I don't understand why I can't just opt out without having to wait until august.

you're exacly right, that's the logical solution, and ACA regulators should be able to bless an administrative exception for you - but getting that expedited needs the kind of special 'grease' those aforementioned legislators might be able to apply."
HealthInsurance,"Just a quick add since there's a focus on particular doctors...does you or your family history indicate a future need for a specific area of medicine, because that's also something to focus on besides practitioners."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Thanks. I need the coverage on paper starting 4/1 to avoid the penalty next year. And I wanted to call them earlier this week but legit couldn’t even talk without hacking up a lung. I called them yesterday and they are looking into whether they can kind of waive April’s premium while still showing me as covered for April. "
HealthInsurance,"I offered to pay missed payments (March &amp; April) and next month’s payment, but they still said it’s not possible to be reinstatement unless I qualify for special enrollment. I guess Community Health Choice isn’t as caring as your insurance company. 

I even told them to look at last year’s history to see that I don’t even use insurance so I’d be a good case to reinstate, but that didn’t work either. “Supervisor” said reinstatement is not possible since the reason was non-payment. Unfortunate. 

Would you happen to have any other advice? "
HealthInsurance,"Something seems off here. All health coverage is ""local"" - your options &amp; their costs depend on factors specific to your situation. Your place (city, state) is a big driver of options selection &amp; pricing. 

Your income qualifies you for significant premium credits, meaning you'd probably pay nothing or close to it, for ""entry-level"" coverage. Have you talked with a customer service rep at healthcare.gov?"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for the help. Is there only short term security plans available? I'm so lost on all my options.


25, parents retired and moved away. Unemployed. No life changing event in the past 60 days."
HealthInsurance,Was the hospital in network or out of network?
HealthInsurance,"I would call the insurance, as well. Quite a few insurances now automatically treat any urgent care as in network (similar to an emergency room) so that would be worth knowing about your plan"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; When an insurance claim is billed, we see procedure codes (what they did), and diagnosis codes (why they did it).

Additionally, if things don't look right, the insurance can request a copy of the doctor's record to check if they are billing correctly, so even if the doctor doesn't put the code on the claim, if they want to find out why the doctor is ordering so many lung tests, they will."
HealthInsurance,"Crutches can be bought without a prescription.  If they are not affordable,  ask someone to check local thrift stores.  They are super cheap there."
HealthInsurance,"I don't understand, why am I still being covered then? A mistake? Can my previous treatments retroactively cost us then?"
HealthInsurance,Thank you!
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I applied to the .gov insurances. Most of them quoted me 6k for a skeletal plan. Literally covered nothing if anything at all.

Again, that's just not the case.  Only the bronze category has that high of a deductible without copays.  There's still silver (with CSRs) and gold coverage available with much cheaper deductibles.  And again, silver and gold tiers are going to have copays on most plans.  

&gt;The more costly the more it offered but as I stated she makes 30K a year, and I'm not wealthy were I can just flat out covered it all.

An Ambetter Gold plan would run $313 a month with a $1000 deductible.  But, I would still recommend the Molina Silver plans if that were an option. 

&gt;Molina covers none of her current doctors and only a handful of doctors/specialist cover.

You literally said that you were taking her to a scale clinic with residents.  And you're going to complain that the plan doesn't cover her current doctors?  Within a 10 mile radius of Houston, there are 92 cardiovascular specialists in network under the Molina plan that could treat her high blood pressure (if it can't be handled by a PCP).  There are 28 endocrinologists that could treat her hyperthyroidism (again, if it couldn't be handled by a PCP).  Both include specialists that are within the UT Health system.  There are also 418 PCPs accepting new patients.  If she can't find a set of docs that work for her out of that selection, it's less a problem of the insurance and more a problem of the patient.  

There is nothing that will cover her pre-existing conditions right now.  That was the deal.  Everybody is mandated to get health insurance and in exchange, pre-existing conditions will be covered.  But, you can only enroll during open enrollment which prevents people from waiting until they get sick to purchase insurance.  

"
HealthInsurance,The problem is that provider networks change on the reg. So your best bet is to have Aetna send you confirmation in writing that you're in-network for this provider for the service you want.
HealthInsurance,"There’s no open enrollment period for Medicaid - you can apply at any time. "
HealthInsurance,"For a drug like that, your insurance company might require prior authorization, or step therapy.  Call your insurance company"
HealthInsurance,"That's good to know, I'll call tomorrow! TY!"
HealthInsurance,"$10k lmao...

What do you mean government run hopistal? you mean community health centers?

But man i never realized how expensive health care was, until i didn't have it anymore...But i did save alot of money by not having insurance, even with the obamacare tax.  Also $176 Cobra is pretty cheap.  MY company's Cobra plan was $650... I immediately said ""F*** No"", no way i'm signing up for that.   MAn i was all good and now i'm defeated and forced to pay for healthcare due to a qtip cotton swap, that's what i'm most mad about"
HealthInsurance,It depends on plan rules. Sometimes you have to take the generic and have your doctor provide evidence on why it didn’t work before you’re able to switch back to the brand name drug. I would contact the insurance company to discuss your options.
HealthInsurance,Typical retail clinic charges  for treatment of minor eye infections runs $90 \- $120. Use something like [Healthcare 311](http://www.healthcare311.com) to locate a walk\-in clinic
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the quick response! Unfortunately, there's going to be a month where we're in the process of moving before we establish residency. Are there plans that exist for just a month? Also, she earned income this year, so do we just put $0 for the medicare application?"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,I would tell them that your employer was considering offering group insurance and then decided not to offer which contributed to you missing open enrollment.
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the response. I'm planning to pay for the month (and the new plan would be provided by my existing job - not a new one), but was curious if there was some precedent, practice, etc., (like the COBRA bridge 'tactic' I've seen here) that I didn't know about. 

I'd seen other threads suggest that unpaid premiums that lead to retroactive termination of coverage generally don't get sent to collections/reported to credit agencies, but had no clue how the actual payment record actually ties into your coverage going forward. Ethics are something I absolutely want to respect -- despite the question that 100% ignored them -- but it's good to know there's a functional reason to follow-up as well.

Thanks again - I really appreciate the explanation."
HealthInsurance,"Calling their 1-800 number did the trick. They were able change something on their end that let me see the plans and enroll.

Thanks for the help!"
HealthInsurance,By state health insurance do you mean Medicaid? Or was it a Marketplace plan?
HealthInsurance,"The state insurance law part is just going to refer to whether or not the plan follows state coverage mandates. Like some states, for instance, require medical plans to cover medically necessary baby formula and pay it at 100&amp;#37;. The reason some plans can opt out is if the employer group \(your job\) through which the plan is through opt to fund/pay claims themselves, one of the payoffs is that they can opt out of state coverage mandates.

That doesn't, however, mean they don't answer to a higher authority. Insurance companies still have to be licensed with a state's department of insurance to practice in the state. That regulatory process is the one you'd be appealing to. It's worth noting that if you go that route, the state department of insurance basically forwards it to UHC and asks them to look into it. From there, someone on a special team at UHC will gather all of the evidence, ensure there's absolutely nothing that can be done, and then report back to the state. There's zero blowback for going this route, but it's worth underscoring that if you do then you shouldn't embellish anything. Just be as specific as possible.

As an aside, I wouldn't bet any money on them sending you a copy of a phone recording. There's a reason we've never seen any on YouTube"
HealthInsurance,"Not allowed if you buy your insurance through the Marketplace (although it’s extremely common anyway) - I don’t think there are regulations for other plans. 


I’d recommend seeing if there are large primary care practices in your plans network (like ones owned by hospitals). Then call the practice and book an appointment with the first available PCP taking new patients, and only then change it with your insurance. Sorry, I know it’s frustrating. "
HealthInsurance,"So... you could just update your billing address and it won’t affect your coverage. Technically yes you need to let them know you moved... but if your billing and mailing address is your new address but your physical address is still your old one you should still get all relavent mail. 

However Anthem mail is notorious for not arriving at the right address and causing issues. So just make sure to check your plan monthly and make sure premiums are being paid for.

HealthInsurance,"I give one of these to pretty much all of my self-pay clients.  They've found it to be pretty spot on. I've also used it myself in the past, with similarly positive results.  I've used Blink Health as well, and had good luck with them."
HealthInsurance,"During the 3 month period, you really only have one of two choices: COBRA and applying through healthcare.gov as this would be a life changing event. I'm sure you know that either way, you're going to have to pay for some form of insurance, and you need to make sure you pick one in advance so that there is absolutely no lapse in coverage for you.

HealthInsurance,"Hi, I’ll be moving to Virginia"
HealthInsurance,"Annual exams are covered 100%, no copay, no deductible, etc. Per ACA rules. Talk to the billing department and explain that you were there for your well woman exam and it should be rebilled accordingly. 

If you were getting 100% at the other doctor, because you have a family member working there, it's probably due to a courtesy adjustment, not necessarily that your insurance covers it 100% OR because in the past it was a yearly routine well woman exam, which would make it the 100% covered. "
HealthInsurance,"Sorry I didn't see your question earlier, but as you found out, yes! BCBS is nation wide and one of my clients in Arizona sees BCBS of almost every other state, it's still in the BCBS network and is covered, although it might be considered out of network if you are on an HMO. "
HealthInsurance,"This is what I thought would happen. It's my first time picking up a prescription with this insurance so I brought a goodRX coupon, and she said my insurance lowered it more than goodRX. "
HealthInsurance,"I don't have my book on me nor am I near my work computer but can 29914 and 29915 be billed together? 30k extra to move the camera up like half an inch. "
HealthInsurance,"I have never seen a health plan that covers elective plastic surgery. You need to prove it's a medical condition (or causing a medical condition). "
HealthInsurance,"Well, the denial happened on April 21st, but the Medicaid ending was on May 1st. I'm guessing I should go with June 21st as my deadline."
HealthInsurance,Thanks so much! Great calculator. Much more specific than others I tried. Thanks for your help!
HealthInsurance,"The question is not about a single case, but in general can they negociate a different rate for themselves versus the subscriber?"
HealthInsurance,Good luck! Don't forget that 60 day deadline from your qualifying life event to apply for a Marketplace plan.
HealthInsurance,If you are the subscriber to one of the plans this one is considered to be your primary.  Give this information out and the insurance companies will figure out what you owe.
HealthInsurance,"Yeah that’s what I’m gathering :/ maybe better to check up in a country with cheaper healthcare haha 

Thanks for the info!"
HealthInsurance,"Yes, you put your income there, household members and it gives you subsidized premiums but also shows what the full price would be. I should say the full prices are outright insane."
HealthInsurance,When you get a bill for $200k after a catastrophic illness then health insurance is *very*  helpful.
HealthInsurance,"This is the main reason me and my SO aren’t married. We have an infant daughter and since I only work part time we both qualify for free health insurance ( her through medicaid me through the market place). 
When I was at the hospital they had a social worker who helped me with all the applications for my daughters health insurance so it was pretty easy. 

It sucks not getting married for a financial reason but if you live together and have a kid together and know the plan is to eventually get married the commitment  is still there. "
HealthInsurance,"The only thing I can think of is that green card holders are generally not allowed to use Medicaid for a certain number of years.  I'm not all up-to-date on the whole immigration process, but she'll have her green card before she moves here, right? If so she can get her own insurance on the marketplace once she has her documentation since immigration is a qualifying life event for the marketplace (and green card holders are allowed to use the marketplace)"
HealthInsurance,"Honestly I would strongly suggest talking to an independent broker that is local to your area!  
  
I know of many two or three-owner LLCs that are considered small employers by local carriers and are therefore eligible for the less expensive group plans and rates.  
  
Obviously carriers all have different requirements and what is available in your area may vary from what is available in mine, but definitely reach out to a broker and give them this information, because there's a chance your LLC could qualify for group coverage.  
  
I'm also assuming your income level means you don't qualify for any subsidy, which means you're just paying 100% of individual prices. Definitely ask a local agent to look into your options for group coverage, especially if you are not planning on utilizing your coverage for frequent doctor visits etc.  
  
Good luck!  "
HealthInsurance,"search the news for 2019 health insurance. Plans are expected to continue having huge increases of 30\-60&amp;#37;. This is how it has been every year since 2014. "
HealthInsurance,"Go ahead and apply directly for Medicaid when you get there, instead of healthcare.gov- your income will put you there, and it’s faster to not have your application transferred from healthcare.gov. "
HealthInsurance,"I may be able to help you further, I actually owned and operated an Occupational Therapy Clinic in Arizona from 2012-2015. First off, find out exactly what CPT code was billed, then find out exactly what ICD10 code was billed. You can get this information from your insurance company a lot easier than from the provider (from what it sounds like). If you can get me those 2 questions answered, I will gladly help you further. 

OT is something that is so beneficial and works best when the care is continuous, let's get this resolved and get her back where she belongs!!"
HealthInsurance,"If you're on Medicaid, then seeing a specialist to get the diagnosis won't cost you anything but time. Since you're not working, you have this time....go see the specialist that they want you to see. Be proactive in your medical care and jump through the hoops that you need to jump through, to get the medicine you need. Good luck!"
HealthInsurance,"It depends on how the second hospital bills. If they bill it as an ER visit, you will likely pay another copay. If they don’t bill it as emergency room but observation room only, you will pay whatever your benefit is for an outpatient facility service. "
HealthInsurance,TN.  She still has coverage until the end of May.  My gross estimated income for 2018 is about $98000 (total household income since my wife can't work).
HealthInsurance,"Absolutely agree with the statement talk to HR, Your Broker, the insurance company and clarify those deductibles and out of pocket maximums. Dot those I's and cross those T's. You can never be too careful. "
HealthInsurance,What do you mean?
HealthInsurance,"Well, I have reread the policy a number of times, and the coverage is very comprehensive. It is different than a typical policy as it's shown in terms of $ per day, but the amounts are quite sufficient to cover extended stays in hospital and ER svces etc. My local hospital's negotiated rates are approx. $4000 daily and this plan covers more than that for unlimited period, and even extra for ICU. And it's United Health Care so not a fly by night company.

Frankly, except for the lack of psychiatric coverage (otherwise they have coverage for almost all the Obamacare mandatory items- and I dont need pregnancy or pediatric) it seems pretty good except for that one item, outpatient oral chemo. But now I read that many obamacare compliant policies are inadequate with oral chemo, but only 10% of chemo is oral, and docs can often switch to infusion of same drug.

I may get this, and supplement it with an Aflac or Cigna lump sum cancer policy that pays 50,000 or 100,000 on diagnosis, which would certainly cover almost any chemo's full cost as well as regular plans do, and switch to regular policy at year end if still an issue. My total cost for both the fixed indemnity plan and cancer plan would be around $600 monthly, vs. a regular plan on the private marketplace of about $1200.

HealthInsurance,"No.

Next question?"
HealthInsurance,"FYI - this was a problem back in the 90's with homeowner's insurance. If you called to inquire about say, replacing your roof, they would raise your rates even if you didn't submit a claim expecting you were about to submit a claim. It was widespread enough to make the national news from time to time. 

Of course back then, you got a packet of paper outlining your policy written by lawyers who wanted to make sure you had no real idea of what you were signing up for. You'd fall asleep trying to read it and shortly afterward it would be misplaced somewhere in the house so you had no idea of what your policy covered. The internet really freed up the flow of information for consumers which was a very good thing. 

another side note - BCBS (which I have) has recently made the news because they are test marketing a new policies, mostly centered around use of the ER. i.e. - if you go to the ER with chest pain and it turns out to be not a heart attack but something minor, they will no longer cover the cost of an ER visit, at all. The kicker being the decision is made long after discharge. They refused to outline to journalist how they are implementing these policies or where, but the news piece I read was centered on Kentucky. 

Honestly, I would look into picking up the school policy and keep the BCBS. Run the numbers, it may be the cheapest way to go after deductibles, co-pays and that surprise out of network radiologist that seems to pop up on every hospital bill in America. It also may save you from a rude surprise when something is unexpectedly not covered by BCBS.  Use the insurance websites to run every possible facility, doctor group, drug, etc. so you know what is covered or not covered and plan accordingly. I've been to the ER twice in the last 18 months and we saved a mint by by-passing the two nearest ER departments and going to a 3rd only another 3-4 minutes down the road. 

Just read both policies carefully so you know which policy is primary (1st to pay) because they are quick with the hate mail if the billing department screws it up. Repeat it like a zombie to every front desk person you meet: ""Insurance X is primary..."" 

Best of luck to you. 
"
HealthInsurance,"Ok cool! Thanks :) "
HealthInsurance,You can have both. Your employer sponsored insurance will be primary. You may have to contact both insurance customer service and see if there's anything they require for coordination of benefits.
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the info. So I'll need to look into California's coverage options? Is that the same as Obama care? "
HealthInsurance,"Well, that's what I've been told through a few exchanges, but the monthly is increasing dramatically, so in a way, can we get pushed out of the coverage this way?

Edit

Also, thank you for the response, it really helps a lot in thinking this through "
HealthInsurance,"The $107 sounds pretty reasonable to me for a basic doctor's visit.  

How much of the $107 you are responsible for depends on your policy.   Most policies have a deductible and the insured is responsible for 100% of the rate approved by the insurance company until the deductible is paid out.  You'll usually get an EOB form (Explanation of Benefits) in the mail, or can view it on your insurer's website, to see the amount approved by the insurance company and how much you must pay if the doctor is in Network.  "
HealthInsurance,[Huh.](http://i.imgur.com/0auxGaZ.gif)
HealthInsurance,"Depending on your income you may be eligible for a premium subsidy through the NY State of Health (that's NY name for their ""exchange""). It's actually pretty easy to figure out if you're eligible by going to the website https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/agent and entering your zip code to begin the process. Unless you had a dramatic increase in wages recently, you're probably going to get some assistance in purchasing a policy. However, if you make more than ~$30,000 annually (as a single household) you'll start to see the real cost of health insurance premiums as you describe above. The individual mandate was repealed by Trump beginning in 2019, so if you choose to go without insurance for more than 3 months you'll be taxed a penalty (but it will be less than what premiums will cost you). However, if you have a need for costly health care services while uncovered you may end up being in a bigger financial mess.

Insurance is not a scam; it's just that we in the US continue to use an old way of paying for a dramatically more expensive health care delivery system than it was built for. Some countries take your premium in the form of a tax and subsidize the cost that way. We're not there yet, but we'll get there. 

I recommend you call a broker or agent who sells health insurance on the NYS marketplace in your area. They can help you navigate the minefield of health insurance and recommend your best option. Good luck!

HealthInsurance,Check your Medicaid eligibility.
HealthInsurance,"What does customer service say when you call? This should be a simple fix, call them, tell them you dont have other insurance. They should be able to send a request to have someone review your account and either remove the other policy, or verify if it really is active"
HealthInsurance,"I can tell you my doctor's office requested a bunch of tests on me.  Quest billed insurance $1,933.  The negotiated price ended up being $199.40.  NOT exaggerating.  I just added it all up from my EOBs.  Where ever you go just make sure it's IN network.  I doubt there's much difference between the doc's office and Quest.  You're more likely to run into an ""is it in or out of network?"" issue at the doc's office."
HealthInsurance,"I'm covered for emergency care in addition to non-emergency treatment like primary care and specialists, prescriptions, etc. with my current plan, which provides the same coverage across the country. The problem is that this plan runs out in a few months. 

 I have an additional plan that only covers emergency treatment out of state (which is obviously redundant right now, but won't be when the employer insurance runs out). Instead of keeping this plan *and* paying for two sets of student insurance, I'd like to cancel this plan and get a plan with national coverage, so I don't need to buy the student insurance. Are you saying I can't get the same kind of national coverage I have now through my employer with an individual policy?"
HealthInsurance,"2 months is the limit for uninsuraced ACA penalty, right?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Is their any certain place I should start looking for information on how to get my own coverage?

healthcare.gov is ok; you may find [HealthSherpa](https://www.healthsherpa.com) a bit simpler to navigate &amp; shop. 


Texas is a difficult state for individual health coverage. Options are skimpy &amp; TX did not expand their Medicaid program so you'll need mid-teens annual income to qualify for premium credits that would reduce your monthly cost of coverage. You read that right; if you income is UNDER  around $12k, you won't qualify for premium credits."
HealthInsurance,"So does your insurance pay the doctor a flat $55 per visit, or is the $55 your co-pay for the visit, and then the insurer pays the rest? Can you post the SBC document from your insurance? This sounds very strange. Your HR department or insurance company is required to provide an SBC: https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/summary-of-benefits-and-coverage/"
HealthInsurance,"If your employer is charging no more than 9.56 percent of your income, you are probably *not* eligible for a tax credit from Covered California. https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/2018-aca-affordability-safe-harbor-percentage.aspx"
HealthInsurance,"I think you are trying to say ‘No OP, you can’t do anything about this now.  Go ahead and pay the bill in full.’ "
HealthInsurance,"Honestly it sucks that you can't get your medication. It takes too long to get a pre-auth and especially if they're saying they never got the forms. Maybe the fax number is wrong? Who knows. 

Whatever the hold up is though, visiting the urgent care repeatedly to hurt the insurance company is pointless. You're increasing wait times for other patients, wasting your own time, and wasting your copay money. Also, the insurance company makes so much money that they probably wouldn't even notice, it's a drop in the ocean, one person can't bring them down. And even if you somehow costed them millions of dollars, then they just raise premium rates next year for everyone by a few bucks to recoup that loss."
HealthInsurance,You'll qualify for a special enrollment period - You can shop for plans through Covered California
HealthInsurance,"If they dont cover it, file a claim against the insurance of the business or home he fell at maybe? Idk if this is a thing I just read a lot of reddit posts. "
HealthInsurance,"Eh, no worries!"
HealthInsurance,www.healthcare.gov
HealthInsurance,"\&gt; am I wrong to think this is a bum deal?

No. If you are charged as you've outlined, appeal. That's not how any policy should be adjudicated; as you note, it defeats the \*intent\* of the coverage design. Policies, as artifacts of human behavior, almost always contain provisions that sometimes produce unintended consequences. It's not right or wrong, it's the way it is."
HealthInsurance,"this is correct.  The coverage for which you are eligible as an employee is always primary.  

I would recommend contacting the secondary coverage and checking for details on how they coordinate benefits.  It's possible that the secondary coverage (parent's plan) could still pick up the the costs as normal even if primary denies the claim as out of network.  "
HealthInsurance,"This is great news! Thanks for the info. Any suggestions on official resources to start better understanding the grace period and what my options are? "

"
HealthInsurance,"Believe it or not, $2,000 is a relatively low deductible these days especially when compared to plans on the individual market. 

how long ago did you lose your employer plan? Loss of an employer plan is a qualifying life event that usually creates a 60 day special enrollment period allowing you to apply for a plan there. https://www.coveredca.com/individuals-and-families/getting-covered/special-enrollment/qualifying-life-events/

If you're going to want a plan starting May 1st, then you'll need to apply by next Monday, April 30th at the latest and report that your coverage is ending April 30th. If you were told you don't qualify for a special enrollment period, then whoever completed your application likely made a mistake ([assuming you're otherwise meet the eligibility requirements](https://www.coveredca.com/individuals-and-families/getting-covered/immigrants/)). Call back and try again. If they say you don't qualify, ask for an explanation specifically why your loss of coverage doesn't qualify and report back here.

Read the COBRA bridging strategy realanceps linked. Never elect that you **don't** want COBRA medical unless you're sure that you have other coverage and only if you need to elect other coverage (like dental or vision).

Regarding medicaid, they usually consider your monthly and not your annual income. If you don't have income, you could try to apply at $0 income and maybe you would qualify (though you may have wait 30 days until you can show that you have a month where your income wasn't over the upper limit)."
HealthInsurance,"I have found that when you are on SSDI and have an additional insurance, the insurance companies require SSDI (Medicare) part A &amp; B to be the primary insurance and then use your (United, BCBS, universe, Etna, etc) as the secondary.  You are not required to have Medicare SSDI part D for your prescriptions if you have coverage on your secondary insurance.  You may be eligible for ""extra help"" depending your (combined)  income paying for your prescriptions. Check with Medicare SSDI for that."
HealthInsurance,"Wheel chair van services are usually good for this. Most of the time medical transportation services have a wheel chair van or two. If you can't find any in your area from a quick google search, swing by your local Fire Department or EMS \(Rescue Squad\) building and ask them what private ambulance services operate in your area. Chances are good that those private ambulance companies offer a wheel chair van. "
HealthInsurance,"On a different note, if you only want the NY doctor to bill your primary insurance, then only give your primary insurance information. It would actually save the office time and money from having to submit claims that are just going to be denied. You do not/would not get penalized for NOT using your NJ Medicaid and seeing a doctor in NY. "
HealthInsurance,"Ask how it was coded. If it was coded as routine, your insurance can’t change the code. 

If the code needs to be changed, ask your doc to do it. "
HealthInsurance,"Ok, so first question: How new to the states? Like, moved here in the last 60 days?

Also, does your spouse qualify for benefits with his employer?"

HealthInsurance,"Sounds acceptable. 

Don't think of it as insurance. 

Think of it as bankruptcy protection. "
HealthInsurance,"They’re also allowed to charge you whatever they want for literally anything. The issue is there is zero regulation or oversight and with a for profit system, there is literally NO incentive to save money. "
HealthInsurance,"What's your income? 

There's the nevada children's program, but it looked like you have to be without for six months before you qualify. 

There's the regular nevada medicaid, which you may qualify for depending on income. 

When did your father lose health insurance? You might be in a window for a special enrollment period on the ACA. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the info. We are in a non expansion state and my new job offers health insurance. For my wife and I it'd cost over 25% of my take home pay though for even the cheapest plan. I'm just starting out though and am hourly so maybe they cover more for salaried positions, which I'll hopefully be in eventually.

The cost of healthcare is just getting so high though. I had some chronic abdominal pain + plus other symptoms that they wanted a CT scan, Endo/colonoscopy, ultrasound to try and rule out something bad. Luckily at the time we were eligible for medically needy Medicaid. I got the bills for all the procedures though. I just don't understand how anyone could afford this stuff. It's like looking at the bills I can see why insurance is so high."

HealthInsurance,"If you are reasonably healthy and don't use a lot of medical care, and can afford to fund the HSA, go for it! It doesn't actually cost that much to fund because the money comes out before any kind of taxes, in most cases. It also grows tax free and is spent tax free as long as you're spending on health care (vision, dental, chiropractic, drugs, etc also included)."
HealthInsurance,"The office manager mentions a third party. I’d hazard that the office manager reached out to that third party and asked them to rereview the claim. They very likely did and determined that, based on the _services rendered_, the codes are correct. As someone who has to deal with claim problems like this pretty often, u/okashiiusagi, that would be my first line of questioning. If the provider actually _did_ do play therapy, then the third party biller’s not going to put their contracts and reputation on the line for the next audit to discover their fraud.

It’s this simple: are the CPT codes for play therapy? (You can Google the descriptions if you get the codes.) If they’re play therapy, are those the services that were rendered? If those were the services that were rendered, why? If those were not the services rendered, someone at that office needs to be able to explain in-person howthat discrepancy is going to be rectified. And an appeal does squat."
HealthInsurance,Original poster
HealthInsurance,"Did they give you a specific reason that the appeal was denied? If so you would want to address that reason in your second appeal. Also consider talking to your hr to see if they can step-in and help. "
HealthInsurance,"Also - ask your therapist what insurance they take. If they are in network with a carrier in VA offered on healthcare.gov - great! If they are out of network you'll be paying out of pocket. Hate to be a downer but with a plan on healthcare.gov the out of network benefits are not great. You'll find that the out of network deductible is probably high enough that you'll never meet it, even with monthly appointments.  "
HealthInsurance,"Screenshot the page that says this doctor is in network, and contact Aetna again. You will only have luck by dealing with Aetna directly. Is it a Marketplace plan?"
HealthInsurance,"If you have a medically necessary surgery then the proper course of action is to visit an in-network surgeon to verify the diagnosis and medical necessity of the surgery and then that doctor's office will contact your insurance company to get a pre-authorization for the surgery under your policy.

There should also be no issue whatsoever in contacting the insurance company to determine if a procedure is covered.  However, you'd get a more accurate answer by working with a doctor's office to get a pre-authorization or at least get the billing codes the medical providers will use so you can give the codes to the insurance company when asking if it is covered.   Most health insurance plans require pre-authorization for surgery in any event and all do if the surgery involved hospitalization.   

Unlike auto and homeowner's insurance, health insurance is not experiance rated.   My insurer knows I've had major surgery and have issues which require continuing care and regular doctor visits, including some specialists and these issues could potentially cause future medical issues.  However my premiums are standard rates the same as anyone else in my age group, location and smoker status (non-smoker) would pay regardless of their medical history or existence of any pre-existing conditions.  That is the law these days for an ACA (Obamacare) compliant policy either individual or group coverage.   An insurance company insuring you under an individual or employer group ACA compliant policy cannot increase anyone's individual/family premium nor cancel an individual/family just because of their medical needs or history."
HealthInsurance," Good luck!"
HealthInsurance,"You are only on the hook for what your policy doesn't cover: the copay, the deductible, and the co-insurance. 

Providers try to get payment up front because it's easier and it also prevents them from having to go through the hassle of billing and trying to collect from patients. You would be surprised at just how many patients do NOT pay their bills after the services were provided. 

Don't take it personal, just let them know that there is only a copay for the visit, which you'll pay right now, so there is no need to have your credit card on file, nor will you allow them to keep it on file for security reasons.  "
HealthInsurance,"Physical therapy is whats known as ""conservative"" treatment. It actually costs less than an MRI scan, so in most cases, insurance will ask you to go through a round of PT before getting imaging done. 

It's a case of the insurance thinking they know better than the physician, but - there is really nothing you can do about it at this point. 

I would ask your physician for a referral to PT - go to that for 4-6 weeks and then get the MRI if still in pain. 

You can keep trying to contact your insurance of course.

HealthInsurance,"Up-voting you because  hopefully you get an answer and find some coverage. I'm in a similar situation (in Florida) but I've also never had to deal with being un-insured because I grew up in Canada. So an answer to your question would hopefully answer mine. "
HealthInsurance,"We do not qualify for chip or Medicaid. We are in Texas if that matters. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;it appears these catastrophic plans are only for under-30 unless you have a hardship.

well, ""true"" catastrophic plans - in ACA world, plans *marketed* with that term - are for under 30s. But you can find plans with high deductibles that should cost you less in premiums than, say, silver-level plans.

&gt;We will get a travel plan to cover intl costs and repatriation in the event of something serious. 

Take a close look at policy terms for travel coverage. Depending on *where* you're traveling, your ""domestic"" coverage may be adequate for your needs. For example, Costa Rica has high quality, inexpensive health care - it's a travel destination for some looking for certain kinds of affordable health treatment. US embassy websites and/or staff sometimes have useful info on the kind of coverage you may want to look into."
HealthInsurance,"Also it does appear that Nevada only has two ""On Exchange"" issuers this year, and they both appear likely to be offering only HMO plans with no out of network coverage. One is Health Plan of Nevada (United Healthcare) and the other is Centene (SilverSummit Healthplan). Until last year, Anthem offered plans in at least some areas of Nevada ""on Exchange"", but they dropped out for 2018."
HealthInsurance,"I have never heard of the distance thing. If I had to guess, maybe because if it’s closer than that, it’s more convenient for you in case you were going in with something where you wouldn’t want to drive so far where perhaps a closer urgent care facility would tempt you you have the insurance company (and you) pay more? But that’s a super wild guess. And they can tell you how strict they are with the precise distance. But I doubt they are that strict if it’s a mile or two off.

As far as the PCP being part of your group. If you mean in your network, it would be in your best interest. If your plan has out of network (OON) benefits, you will end up paying more for an OON PCP, and if you don’t have OON benefits, you will be responsible for everything they bill you with insurance paying zero."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Could I pretend I am going on a trip and tell them I need to pick the medication up a few days early

Thanks for the feedback;

1. I will be sure to include run time, it's a good idea.

2.  I did say health sharing ministries are not insurance, i do agree it could of been expanded upon. I think there's tons off confusion with these programs, there not insurance and do not have the regulations and protections from the state insurance does.

I am not against health sharing programs, my job is to inform people of the pros and cons and let them decide. 

3. I'm sorry you didn't like the podcast

4. Glad you atleast  found something positive "
HealthInsurance,"When your coverage involves networks, its coverage of your treatment is more generous for - or *exclusively* devoted to - network clinicians and facilities.

So no, your doctor doesn't have to be in ""your group"" (what's ""your group""?), but if you want your plan to pay generously, or maybe at all, then yeah, your doctor has to be in ""your group""."
HealthInsurance,"Regional in that a Blue Plan has to be offered in your zip code.  Where I'm at, the local Blue doesn't offer any individual coverage on the exchange at all in the state.  Other states may only offer coverage in certain zip codes depending on that zip's proximity to network providers, but it's likely coverage is either statewide, or not at all available in your particular state."

HealthInsurance,"Sorry all, I should’ve clarified a bit. I do have an in network deductible of $1500. I also have an HSA which I am thinking I can possibly use to pay this bill....I am just a bit new to this plan as I’ve been on my parent’s insurance which worked differently prior. "
HealthInsurance,"Call and see if there's *anyone* with a higher authority you can talk to at the therapist's office. They need to submit the claims with the *proper* code, not appeal the wrong code.  Sometimes I'm amazed at the stupidity.  It's probably a miscommunication in their office but your daughter is paying for it with delayed treatment.  If at ALL possible - get on a list for a new provider (yes there's probably a wait).  At least get on a wait list so if this drags out another month you have an alternative.  It's in the hands of the provider at this point. I'd go down there in person and pitch a fit."
HealthInsurance,"It could be the coverage options are wider on the more expensive plan. Just a guess... Obviously if it costs more and doesn't give any additional benefit, take it off your list."
HealthInsurance,"the new penalty repeal doesn't take effect until 2019. if you go without coverage in 2019, you won't pay a penalty when you file taxes in 2020. so you still need health insurance this year if you want to avoid the fee.

if you're losing a job you should qualify for special enrollment. you can pick a ""catastrophic plan"", which is the lowest premium but you would pay the most out of pocket in the case of an emergency. you could also do COBRA to continue your employers healthcare plan until you get a new job. 

healthcare.gov can tell you more about whether you qualify for special enrollment, or for medicaid: https://www.healthcare.gov/screener/"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, that helps.  I have BCBS in Illinois so I am hoping for something similar.

At this point I am thinking of getting just two or three of the tests done and seeing how much the cost is compared to the sticker price, then if it's lower than something like requestatest I'll get the rest of the tests done."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;This kind of feels like a scam, some kind of malpractice to me. But I also have no idea what I'm talking about. What's going on here? 

My remarks won't tell you what to do now. 

I'm mostly confirming what you're experiencing; that insurers' information on their network providers is a mess (it isn't just Anthem), that that mess is an industry scandal  of long duration, that it has been addressed in federal &amp; state legislation, and that it has not gotten much better, if at all


&gt;Should I just switch PCPs and forget this stupid crap? 

basically this. Your complaint would be added to the very tall stack...."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, you're probably right. Seems like a dumb hill to die on"
HealthInsurance,"zebra's assumed you have employer-sponsored health coverage. can you confirm?

all health coverage is ""local"" - your coverage options, and their costs to you, depend on factors specific to you - where you are (city, state), your expected annual income, your health status and the health status of each person to be covered, etc, etc. Answer more of these questions and can give you more actionable suggestions about what you might expect. 

While you'll want to evaluate how any options  you have available cover your wife's asthma, you *shouldn't* find that that condition impacts your premium costs for coverage. It *may* factor in to what you pay for any needed care."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Do you have a way to record phone calls?

Be careful on this- depending on your/ the customer service rep's location, it may be illegal to record the call without consent. I can almost guarantee if you tell them you are recording (Cigna, no clue on the marketplace) that they will hang up on you."
HealthInsurance,"If you never pay the initial April premium then the plan will never begin (you won't owe anything), but you'll not be able to sign up for another plan. Usually the company is only going to give you 30 days from either the effective date or the date you applied (sometimes less). If you haven't paid for April yet and you want insurance, you should do so ASAP because you're probably running out of time to do so. Unless you have some other qualifying life event, you'll not be able to start a new plan until January 1st, 2019 (enrolling 11/1-12/15).

You should be able to pay for just April's premium. If you're receiving an advance premium tax credit (subsidy), then your grace period for payments **after you make your initial premium payment** will be 90 days. If you're not getting a subsidy then your payment grace period will probably be 30 days (check with your company/contract). 

Once you make your initial premium payment, don't let your policy term for non-payment. That used to be OK, but it's not with ACA plans (collections &amp; potential problems enrolling in future plans).

In the future, if you don't have a bill or an ID card, call the insurance company and see if you can get a digital copy or have a representative read you the numbers on the card (you don't actually need the physical card)."
HealthInsurance,"Hey, so in addition to what everyone else has said, how many more days of your med do you have?  Because many lgbtq centers (even if you're not gay) have access to programs that will get you an emergency month supply while you sort this out.

HealthInsurance,"When were you ""accepted"" in the system and when did it tell you you would be effective? From my experience, you have to apply by the 15th of the month to then be eligible for the 1st of the following month. If you apply after the 15th (of April), then you're not going to be effective until June 1st, which would be why they haven't contacted you yet. 

If you applied prior to April 15th, then I would simply call the marketplace (they are actually really very good at helping in almost every situation, including yours) and let them help you resolve this. "

HealthInsurance,"Respond to the center telling them they've made a billing error, that your records indicate you don't owe them anything (because the absence of a bill in the records you have indicates you don't owe them anything) and that if they can provide details of their previous efforts, perhaps you can help them correct it. There's a decent percentage chance you'll never hear from them again."
HealthInsurance,"That's what I was telling him that it's for those under 30, I'm over that age limit. He sees the individual out of pocket max, at $7,150 And thinks that automatically makes it a catastrophic insurance plan. "
HealthInsurance,"Do you mean the deductible or out of pocket max? They would be covered at a higher percentage when you reach the deductible. They would be covered entirely if you've met the out of pocket max (assuming it's an in network doctor / drug / service). 

1. If she elects employer coverage and drops your plan, yes her plan starts at $0. She may have a lower deductible as an individual employee or may not have a deductible at all depending on the plan set up. 

2. Yes. She can stay entirely on your plan until she's 26 though. That might be your best option, for the rest of this year at least but that will also depend on the structure of her employer plans. 

3. Will be entirely dependent on the premium and plans available to her through her job. "
HealthInsurance,Just call the customer service number on the back of your insurance card. Tell them who you want to be your pcp. You can probably do this online as well.
HealthInsurance,"ACA is extremely difficult to deal with for situations like this. An easy fix is to do a change of address to a family member that is at least a county over. The letter from the Post Office grants a special enrollment period due to a move. Once the insurance is started, just change his address back to his current one. It works. 

The only other option is to start a group plan through his LLC. Group plans can be started at any time during the year and are not subject to the open enrollment associated with individual insurance. "
HealthInsurance,"Did you previously have health insurance for your wife through the last job? If so, when did that coverage terminate? "
HealthInsurance,"Way too vague. If he contacted the insurance and they told him where to go then he could have easily appealed the denials but it is probably too late now.  

Also, not to be a jerk, but the talk about ruining his life? So he felt his life was ruined but didnt even bother to call and ask WHY the insurance denied the claims? Just got the bill and went ""aww shucks""??  -- i doubt it. Which likely means you aren't getting the whole story."
HealthInsurance,"Umm all of those prices are insanely low! You have nothing to worry about "
HealthInsurance,How do i apply for Cobra? My ex-eompolyeer benefit adminstrator is not responding to my emails and I don't have her number. Can i start the process myself or it has to be through my empolyer?
HealthInsurance,"Maybe somebody deleted a comment, but if you're saying this: ""the key is that he has to be in school"", then that is incorrect and the page you are linking to says that. It says:

&gt; Under current law, if your plan covers children, **you can now add or keep your children on your health insurance policy until they turn 26 years old.**
&gt; 
&gt; Children can join or remain on a parent's plan **even if they are:**
&gt;

It's saying even if, not only if."
HealthInsurance,Make sure they are IN NETWORK!!
HealthInsurance,"I'm very familiar with PHCS and MultiPlan Network, the only thing I would really question is if this particular plan (LifeShield) is an ACA approved plan. Other than that, and if it is, then it looks good from what I can see so far...I would be that it's not though, especially since it sounds cheap to you, that means you got other quotes, but again...check if it's an approved plan. 

Non ACA plans will not count towards your tax credit and you will be stuck with a fine at the end of the year. "
HealthInsurance,"Unfortunately, I am my HR. 

They told me I need to have a failed history with “one of the following drugs”. I tried one for a month and it failed, they still denied the appeal and now are telling me to try three other drugs, one of which is an antidepressant I really don’t want to go on. My doctor’s office said that with OptumRX it is likely I will have to try each for six weeks. "
HealthInsurance,"They paid primary initially and did the refund. This still qualifies as another insurance processing primary. "
HealthInsurance,"You can contact and work with a local broker that will help you find insurance. 

However, in my experience, plans on the Healthcare.gov are usually more affordable, even without subsidies, than insurance companies found through brokers. 

Are you sure about only HMO's being available? I've worked with healthcare.gov with 5 different states (*albeit, not Nevada) and there were always choices of both HMO's, PPO's and POS. "
HealthInsurance,"www.healthcare.gov would be my first place.  You might not be able to get a subsidy, but start there - and enter your info to SEE if you can get a subsidy. Depends on a lot of things. "
HealthInsurance,"They still might. Insurance hasn't been involved yet. I did contact them before I went to the doctor (knew I'd need a sleep study) and they said they ""require no preauthorization"" for sleep studies. I'm at the referral stage, trying to do a home study. Haven't heard yet if Doctor changed the referral...."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;going with any major provider is going to cost her an arm and a leg

not necessarily. But let's back up.

All health coverage is ""local"" - options, and their costs, depend on a variety of specific circumstances. You've named some - but if you can, give us an idea of her anticipated annual income, and where she is in PA - city is close enough. 

Most importantly right now - why is she shopping now? The annual enrollment window's long since closed. She needs to be eligible for a special enrollment period to enroll now. Anything special going on with her?
"
HealthInsurance,"Exactly,  previous reply is incorrect. Ever since ACA was enacted it's 26 and you don't need a reason. It's possible his mother has decided to remove him from the policy since it probably costs her $$ to have him on.  It's also possible the plan is self-funded, which if that is the case, ACA doesn't apply."
HealthInsurance,"The lab rep you spoke to is a moron. The provider rendering services is the one who will bill your insurance. Your doctor may draw the blood and provide the orders, but the lab is the one who will _do_ the lab work and is thus the one who will _bill_ for the lab work.

Quest has national contracts with all major insurance companies and have really assembly lined the process so their rates are typically bottom of the barrel.

The rates Quest quoted you are their “billed amount” but that’s a completely arbitrary number. Their contracted rate varies by insurance company and by code, so they typically don’t know those. They can, and it’s 2018 so we all know why they should, but they don’t. Contrary to what u/fartmitten and u/jackasher, there are major insurance companies that can and provide the contracted rates for any and all codes for any and all procedure codes (I work at a top 5 insurer) but it varies by insurance company and it varies by lab code, so the only way you’ll be able to find out is if you can get the codes and if you have an insurance company that’s willing to makeup for what most medical providers won’t do (even though they very well can.)

Also, the billed amounts for major labs like Quest and Labcorp and exorbitant because they use the difference as a tax write off. On average, I see lab work that’s discounted to 10% of the billed amount. Notice that u/amyhobbit’s anecdotal numbers match up to that.

If nothing else, call the insurance and ask if they’ll provide that information if you get CPT codes (and maybe a tax ID.)"
HealthInsurance,"high deductible healthcare plan. You said you switched insurance with your new job. if you switched to an hdhp, that'd be an obvious source for the discrepancy in charges you were expecting. "
HealthInsurance,"There are a few things that will happen when you get health services. The hospital will bill you exorbitantly. This is called the bill rate. That's likely the 60k. By being on insurance, you are entitled to pay only the negotiated contracted rate. That might be just 11k. It's a discount for being a member of a plan. How much of that negotiated rate you pay vs your insurance paying will be determined by what your deductible is and coinsurance level. 

Have you received any EOB's yet? That will show you the breakdown of all the charges. It's common for those to take 4-6 weeks to be processed, especially in an ER situation. 

Assuming you were in network, the most you could be on the hook for as an in network patient in a plan year is $7150 due to federal limits. "
HealthInsurance,"If you have dependents enrolled under your health plan, yes.  The annual maximum decreased from 6900 to 6850.  Yay!"
HealthInsurance,What's your deductible and out of pocket?
HealthInsurance,"Hospital bills are commonly sent out before insurance fully processes. Wait until you get the EOB from your insurance. "
HealthInsurance,"I didn’t realize it would only be 15 dollars. I’ll call my insurance company to see if I can get it a little earlier but if not, I’ll just pay for it. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; wow 10 hours and nothing.

:(

&gt; start calling around.

Yep, that's what I'm going to have to do

HealthInsurance,I should also mention that I'm not familiar with anything related to US insurance. I moved to Israel after college and before that was only on my parent's insurance.  What's the marketplace?

HealthInsurance,"Try two separate things.  If both come off, great!  If only one comes off, you are still in a better position.

**1. FQHCs**

You can try using an [FQHC](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/).  Long story short, they get federal grants that mean that prescriptions they write can get filled cheaper (it's called the [Section 330B drug pricing program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/340B_Drug_Pricing_Program)).

**2. Buy some frickin insurance**

If you don't qualify for a [Special Enrollment Period](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/), you can also just buy unsubsidized health insurance, which [you can do any time](https://www.healthcare.gov/private-plan-exceptions-outside-open-enrollment/).  You will need to find an independent health insurance broker to do this in most states rather than online due to archaic state laws though.  "
HealthInsurance,"Insurance is from dependents insurance (company) "
HealthInsurance,"Assuming you stay in network, and at a worst case scenario: 

PPO = 12*153 + 4000 = $5,836

HDHP = 12*114 + 4000 - 600 = $4,768

You save $1000 in case of maxing out the plan by choosing the HDHP. I'm going to assume that copays on the PPO do not count against the deductible but to the out of pocket max. If you don't use the doctor much, I'd do the HDHP, because it's cheaper in case of large expenditures, and you can fund the HSA yourself also, which is a triple advantage tax account. "
HealthInsurance,"Based on you mentioning you're coming off your parents' plan, &amp; guessing their coverage is employer-sponsored, I'm gonna jump in &amp; suggest you [take a look at this COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/), mainly because it should make clear it can give you extra days - weeks, even! - to plan your next moves. My feeling is you have 3 steps

1) take advantage of your COBRA bridge hedge for a couple of months. Assuming all goes according to the ideal model (no need for coverage);

2) shop your state's exchange for coverage where you are now, for June. Forecast low 2018 earnings based on what your situation is at the time you estimate (ignoring your WA job); then

3) Once you have a Washington address, it looks like you'll eventually want to [visit Washington's health benefits exchange](https://www.wahbexchange.org/) to figure your coverage options for July-August. My hunch is you could guesstimate low earnings, pay little in premiums now, &amp; then ""refund"" your tax credits when you pay taxes for 2018, sometime in 2019 after you're making money."

HealthInsurance,"&gt; They are the worst when it comes to helpful advice.

Speaking of worst, and health coverage, everything about Texas is the worst. It's my nominee for THE worst place in the US to be age 60-65 &amp; in need of health insurance."
HealthInsurance,"Hi! So your doctor's office should be able to help you with this.  You are correct that it makes no sense that your out of pocket max would be less than your deductible.  The max is always more or equal to the deductible.  You need to contact someone (broker, HR, insurance company) to see what your deductible and OOP maximums are.

A few things:

Is this a medically necessary procedure? If not it might not be covered at all, which would explain the $6,800 quote.

Is everyone who is going to touch you ""IN NETWORK"" for the carrier? This includes lab work, surgery, anesthesia, hospital, etc. Especially surgeons and anesthesia.  People get hit with out of network anesthesia bills ALL the time.

Like I mentioned previously, the doctor's office or hospital will be able to give you a better estimate of how much your cost will be but it's your responsibility to double check that everyone who touches you is IN NETWORK.

Those cost estimators often aren't very accurate. It's a good idea but typically a flawed app.

Good luck!"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for the advice about national versus regional. I might even be able to keep my doctors, and I will check as soon as possible! "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you both! I had it pre-authorized, so it might require some kind of step therapy like you said. I'm planning on giving them a call in a day or two. "

HealthInsurance,"It's not so hard to find insurance, but it is hard to get good insurance that doesn't have a huge deductible.

It also is near impossible to get insurance when it isn't an open enrollment period (usually Nov to Dec 15 for Jan 1 start date) unless you qualify for a [special enrollment period](https://www.healthcare.gov/screener/).  Most of the reasons for a special enrollment period relate to the loss of a prior policy but check out the list to see if you qualify, or call the customer service line at healthcare.gov.

"
HealthInsurance,I'd ask your attorney.
HealthInsurance,"Yeah $38 doesn’t make sense to me either. Did you get it in writing? Was the provider that you went to In Network? What else did you insurance company say? "
HealthInsurance,How does that work exactly? I'm technically paying 450 but they're giving my subsidies for most of it?
HealthInsurance,"Looking online, it doesn't seem like disability payments qualify as income, so I would list income as 0 in that regard (estimating doesn't make sense, since future job will change your status and you can update accurately at that time).  
The reason the CA health care site is asking for income is to determine if you qualify for premium reductions or Medicaid. In your case, I'm guessing an income of 0 would qualify you for Medicaid. Your next task would be to figure out if your current treating physicians will accept Medicaid as payment or not. If they do, then you should enroll in Medicaid (I think it's called MediCal in CA) and use that for your doctor's visits. Hope this helps!"
HealthInsurance,Woooo for OP!  Thanks /u/stinkyturtles.
HealthInsurance,here's a walkthru of a [COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) that outlines the basics. Post questions if you have 'em
HealthInsurance,"I’m 19/F and I split from my parent Insurance because I’m sick of them busy-nosing around.

Went on to market place during enrollment period, checked around to find a psychiatrist/doctor who would take certain plans before hand - so that I wouldn’t have insurance in name only and have it be useless because no one would take it.

Grow the fuck up.

When I knew all my bullshit stemmed from untreated ADHD, I got an appointment the moment my step-Dad (account head) maxed out the family deductible because of his heart problem. Immediately paid off all charges to minimize any sign that I even see a psych. Even asked my psych to note it as a “check-up” visit to avoid any question. At most, I get labeled a hypochondriac.

The moment I knew I’ll be on a steady dose of drugs for a while, I look for what’s the least amount I can pay for I without insurance, just in case- GoodRx is the best option. Because then as long as I can find a GP who’s willing to continue on writing my script, and proving to my GP that I will NOT, under any circumstances, be reliant on the drugs. 

(Let’s just be clear that I call my ADHD scripts drugs rather than medication because to me, there’s a distinction. Medication is for the sick, I’m not, my brain is just fucked up. Drugs, while carrying a rather crude overtone - is much more preferable to me. I’d rather be seen as a high achieving eccentric who does “drug”, rather than blaming ADHD and claiming I’m “disabled” in anyway. It’s pathetic. And if it were up to me, I’d fucking remove ADHD from the ADA as a disability.)

I make $1200/month working part-time, pay for my schooling at a community college in full. Pay for all utilities in my house (water, gas, electricity, wifi, house insurance), that takes $500. Health Insurance eats $130/monthly..I also set aside $200 for emergency.

The rest, I put 15% in my saving. Have a license but I don’t drive, take the bus - save on gas and car insurance. Thrift shop for clothes and don’t eat much (or I eat at my aunt’s house - free food!)


So if you don’t want them to bother your business, man the fuck up and split away as much as you can. Not going around being a bitch and complaining life is too hard.

ADHD isn’t a fucking excuse, it’s an explanation, but the moment you use it as a crutch to abdicate your responsibilities - you lose. "
HealthInsurance,Thank you very much! I've heard about the birthday rule but I've also heard in California they will always make HMO primary.
HealthInsurance,"Your comments and others got me to research this better.  She was automatically enrolled in Medicare after being on social security disability for 2 years.  "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;we were checked in officially, and had to be checked out

So your wife wasn't  admitted to the hospital. If your insurer DOES treat the visit as an emergency, gettingused has answered your question; if not, ksande has. The ""check\-in"" you mention is more a matter of your ED's process management. They probably should do a better job of clarifying what that step means for you; as with too many enterprises, staff treat their processes as something only THEY need to have any comprehension of"
HealthInsurance,5 years ago you could just sign up for another insurance plan. Those days are gone. Now you are just SOL
HealthInsurance,"Keep medicaid, have your parents pay the private pay rate for the mental health services. Medicaid will still cover any prescriptions you may require. I bet it would come out to be  a wash."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. Yes, it seems more logical as preventive medicine tends to save more in the long run and given the data I see on CBT for elderly and/or those with mental disorders providing a health services through telemedicine would be cost effective. 

Another idea I had would be to provide mobile screening services and at house patient visits from doctors in rural care settings or communities (apartments).

I would be curious if you know of any other ideas?"
HealthInsurance,"Hmm. That doesn't sound right to me. Rural areas usually means more Medicare and Medicaid, and they don't pay poorly. I find they sometimes pay better than other HMO's and PPO's when you consider third party payors that some companies use (I'm talking to you BCBS who uses ASH to pay chiropractors in AZ). If I was a doctor, I would snatch this practice up. 2K patients, a demand in the area, it could be a real money maker if ran properly. My guess is more likely that the business end wasn't ran properly, and from my experience. "
HealthInsurance,They received a late payment .
HealthInsurance,"Thank you, ill read it today. Would I have to let those tike lines run out before I have cause to conplain?"
HealthInsurance,Be sure to read the questions carefully. Oftentimes the question will exclude you if you have been denied *due to health reasons* while other times the denial can be for any reason.
HealthInsurance,"Yep, I have the denial letter in my bureau.

I did find out that if the Marketplace plans are more than 9 percent of my income, I can apply for an exemption so that works as well."
HealthInsurance,"The new doctor was not out of network, but my family member works at the hospital the old doctor is affiliated with, which is why insurance covers appointments there 100%.

HealthInsurance,"I ended up calling UHC again and explained the situation to them. Essentially they said that they are transferring the case to their balance billing department.

They said that they dont think Aetna is treating me fairly so they are elevating it to a department that will call aetna and argue over who pays what. 

Not sure if this is a resolution since it will take 30-45 days for them to figure it out. Even then, UHC did not actually say they would pay if Aetna still refuses to pay.

Thanks for the help everyone!"
HealthInsurance,"No I did not get a subsidy. Seems like I’m out of luck. 

I don’t have any health issues and I didn’t even use my insurance last year but would have liked to have it just in case. "
HealthInsurance,"**340B Drug Pricing Program**

The 340B Drug Discount Program is a US federal government program created in 1992 that requires drug manufacturers to provide outpatient drugs to eligible health care organizations and covered entities at significantly reduced prices. The intent of the program is to allow covered entities to ""[s]tretch scarce federal resources as far as possible, reaching more eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services."" Maintaining services and lowering medication costs for patients is consistent with the purpose of the program, which is named for the section authorizing it in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) It was enacted by Congress as part of a larger bill signed into law by President George HW Bush.

HealthInsurance,"As a matter of fact, they do have a rollover. I'll look into this when I get around to clearing up some of my more pressing debts."
HealthInsurance,"Where do you live? "
HealthInsurance,"Hey, so if you don't have a preference for a particular doctor, the decision will probably rest on the quality of the company. What are your options? If you have Geisinger as an option, that's usually a good way to go."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Also, isn't it further out from the time when plans were grandfathered?

Can you clarify what you mean by this?"
HealthInsurance,"Some companies accept a single employee. But usually it is two. But it isn't hard to just put your wife as a W2 employee in order to get insurance. You have to pay a little more in payroll taxes, but so what, at least you will be insured."
HealthInsurance,Oh wow! Thank you! Good luck!
HealthInsurance,Can you post a link to an SBC of a plan where the plan's overall deductible does not apply to the maximum out-of-pocket cap? Thanks in advance
HealthInsurance,"Sorry, I meant that just about every grandfathered plans are no longer available.  "
HealthInsurance,"Since COBRA is a continuation of your employer plan, any medical costs that have gone towards your deductible and max out of pocket this year will carry over to your COBRA plan. If you were to buy a new plan your out of pocket costs would reset (just in case you were considering this)."
HealthInsurance,"Look here: https://www.healthcare.gov/screener/
"
HealthInsurance,"EDIT: I've done some more research so I'm changing my question I original had here.

It seems like there is now a ban on Maximum Lifetime Benefit and Maximum Annual Benefit due to the Affordable Care Act. I believe these are the terms I was looking for when I wrote my original post about not wanting to get financially sunk from a major unforeseen medical expense. Apparently this ban on ""maximum lifetime/annual benefit"" means that I wouldn't have to worry about having to pay out of pocket for $1,000,000+ of treatment due to hitting a maximum insurance payout*. However, I am still left with a couple questions.

1. Just because there isn't a max at which point insurance will cease contributing, it doesn't mean that at some point insurance will pay out only a trivial amount. For instance, after $1,000,000 insurance may still pay but only 5% and then you have a 95% coinsurance which would basically amount to you paying the whole thing anyway. Does this ever happen and if so what term is used for this so I can avoid these plans? 

2. I tried multiple different queries asking if Medi-cal had a Maximum Lifetime/Annual Benefit but couldn't find any info. I'm assuming it does not and is counted as a ""new plan"" which means it must have an unlimited maximum as per ACA, but it bothers me that I couldn't find a definitive answer anywhere.

Thanks again for the help.

*My friend went through this personally and ended up having to foot a $200,000+ bill out of pocket after their max was reached which is why I'm paranoid"
HealthInsurance,First hospital didn’t have the proper equipment to provide care to the fullest extent he needed
HealthInsurance,Double dip no? Why does OP not get it?
HealthInsurance,What state do you live in?
HealthInsurance,"&gt;That is ridiculous that they won’t take into account that another insurance paid primary. 

But UHC didnt pay primary, they took all their $ back because they are secondary
"
HealthInsurance,"No we been doing good keeping her home, no job lose. She never had insurance to begin with    
"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"That sounds really, really odd that you'd have to go into the office and pay for an office visit just for refill appointments. What sort of plan do you have? You may be able to find another specialist that doesn't require this -- this feels like the specialist just trying to get more insurance payments. "
HealthInsurance,Okay thank you! Yeah the prescription itself wasn’t bad- $17. I guess I was just surprised to see the bill not realizing that’s what the HSA was for.
HealthInsurance,"use something like [HealthCare BlueBook](https://www.healthcarebluebook.com/page_ConsumerFront.aspx) to gauge whether your bill is about right for where you are &amp; what was done. Not perfect, but ok for ballpark comparison purposes"
HealthInsurance,Almost as good as that old chestnut about not having the Obamacare because you are covered through your employer.
HealthInsurance,"CHIP if you qualify based on income (https://www.healthsherpa.com/blog/childrens-health-insurance-program-chip/), or a Marketplace plan if you don't. But if it's Marketplace, you'll need to either qualify for a Special Enrollment Period or wait until Open Enrollment at the end of the year. "
HealthInsurance,"I’m a non smoker.
Thank you for all that info when I get home I’ll review in detail!

You’re a life saver, literally!"
HealthInsurance,"That's a pretty rough situation. I don't have an answer. Only thing I can tell you is that most most Medicare advantage or supplement plans require that you're enrolled in part A and B. So you'd most likely be unable to get a supplement policy even. You may be stuck paying OOP until August for anything not covered by part A, which is damn near everything."
HealthInsurance,I just sent you a link to a picture in your inbox if that gives a bit more info. I'm not too sure what you mean about integrated deductible. I have never used this insurance before since I didn't want to pay out of pocket. This is my first time using it and was surprised I got the discount!
HealthInsurance,"Don’t worry about this right now. I know that seems insane but focus on your wife and the baby. Deal with this when you get home. The hospital will send you a ton of bills that you will have to sort out pretty much regardless, so just shelve this and enjoy your new baby. 

When you’re home and can focus, you need to escalate like MAD through your HR. "
HealthInsurance,"short answer is yes; shop via something like HealthSherpa to get the hang of it. Note that depending on your projected income  you may qualify for premium credits for ACA coverage, while if you were to elect COBRA you'd pay the full premium cost of the employer\-sponsored coverage you're leaving behind \- the price of which I'm gonna predict you won't be thrilled about."

HealthInsurance,"Yep, you can buy short term life insurance for periods of up to 90 days (google short term life insurance). The thing is, it’s not going to help you much in checkup country. It doesn’t cover preexisting conditions and is more intended as a way to not go broke if you break your leg. "
HealthInsurance,"Have you checked your state's insurance exchange through healthcare.gov yet to see what policies are available?  Where I live there are only one health insurance company writing individual policies (either through the exchange or not) and the deductibles are very large.   I'd check into what's available, see what doctors are in network and what the coverages are and perhaps discuss the drug with them ASAP to help you make your decision."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"The employers doing this are those that skew male. If your employer has a disproportionately high number of male employees \(like Truck drivers or IT jobs\) they tend to reject spouses that turn down insurance. The cost of providing healthcare to women is much more than men. Conversely, if your job is more 50/50 or skews female, they are likely to seek the other spouse as they can charge much more for insurance without undue additional spend. "
HealthInsurance,Do you find the coupons to be pretty accurate once you show up at the pharmacy to buy?
HealthInsurance,"It depends a lot on your zip code, state, and income level. If your kids qualify for CHIP or Medicaid (and many people are often surprised just how high your family income can be, for the kids to qualify), that is usually going to be a cheaper option, if your employer doesn't pay anything toward the kids' coverage on the employer plan. Spouse - many people are having their spouse take coverage at the spouse's employer, as this is cheaper than adding them to the other one's employer policy."
HealthInsurance,Thank you very much! I hadn't thought about checking the in network. Silly me!
HealthInsurance,I took the catastrophic plan
HealthInsurance,lol I am sorry. Force of habit.
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for all the help!! We figured out a gameplan for this year with your insights.  Again, Thank You."
HealthInsurance,"Capital blue or geissinger. Both are fine "
HealthInsurance,"If the sleep study is $1000, you're getting a bargain. But yes, you will typically get the results before you make payment. Probably before insurance is even billed."
HealthInsurance,"Companies like Multiplan keep calling me offering no deductible PPOs  with low premiums that are supposedly accepted by 90&amp;#37; of  hospitals/providers in the nation.  Then they go on to say the policy  will expire soon to try to rush me to buy their proposed policy. Is this  some sort of common scam I should be aware of? There's gotta be some  catch to this. "
HealthInsurance,"My income just increased from 60k up to 92k and they dropped us from chip. "
HealthInsurance,"As a patient advocate, I don't feel that there is anything I could do for you. You had the opportunity to get health insurance, and you didn't, that was your mistake and ignorance about the rules is not a valid argument. At this point, I would advise you to pay cash for your Humira (or generic version) or try other ways to get the medication covered (others can help with this, maybe) but there are a lot of programs out there that offer rebates, or some kind of financial help for medications while un-insured or under-insured. At this point, you either go on the insurance plan that your new job offers (which should be sooner than November) or you have to wait for open enrollment. 

Open enrollment has been in affect for many years now, so it shouldn't have been a surprise to you. 

I understand you were unable to afford it back in March/April, but health insurance is mandatory to have now and just like auto insurance, sometimes some things have to give in order to have it. 

I know this isn't good news to hear, and I'm sorry about that, but I can't see any way to help you. You missed the window. "
HealthInsurance,"It takes max 2 weeks for the changes to actually be sent to Anthem. Your plan will cancel in 2 weeks. It will not retro back to today when you called. "
HealthInsurance,"Ok. So you’re kind of in similar boat now anyways because short term medical usually doesn’t cover pre-existing. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;his shouldn't be a difficult fix.

One would think not.

One would dismayingly often be incorrect. Justice doesn't prevail as often as it should"
HealthInsurance,"Ah, I see.... that's a bummer. Your health advocate is right, the documentation in the medical records holds way more weight than the doctor's opinion letter.

Definitely submit that second level appeal. Exhaust your appeal options with the insurance company. A different person should review your second level appeal. If it's denied again (it probably will be) you STILL have options as a consumer.

You can file a complaint with your state's department of banking and insurance. I can look into it for you over my lunch break if you want. Insurance is in the business of making profits.... if they can find a way to avoid paying something, they will. My job has made me a huge supporter of the Medicare for All movement.

What state are you in?

What insurance company do you have?

Is it a self-funded policy through your employer? It should say somewhere on the card if it is.

What was the date range of your PT sessions?

If you get me this info, I can give you advice on where to go if your new appeal denies. :)"
HealthInsurance,"This is a legal issue with your divorce decree. Contact the lawyer you used for the divorce to submit a change petition for you. The fact health insurance itself works this way shouldn't be surprising. Dependents always are insured through the employee. "
HealthInsurance,"So here's the question - they can ""not count"" payments made by third party to my deductible and out of pocket. So they just...keep that money for their bottom line? What if the assistance was a generous friend or family member and the insurance company somehow found out. Would they also not count that?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;which would come out to almost no out of pocket a month

hmmm.... you mean your dad doesn't pay any per\-pay\-period contributions to cover mom, sis &amp; you under the school district plan? Because if you get reimbursable care, there are probably deductibles/copays/coinsurance /things you would pay ""out of pocket"" incorporated in the plan's benefit design."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;This is why it feels like a cheat

Rx manufacturers are ""cheating"" you, and your employer, and all the rest of us \- maybe even themselves. 

Ask an economist \- a good one \- their opinion of coupon programs \- for any kind of product. Their reply will include the term ""distortion"" a lot. Maybe even ""market distortion"". And they won't be using the term in a positive way."
HealthInsurance,"Your insurance isn’t bad. If you want “free” doctor appts you may pay more for your monthly premiums, ie: whether you use it or not. Your fiancé should be looking into her own insurance.

Where to start: The marketplace (state or federal depending on where you are) or ehealthinsurance.com to get an idea of what could be available to you. Keep in mind it’s not open enrollment and you currently have insurance so it doesn’t seem like you have a qualifying event that allows you to change right now."
HealthInsurance,"Have you seen the exact submitted CPT code for each claim to know that they were submitted identically? While they may be the same type of visit, the submission detail can widely affect the processing."
HealthInsurance,"I was surprised too. I will do that. I was told by the provider that the insurance contracted rate for us was the highest possible or ""sticker price"" and the rate they pay is a lower contracted rate. 

I cursorily looked at the EOB. Where would they explain this? They just show the adjustment for their claim, but no adjustment for our claim. "
HealthInsurance,Thank you for the suggestion! I'm looking at work from home options for sure. I've heard good things about medical billing
HealthInsurance,"UHC. That’s a very good question - I would think not because the provider is out of network so I pay the full cost out of pocket (she actually gives me a discount bc I couldn’t afford her otherwise - she is truly amazing, and I would not be here as I am without her, if I were even here at all). BUT every time I think I understand their polices, there’s something I’ve missed apparently - let alone when I try to figure out questions like this that they they haven’t answered. But thank you - this is an excellent question and I’ll ask when I can get through to a human again."
HealthInsurance,"You can stay on your father's insurance until you are 26. "
HealthInsurance,Did you switch to a HDHP?
HealthInsurance,Why can't you use a network provider?
HealthInsurance,"I can try to help. Whats on your mind?

To try to give general help - is there a specific doctor(s) you want to be able to see/continue to see? Check which of the plans they accept. What about hospitals? Is there one close to you that you know you would use for ER etc? Find out which plans they accept.

Do you have a good relationship with a doctor you see frequently? If so, ask for their input. Do they hate dealing with Aetna or UHC but are satisfied with blue cross? 

For the most part your experience on a medicaid plan shouldnt differ that much from one to the other since they all have to follow the same rules and are policed by the state. "
HealthInsurance,"This could a a mixture of what’s the problem. With the new insurance, if the GP copayment is only $15, you will definitely want to look at the EOB from your insurance. They will show you what they allowed and paid, as well as your portion. If those EOBs state you only owed $15 and the office has been billing out for an additional $25, then they owe you money. If you don’t have the EOBs, they should still be available online through the Aetna website. As far as the issues with thinking you’re uninsured. This does occasionally happen with insurances and is super annoying, but occasionally there is a disconnect with the insurance in the background where their systems glitch up and deny the claims for no coverage when you indeed are covered. But at the same time, these glitches can happen in office. So no idea who for sure is making the error, however as annoying as it is, just keep pestering the office about the bills you receive and they will eventually figure it out. Until they get paid by the insurance company, you won’t have to pay anything. Sorry you’re going through this mess!"
HealthInsurance,Slightly educated guess and simple answer. Yes it should be fine. When are your Kaiser benefits supposed to start?
HealthInsurance,"If you have health insurance available through your company you will not qualify for tax subsidies or credits towards the cost of a plan available through your states marketplace. However you're more than welcome to elect a plan offered through your state exchange, at a time when it's open enrollment or you have a qualifying life event. "
HealthInsurance,"You have an insurance card? Call them and don’t ask moms permission first. Sounds like your parents are hiding something. You can also ask your Dr who’s ins ppl can tell you exactly what plans cover what.

True, sometimes things aren’t covered, elective things usually. If this is a KIDNEY problem why would it not be covered? Is there more to it?"
HealthInsurance,Seriously.
HealthInsurance,This is what I love about this sub. We are all so friendly.
HealthInsurance,"Agreed. The providers should be able to tell you their contracted rate with each insurer and the insurer should be able to tell you their rate with each provider, it's just way too difficult (though not impossible) to do in advance of the service. In my experience it depends on who you happen to get on the phone with the provider and/or insurance company. It sounds like the OP eventually got the rate here when showing up to the appointment, but that doesn't help shopping around. "
HealthInsurance,$6350 for both
HealthInsurance,"medications often can, &amp; are, used to treat a variety of sometimes unrelated conditions. Among the more notorious examples: Viagra.....

so, to answer your title question, oh yeah"
HealthInsurance,"You may have up to 90 days to bring your account current. "
HealthInsurance,"You/She might be in a tough pickle given that we are outside of Open Enrollment (Nov. 1st - Dec. 15th). Has she had any life changing events recently? Lost health coverage, no longer employed, moved residence?

These are things that will qualify as a life event in order to shop for a new plan. An ACA plan that is. You can get a policy outside of open enrollment, but there is no guarantee that the policy will be full medical coverage that you can count on during a cancer fight. ACA is the only standard of quality that you can go by, and it is hard to get one outside of Open Enrollment."
HealthInsurance,"www.healthcare.gov but if she didn't sign up last fall she'll probably have to wait until this fall to get coverage.  Why didn't she sign up during Open Enrollment?  She might have qualified for a subsidy. "
HealthInsurance,yes
HealthInsurance,"It sounds like you have a Kaiser plan with three tiers of coverage?  Tier One is typically KP doctors, Tier 2 is PHCS networked docs, and Tier 3 is out of network. Even if it's not a Kaiser plan, it sounds like it works the same.

It also sounds like the Tier 2 doctors have a deductible applied to services.  You need to read your Summary of Benefits in *detail* the next time you go.  Ask which Tier your provider is in.  

Also, pay the bill according to the Explanation of Benefits you receive from the insurance company - not based on the bill from the provider."
HealthInsurance,"Did you appeal the decision on prescription coverage? If you supply evidence of alternative therapies or doses, your doctor can usually get it approved"
HealthInsurance,"If it's regular COBRA, as in they are 20+fulltime employees (pt time hrs can be added) then they have 44 days to send it to you. You're entitled to request anytime. Call 18664443272 for DOL national office that deals with COBRA. If you choose coverage in  those 60 days it should retroactively cover treatment."
HealthInsurance,My pediatrician is about 235 for a visit. Or at least that's what he charged for visiting my baby just after she was born and before they had her insurance info on file.
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, looks like my options are: aetna, Amerihealth Carits, Gateway, United and UPMC. Based on some pretty basic search results, seems like none of them are consumer favorites."
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"3 months according to this but I also see 2 months.

HealthInsurance,"Hmm... [this](http://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/HIVSTDVIRALHEPATITIS/HIVCARETREATMENT/CAREASSIST/Pages/FAQs.aspx) says you can make up to 500% FPL and qualify for ADAP in Oregon? That’s an income of $60k for a family of 1. Granted, I’m not familiar with Oregon’s program, just going off Google - but at least in my state (NC) you should qualify for ADAP, and I’d be surprised if we’re more generous than Oregon..."
HealthInsurance,"You might try reaching out to one of the major hospital systems in your area, they often have patient financial coordinators whose job it is to get people's care paid for one way or another, and they might have experience dealing with off the wall situations like yours."
HealthInsurance,"As long as you have enough subscribers on your payroll, you can get this taken care of quickly "
HealthInsurance,"all health coverage is ""local"" - your options &amp; their costs depend on a variety of factors specific to you; where you are (city, state), your expected income, how many people you want to cover, your health, etc.

As morictey notes, your changed employment situation should - if it occurred recently enough - give you a special enrollment window. Provide a few more details &amp; we can probably provide more specific help"
HealthInsurance,"An HSA (Health Savings Account) is a bank account. It must be opened at a bank or credit union that offers them. Your employer and your insurance company are not required to tell you how to open the banking account. The IRS Publication 969:
&gt; The notice must state that each eligible employee who, by the last day of February, establishes an HSA and notifies you that he or she has established an HSA will receive a comparable contribution to the HSA for the prior year. 

Basically your employer just has to say ""Hey, your health plan offers benefits if you have a Health Savings Account. If you have one, give us your bank account number and routing number and we'll direct deposit money to you.""

Looks like according to the IRS, you have to have already set up your HSA and notified your employer by the end of February to receive the previous year's contributions.

I received a 1095-C, so I'm guessing a 1095-B is similar in that they report the information about your health insurance coverage. If you have not received one from your employer, you need to request one to file with your taxes.

I've personally always loved having a High Deductible Health Plan. It's always worked best for me.

So Next Steps:

* Talk to your employer about your proof of health insurance coverage (1095-?). My tax document says a 1095-B comes from the *Issuer of the insurance or Sponsor of the plan providing coverage*. So your form may come from someone other than your employer

* You'll need to find a bank/credit union and open the HSA account yourself. You should receive a debit card (and checks if you ask) just like a regular checking account. 

**And finally, comment/post or feel free to send me a private message if you have more questions.** As long as you've had insurance without a lapse, you'll be safe from penalty. :)

~ Almost forgot, when you say not originally from the US, do you mean you're currently a citizen and have filed taxes before? Otherwise I highly suggest speaking with an accountant. My taxes were incorrect and I was audited just when I moved out of state. I couldn't fix it and had to get professional help. I think you mean you've been here a while now though and this insurance is just a new thing."
HealthInsurance,"I received one of my EOB's the other day and this is the breakdown.
Amount billed: $55896,
Plan Discounts: $0,
Your Plan Paid: $10565,
Then in the itemized responsibility to provider section:
Deductible: $613,
Copay: $0,
Coinsurance: $0,
Non Covered: $44716,
Amount you owe: $45330

I know I have a deductible of $3450 and most of that was being eaten up by the smaller bills I received as well. I anticipated paying up to $3450, the $45k in the amount I owe is what scares me. Hard to believe I get billed $2500 by the surgeon for the operation, but get charged $640 to pee in a cup.

HealthInsurance,"This happened on the stairs leading into/out of a NYC subway. I tried looking into it but from what I've read you really have to prove that it was the MTA's fault (i.e. Unsafe conditions, broken tiles, etc.) and that an accident where there's no obvious fault by the city is pretty hard to get a claim from them. "
HealthInsurance,"I don’t like to advertise on c2s, but there is a manufacturer coupon on this drug. "
HealthInsurance,I don't make much and Illinois for now
HealthInsurance,"Thanks!
Ill call ahead.
"
HealthInsurance,"If you are unemployed you might qualify for medicaid. I would check out healthcare.gov and you state's medicaid website to see if you qualify. Since it's not open enrollment and you are passed any special enrollment periods, you wouldn't be able to enroll in a traditional plan through healthcare.gov."
HealthInsurance,"I'm in Texas. Do you know where I can start looking? Every insurance I am familiar with says I am ineligible because the marketplace is currently closed... "
HealthInsurance,"what HiGloss said, plus while a dental plan may connect you with a network of dentists for whose services you pay ""below retail"" rates, the waiting periods individual dental plans typically impose for significant treatment - like extractions - plus your premium outlays can reduce or eliminate the value of those price discounts. Plus, dentists tend to be better businessmen than doctors, and more flexible in making  arrangements to enable you to pay their charges."
HealthInsurance,"Are you insured through your employer?  Is it a large (50+ employees) employer?  If so, you would be very likely costing your employer money and not the insurer.

If you have your coverage through the marketplace or a small employer, then go for it I guess.  There is no such thing as excessive use like you describe.  You may be treading into fraud territory though."
HealthInsurance,"It's high but it will be very difficult for you to ever reach it.  You have a co-pay for in network office visits and your deductible is $350.  Yes, you need to pay 10% coinsurance for anything else, but your co-insurance max is $2,150.  It looks like a good plan. By law they have to give you a max out of pocket.  It's just a fail safe should you get hit by a bus or need very expensive medications."
HealthInsurance,"Without looking at your policy, it is impossible to say 100%. However, IF it is an ACA policy, either through group or individual, it is without a doubt covered as an emergency."
HealthInsurance,"Should I ask my mother to unlist me on her plan before my birthday comes up again? Just to avoid a potential audit of this situation? Any less trouble this causes the better, at this point..."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Yes, thank you, that helps a lot!"
HealthInsurance,"I don't see how that much could be allocated to the dependent. The APTC is based the second lowest cost silver plan (SLCSP) in the area. If you're separating the tax households you'll have to recalculate the SLCSP for each household. The one on the joint 1095-A they were issued is now incorrect. I don't think there's an area out there that approaches $10k for the dependent's coverage alone so this is likely closer to $4k in APTC that can be allocated(guessing). See pages 12-13 of the form you linked and check out [this tool here](https://www.healthcare.gov/tax-tool/#/premium-tax-credit)

So there's still an advantage to doing this, but not as much they're trying to claim. That's just my interpretation of the situation, I'll be interested in what others have to say. "
HealthInsurance,"Dropped by for a gild because it turns out we do have a national (or the rep called it 'open-access' plan) and I can continue to visit the same doctors.

This answer was a life saver! Being able to continue receiving care out-of-state is a big help, keeping the doctors I'm comfortable with is a huge plus!

I had never heard of 'national' plans or anything of the sort, so again... thank you so much for your help!"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, it's one of those things where the client's tax professional and I were thinking this sounds too good to be true.

The dependent got an employer plan for 2018 so it became a moot point for this year."
HealthInsurance,"I don't have the quote in writing but I have the voicemail they left with the quote. The provider was in network. Insurance said that all they would have told whoever called was that the deductible must be met first and then they cover 90%. They would not have given any price point for a quote. Even if I had met the deductible, which I haven't, 90% doesn't make it $38. "
HealthInsurance,"You need to call their benefits administrator to try to speed it up, in my case I got the COBRA letter because of a different qualifying event. The requirements though are your employer has 30 days to tell the insurance company and the insurance company has 14 days to tell you, so it could be quite a while."
HealthInsurance,"You can try and put in a quality of service complaint. If you were only seen by the triage nurse and never had an actual visit with an MD, it may nullify the services if the insurance sides with you (and they may, given they'll have to pay for any fees above your copay). It may be worth it to call your insurance company and ask how to report fraud (either through them or the state) as far as where to start. Good luck!"
HealthInsurance,"Yes.  My employment was terminated on 3/9, but my ex employer is paying for Cobra through April and May."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for your breakdown. I definitely know which plan I'm on, and I've rung my insurer and they say there is no HSA with them under my name. 
No amount has been specified by me, all of the money is employer contributed. The reason I'm quoting Publication 969 is because it's the IRS rules on HDHP and HSAs, and quite relevant to my situation.
You are right though, the info on my 1095B is not the most important thing right now.

Why are you recommending I not PM anyone?

Again, thanks for taking the time to help me with this.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, I thought that I could *cancel* health insurance whenever I want, I just can't enroll outside of the specific times."
HealthInsurance,"My school does offer an insurance plan, but there's no way I could afford it. I'll definitely look into what they offer at my health center for now, but is their any way I can get insurance if my parents don't claim me? Or will I still technically be a dependent?"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks. I guess we just need to wait and see what that plan offers and then decide. "
HealthInsurance,How long has it been since you paid? I would call back and raise hell - ask to speak to a manager.  It's worth a shot. :(
HealthInsurance,"Right on.  Contribute what you can to it- if you're not a heavy utilizer of healthcare, its a good way to take a little back from uncle sam."
HealthInsurance,what would your non-employer-provided ACA coverage cost without subsidies?
HealthInsurance,Do you have a regional HMO plan?  There are several carriers that offer national HMOs and national PPO networks - don't assume yours is regional unless you know.  There might be docs in your network near where you are in school.
HealthInsurance,Get it in writing to further calm nerves and thoughts. :)
HealthInsurance,"PAs take time. Faxes fail. Your best bet is to call your PC's office and have them fax again. Call the insurance to make sure they got it and ask if they can expedite due to medical necessity. Going to urgent care clinics daily isn't going to do anything to ""threaten"" the insurance. That's not how things work. And by doing so you risk them rejecting the claims and having to pay the full cost out of pocket.


Source: I work in a PCP office and have done thousands of PAs over the years and our fax machine is used pretty much constantly and there are lots of errors and times things just don't go through."
HealthInsurance,"Are your parents not supportive of gender reassignment? They could be stonewalling you until you ""change your mind."""
HealthInsurance,"&gt; They already appealed once but were denied and are trying again.

&gt; Unfortunately I do not know more about the process as I am posting this without their knowledge

Hmmm... yeah, absent more specifics on the response they received regarding their appeal it's hard to say what the best next steps for you/your folks might be
"
HealthInsurance,"how long did it take for your empolyer to send this information? Are they required to provide this information within a certain time period? I am losing coverage on May 1st and I've been checking the mail everyday but so far nothing has been sent. Did you have any lapses in coverage? "
HealthInsurance,"Emergency room bills are usually in the thousands of dollars. If $100 is all you got away with, I'd rejoice lol. "
HealthInsurance,"Find out specifically what code was billed that generated the $100 copay. If it was a minimal code that covers non-physician treatment, then you owe the copay. If it was a code that covers physician treatment, then call the hospital billing department to dispute the bill, call your insurance company to get it on record what happened. 

However, you did go to the ER. You were seen and triaged. Staff does need to get paid. $100 copay is not that bad to find out that you do not have an infection and don't need medications."
HealthInsurance,"I have to agree, isn't every country but USA socialized medicine? I wouldn't even know where to start with this question from an AUS person. Sorry OP!"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah but when they say go ahead, use this doctor, it’s ok, and then the bill says “no it’s not ok” what would have been in the EOB that would have saved me?"
HealthInsurance,"I think I’m misunderstanding something. I have private small group insurance with our company, I intended to switch to a different private insurance. I was never involving healthcare.gov. I was told I don’t qualify for their assistance. "
HealthInsurance,"I think my concern is that I've had a few persistent health issues that I'm worried my prevent me from renewing my coverage or I could have something big come up and be screwed trying to rerenew.

I suppose the short term is really my only option then? How expensive are the private major plans?"
HealthInsurance,www.healthcare.gov
HealthInsurance,"Short term plans aren't scams, necessarily, but they will definitely not cover any pre-existing conditions, and they won't get you out of paying the tax penalty for 2018."
HealthInsurance,Yeah college is expensive.
HealthInsurance,UHC wont pay. They will tell the providers to go appeal the timely filing with Aetna.
HealthInsurance,"You really need to understand your insurance.  PCP just refers to your primary car physician.  In some plans you MUST go to your PCP in order to obtain coverage and need to get a referral before going to any specialist in order for it to be covered.   In other plans you can go to any doctor or specialist that is on their in-network or their Prefered provider list without the need for a referral.  You need to check your plan documents, or call your insurance company to find out which type of plan you have.  No one here can tell you which you have based on the information in your post.

Also, some plans allow your PCP to refer you to an out of network provider and will cover it as in network, but most will not or might only consider it in very limited circumstances.  If they don't consider it in-network then there is usually a separate out-of-network deductible to be satisfied even if you get a referral to that doctor.

In every plan I've been involved with you can change your PCP at any time but will be limited to the primary care doctors on the in-network PCP list for your specific plan.  You can find this information on their website but might need to call the insurance company's customer service to make the change.  I'd recommend calling the doctor's office to see if they are accepting new patients and how long the wait is to get an appointment (or even actually making the appointment) before calling the insurance company to make the official change."
HealthInsurance,"We tried this. It was a ridiculous deductible (?) Total.  It was like 12K "
HealthInsurance,"I believe it was based off of the number I provided when they asked my expected 2018 income, and I entered ~54k. This was before filing my 2017 taxes, so I don't think they would have my last year income to base it off of.

Household size of 4, plan only covers one of my daughters and me. Probably why it's so low. It is a pretty bare bones bronze plan, but we don't use it often. "
HealthInsurance,Thanks obama
HealthInsurance,"I dunno, when I called they claimed they hadn't received anything from my doc, then I made the threat, then an hour later I got a call from my doc (i hadnt even called them yet) that insurance responded and wanted me to try a different med first... wasn't the response I wanted, but it seems like the threat got some gears turning over there, as I doubt my doctor just happened to fax it over as soon as the first call was over, insurance got it, processed it, and got back to my doctor in under an hour"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Having a HDHP definitely makes you think more about the out of pocket cost for something. Unfortunately that’s not exactly information that’s readily available. "
HealthInsurance,"If they don't have a grace period or reinstatement policy, then you most likely don't have any options with them. "
HealthInsurance,"That is ridiculous that they won’t take into account that another insurance paid primary. I work for a different company and they allow 2 years from the date of service for a claim to be paid if it was first received by a different insurance. If the dated EOB from UHC is within 120 days from when Aetna received the claim, they should be adjusting it. But, unfortunately this is one of the parts of insurance that makes people crazy, is that just because it’s logical does not mean that’s their policy. I would try calling again, and if they still deny it then maybe the provider can appeal."
HealthInsurance,"Make sure you are clear with the hospital which plan the baby should be on. If hospital submits the newborn claim to mom's insurance, the newborn maybe added temporary to the mom's. There are usually rules/laws about automatic 4 or 30 day coverage. This few day coverage may result in you paying more for the newborn depending on both plans benefits. "
HealthInsurance,Thanks!  I am going to check and see if I am eligible for CHIP (I still have residency in Michigan).  I wonder if anyone has experience with surrogacy here as well.  That would be very helpful
HealthInsurance,"There really isn’t a specific thing I could link. It’s policy driven and is as unique as amounts of copays, deductible, etc.  The only way to know for sure is to check with the insurance company."
HealthInsurance,"Is the $7,150 out of pocket max excessive?"
HealthInsurance,"Hi all,

I ended up getting my prograf with a manufacturer coupon so thank you for that.

I spoke with a supervisor at Social Security and he confirmed I am not eligible to re-enroll in Medicare Part B because of cessation of disability. My Medicare Part A is set to terminate August 31 2018 due to the same reason (that's the earliest date possible they told me) 

My question is: Where can I get insurance if I'm not entitled to Part B but my Part A won't terminate until August? Has anyone heard of this situation before? 

I've spoke to a Blue Cross and United Healthcare and they are telling me I have to go through NY state of health. I'm in the process of filing an appeal with them because i need outpatient and prescription insurance or I'm going to lose my kidney.

Thanks again everyone this sub has been very helpful so far. "
HealthInsurance,"sounds like you 

a) have multiple plan options through your employer but 

b) have not done a total cost of coverage analysis of your options to determine which one  offers the best economic value  for you.

here's [an illustration of how to guesstimate and compare total cost of coverage for each of your options](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif)"
HealthInsurance,"Hi brli,

I called the Covered CA service center today to cancel my coverage after the end of this month, since I'll be going on my employer's plan after May 1.

They told me I shouldn't have to pay back the subsidy during tax time next year, since for the months where I was unemployed, I did in fact need the assistance. So it's essentially month-to-month.

Hopefully that's correct (who knows). But I guess I'll find out when I do my taxes next year.

Good luck to you, and hope you find your dream job."
HealthInsurance,"With ACA there is no pre-exisiting rule, this was one of the major, MAJOR ""selling"" points of the ACA act. I, personally, didn't have health insurance for about 18 years due to self employment and pre-existing, but with ACA, I have been insured for the past 4 years, and I thank god everyday because without it, I would have died in 2016 from Acute Liver Cirrhosis. 

Not sure why you don't have insurance right now, but if you can qualify to apply with a life changing event, go to healthcare.gov and check out the policies. Get a plan and start getting treated for your issues. All of your problems can, and will, be treated with an insurance from the ACA, there is no such thing as pre-exisiting at this point. 

Get it now, before ACA changes due to politics. "
HealthInsurance,Did this ever get resolved?
HealthInsurance,"If they aren’t willing to talk to you while being recorded wouldn’t that look bad on their end if someone took them to court? 

If they won’t let you record, ask them to talk really slowly so you can write down every word they say!"
HealthInsurance,"I actually have to disagree with you, I used to have an OB/GYN as a client, and we billed out the global code that covered all prenatal, 2 US, and the delivery (vaginal, no complications) and they would get paid anywhere from $1500-$2500. A little bit more if it was C-section. 

$2200 is their normal and customary fee and that's going to be all they will cover. It's up to your OON midwife to either accept that as payment in full, or bill you for the remaining balance. "
HealthInsurance,"Is there any way to ask your employer for 15-30 mins less than what you've been doing? Even if you can just clock out early, but stay for the shift, working for free for 15 mins to qualify for Medicaid would be well worth it, IMO. 

Then, get your two paycheck stubs, turn them in, get back on plan, you'll only be without insurance for a month. "
HealthInsurance,"She doesn’t need insurance coverage this year. Once she ages out of your policy, it’s a qualifying life event and she will be able to enroll at work outside of the open enrollment period. 

Source: happened to me 5 years ago. "
HealthInsurance,I don't think you will qualify for whatever tax credits you have now and will have to pay the full cost of the ACA plan yourself. Will that be less expensive than your employers plan?
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Let's not pretend the ACA is good for anyone but people who don't have to pay much or anything at all.

ok, but while we're not pretending, let's not pretend AHIP was responsible for a big portion of the law's framework"
HealthInsurance,Pretty much yeah or pay out of pocket for the surgery
HealthInsurance,"Okay, I guess I understand. What I don't understand is how a plan can exclude something so widely as ""sleep disorders"" \-\- any provider I've talked to acts like I'm an alien for saying this and/or doesn't believe me. I actually wound up seeing a sleep specialist on their plan because I looked him up through their website, and then they denied the 7K claim \(Mayo and their over enthusiastic testing methods\) several months later... luckily I got it down to 1K after working with their financial assistance department, but it's still a bill I can't pay. Apparently he was on the plan because he's also a pulmonologist, but I shouldn't be able to search for ""sleep specialists"" at all if that's the case. : /"
HealthInsurance,"Not really.  Some do, some don't . "
HealthInsurance,"Also, even if the only care you had was a verbal direction, that is a billed code, an ER evaluation, and can be SOOOOOO much more than just $100. Not to mention to room you were in (even if nothing was used but the paper on the bed)."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;My insurance is billing me for out\-of\-network services.

No, it's not.

People/care\-providing entities bill you. Your insurer pays some portion of your treatment charges \- or not.

Your insurer treats some charges as in\-network, some as out\-of\-network, &amp; calculates its payments accordingly.

Their determination regarding your air amublance transportation sucks,  of course.

You need to appeal your insurer's idiotic determination that your ER ride was out\-of\-network. Make them do their jobs."
HealthInsurance,Thank you!
HealthInsurance,"We already paid the bill, figured $900 was a cheap lesson learned in the grand scheme of things. "
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,good bot?
HealthInsurance,"Short answer is ""yes"" - but we need some more  info.

you've covered a bunch of pertinent factors. Help us with your anticipated annual income, age(s), and maybe a city where you'll settle, &amp; we can give your more actionable replies."
HealthInsurance,"1 &amp; 2) baby is covered under mom’s plan while they are in the hospital, just like they were enrolled in mom’s plan. Once the baby comes home baby can move to dads plan and will be covered for all future expenses. 

3) the only way that coordination of benefits would work is if both mom and dad added baby to their plans. Of course this means added premium, which typically will out pay the extra benefits the parents will get to pay for out of pocket costs. 

Note: once the baby is born you have 30 days the enroll the baby... this applies to both the mom and dad plan. If you do not enroll the baby within 30 days then the birth will still be covered under mom’s plan, but nothing after the birth will be covered. "
HealthInsurance,"Based on Houston, TX (I don't know where she lives), there are 34 different plans available to her, she's eligible for up to a $634 subsidy monthly and premiums range from $0 for an HMO (with her subsidy) to $689 a month.  The premiums change according to which plan she chooses.  She could choose a silver plan for $201 a month with a $0 deductible, $30/$80 co-pays for office visits and $35/$85/50% RX coverage. 

When you shop her in the fall you'll want to look very closely at plans and enter her annual income so they give you her estimated monthly subsidy (assuming the law doesn't change).

In my area a doc will charge upwards of $200 retail (with no insurance) for an office visit.  With insurance it's like $80.  Labs are outrageous without insurance. It's hard to guesstimate costs for RX without the specific RX but make sure you are looking at the manufacturer's website for a co-pay card, not just GoodRX."
HealthInsurance,"It's going to be somewhere in between impossible and requiring more time than it's worth to get an actual price out of anyone. Even then you'll still have to wait until your insurance company processes the claim so that you find out how much of a discount you're getting. The discount isn't a percentage off the total cost either, so let's say you call quest and they say they bill $250 for the blood work and your doctor's office bills $400. Well, if quest negotiated $200 for that service and the doctor's office negotiated $150, then even though the pre-reduction price was less at quest, you would have been better off going through your doctor's office. The doctor's office probably doesn't even know what the discounted rate is (at least not the front office folks that you can actually speak with) and good luck getting the insurance company to tell you what the negotiated rate is with each provider. As johntallen3 mentioned, this is a problem with our current system in that pricing is opaque and doesn't allow for consumers such as yourself to shop around (which means higher prices as there's little incentive for medical providers to compete based on price)."
HealthInsurance,"You don't apply at all right now if you don't qualify for a special enrollment period ([check here to see if you do](https://www.healthcare.gov/screener/)). 

If you're losing coverage - maybe from a parent's plan, or school, etc - you may qualify. If so, shop at the federal exchange, or via an site like [HealthSherpa](https://www.healthsherpa.com)"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,Excellent suggestion. Thank you! I will get in touch with the two companies I have as an option.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;...thus the tax credits have been taken away and the monthly premium is back to $2k\+ a month.

did you/mom obtain something documenting when &amp; how this happened?"
HealthInsurance,"I work in the healthcare industry, particularly in the insurance and financial aid department. From experience this is what MediShare does for patients. You pay into it and you only get back if you get really sick. They will not pay for regular doctor check ups or medications. They normally won't pay for preventable things. It basically acts as a catastrophic plan that pays for when you get really ill, but even then some things aren't covered. So basically a bunch of people pool their money together and based on the illness they decide to use that pooled money or not. Also, with that plan you must receive a bill and then submit it to MediShare to get it paid. So if they don't approve it you'll end up having a bill you'll need to pay before it going to collections. Good thing is that it is approved by the ACA so you won't get charged a penalty.

Since both of you lost your jobs and have a baby I'd reccomend applying for medicaid for your child. I don't know what state you live in but if you live in a state that expanded medicaid then you might also be able to get medicaid until you find a new job. 

Hope that helps. "
HealthInsurance,"all health coverage is ""local""; your options, and their costs, depend on a variety of factors specific to the person(s) covered - physical location (city, state), expected income, age, general health status, etc. 

In that sense, there's no ""national/country-wide insurance"" to be compared against. "
HealthInsurance,"I agree that the SLCSP is definitely wrong and their scenario falls into one of the examples in the instructions for form 8962 (as you mentioned, [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8962.pdf) on the top left of page 13) where they need to either request a corrected 1095a or calculate it themselves via the SCLSP tool. That said, I'm not sure that this prevents them from allocating more all of the APTC to the dependent. I initially agreed with you that it makes sense that the allocation could only limited to the actual cost of the plan or the second lowest cost silver plan, but I can't find anywhere in the allocation rules that suggest that there are any limits as to how the APTC can be limited between the two tax households (this would be Allocation Situation 4. Other situations where a policy is
shared between two tax families on page 18 [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8962.pdf)).

edit: In this case the daughter received more than she was eligible for (by far), but I don't know that there are any limits on the allocation (at least not that I can find!)."
HealthInsurance,Also - If he's recently lost coverage (thru his mom's plan) he'll be eligible for a special enrollment on www.healthcare.gov If he has no income it's possible he'll get a subsidy to pay for it.
HealthInsurance,Do you have another job lined up?
HealthInsurance,"Your edit is what you want to do. They will not cover any services that occurred before the start date of the policy, and ir is too late to get a healthcare.gov policy for April 1st. Cobra is the way to go if you need healthcare in April."
HealthInsurance,See if your prescribing doctor can get in contact with your insurance provider to allow you to use the brand name medication instead of the generic.  I have had friends who had this happen.
HealthInsurance,"1. It is true you have no say in the destination of the helicopter (even ambulances, if that were the case.) That's why there are policies put into place where the hospital where you went to contacts your insurance company and gets authorization to treat you. Now, if they don't have that information at the time, they could still get a retro-authorization and your insurance should process the claims as a medical emergency. (You didn't say WHO was billing you, just that you were getting bills)

2. Yes, there are many patient advocacy companies out there and even here on this subreddit and on /r/Insurance subreddit, including myself. You can google for a company or find other Redditors that are tagged as Patient Advocates (I'm tagged as that on /r/Insurance, but haven't been able to figure out how to get tagged on this subreddit. 

Worse case scenario, if you're stuck with bills, you would be able to get a patient advocate to help you negotiate the bills to a lesser amount and even with payment plan options. 

Good luck!"
HealthInsurance,Thank you!
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the resource. I'll be looking into this. "
HealthInsurance,"I currently use the plan in multiple states across the country. I understand the plan and how it works. It's a great plan - no deductible, low copays, don't need referrals to see specialists. I'm just looking for some info about which companies might offer national plans and some data points in regards to how much people usually pay for them. "
HealthInsurance,"COLD HARD FACT INCOMING: I don't think your life is at risk as much as you want what you want when you want it and don't have the patience to wait until you are in control of your own life.

Buy your own health insurance, your parents shouldn't have to be involved in any of this. IMO if you can't handle that you can't handle whatever else your trying to do."
HealthInsurance,How much a doctor's visit should cost
HealthInsurance,It's 102%
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  (~80/mo to cover me and my kids after subsidies).

Are the subsidies properly computed based on your current salary or are they based on prior year income?  Unless they are based on your current anticipated income for 2018 you are going to owe the government the difference when you file your 2018 tax return.  

The premium subsidy is not a final number.  It is an advance against a premium tax credit that is computed with your annual tax return.  When you file the tax return if the computed credit is more than the subsidy you received during the year then you get the difference refunded from the government.  But if the final credit is less than the subsidy you received during the year you will owe the difference back to the IRS."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for replying! I'm beginning to realize the trick is to choose a plan that your doctor uses, but I actually haven't been to a doctor in some time. I guess the pertinent question is how does one vett for a new medical professional to use with MA? "
HealthInsurance,"If you can afford it, I would pay the $107 out of pocket and save the HSA funds. They carry over every year and you never know when you will need to cover a very large bill (ER, surgery, etc.). "
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"""Health insurers can no longer charge more or deny coverage to you or your child because of a pre-existing health condition like asthma, diabetes, or cancer. They cannot limit benefits for that condition either. Once you have insurance, they can't refuse to cover treatment for your pre-existing condition."" https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-aca/pre-existing-conditions/index.html

Go get insurance and get help."
HealthInsurance,"They limit how much you can put in each year because those funds aren't taxed. They do not limit the overall total because they want to encourage you to save. You can use the funds for any approved medical expense as detailed by the irs. Doesn't matter if it's in or out of network.  HSA Bank is a great resource to learn more about Health Savings Accounts and how to use them. "
HealthInsurance,"Oh no. I’m so sorry this happened to you. 

Air ambulance services choose to be out of network specifically to charge you all that extra money. They refuse to join and I’ve seen articles that allege they make something like 700% profit. It’s disgusting and needs to be regulated. Honestly there needs to be a law against it. You don’t have a choice but you’re gonna owe the bill. 

Your best bet is to negotiate what you owe the providers. Your insurance isn’t going to pay more than they’d pay for an in network service. They’d be shooting themselves in the foot if anyone ever found out. 

Again, I’m really sorry. Ask the providers for payment plans, discounts, anything. 

"
HealthInsurance,"Ok, depending on your state you'll probably have to go to the exchange: www.healthcare.gov

I'd imagine your cost is going to go up pretty dramatically. :("
HealthInsurance,"Basically, yes.  I'm paying my 90 day supply copay and only getting a 30 day supply.  If I was only paying the copay for the 30 day supply, it would be fine.  Annoying, but fine.  The prescriptions SHOULD be for 90 days, but I am only being sent 30 days worth.  "
HealthInsurance,"(Sorry if any of this is confusing. I'm doing my best, but often healthcare vocabulary just fucking eludes me.)"
HealthInsurance,"You’ll pay 101% of the premium (depending on your insurance this can be very expensive but I’m sure it’s cheaper than paying for a delivery out of pocket). Your coverage does not change at all. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks! Helpful! "
HealthInsurance,"My daughter has Anthem. We've never had an issue like this, and we've used the insurance often (my son is a T1 diabetic that had a heart problem as well, we've seen many many doctors and nothing like this has ever came about). 

How could I go about looking into that? I've double checked all the fine print on our insurance and it covers any mental health care needed for autism, it just seems like the ""play therapy"" isn't something they consider a treatment or a legitimate way to give care."
HealthInsurance,"The medical profession runs entirely on fax, also lawyers. Its cobsidered the most secure way to send documents. A lot of times its an electronic fax, but fax nonetheless."
HealthInsurance,"Well, there is also the ""Go Fund Me"" incentive for them to get it wrong, though I hate to accuse.  I wish the reporter had followed up on that ""insurance doesn't cover"", but it's a small town tv station."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I looked up a specialist on Aetna's website, and got a result as being ""in-network""

A clinician's network status is *plan* - rather than insurer - specific. In other words, Dr. Smith may be in-network for Aetna plan A, but out-of-network for plan B."
HealthInsurance,"SO as long as I have the high-deductible insurance, I don't lose/pay for maintaining the HSA? Can I still use the Payflex Mastercard as a normal debit card such as buying fast food or online purchases or is it only limited to medical purposes?"
HealthInsurance,"Exactly this. While a doctors office can see your benefits, they aren’t perfect and you have to know your benefit and make sure it’s applying correctly."
HealthInsurance,"Thats a complex answer. Just find a new doctor if you can. "
HealthInsurance,"During the prior authorization process the doctor has to do. "
HealthInsurance,Doctor
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"I'll try that. I just feel like this would be so easy if I could just get rid of Medicare immediately. I don't understand why I can't just opt out without having to wait until august. "
HealthInsurance,South Dakota
HealthInsurance,"Actually, yes. If they find out that the claims were paid in error as you should not be eligible on your mother's plan the day you hit 26 years old. So, either they have the wrong date of birth for you (which is very possible), or you're possibly listed as a spouse on your mom's plan? I wouldn't even know where or how to begin to advise you on this, because any truth seeking that you look into with your mother's health insurance plan will result in them fixing the mistake and then re-processing every single claim that you've had with them since you turned 26 and reversing the payments on those claims, making you responsible. 

At this point, if I were you, I would simply go to healthcare.gov and find my own health insurance plan. "
HealthInsurance,"Unless I did something wrong but it was either 6k - 12K 
"
HealthInsurance,Thanks for the heads up. I'll try to take a look at the policy if we can get it from our carrier. That does seem like a good place to start.
HealthInsurance,"You are offered multiple plans with different deductibles.  It sounds like you're repeating things that you've heard from other people rather than actually looking at the plans that are available on the exchange.  For a single coverage in Texas, the deductible can be anywhere from $0 to $7,350 depending on which plan is selected.  Not to mention, in the silver, gold, and platinum tier, many plans have copays which are before deductibles so the deductible wouldn't apply.  Furthermore, her income of less than $30k a year puts her at below 250% FPL which means she would qualify for further cost sharing reduction benefits that can lower deductibles on silver plans.  I don't know where your mom is but if she's in the Houston area, at her income and age, the Molina Marketplace Silver Plan - HMO with a $0 deductible, $30 copays for PCP, $80 for specialists, $35 for generic drugs is $201 a month.  But, again, she cannot enroll in this plan because she missed open enrollment.  

The only other option for her outside of open enrollment would be a short term plan which will not cover any of her pre-existing conditions (high blood pressure and hyperthyroidism).  She will have to wait until open enrollment in order to get health insurance that will cover her pre-existing conditions.  This is what happens when you roll the dice, though.    "

HealthInsurance,"I was up for a new refill in January.  I got it from the doctor, for a quantity of 30 which my doctor mistakenly said was a 90 day supply.  A quantity of 30 is actually only a 30 day supply, so I asked for them to send a new refill with the correct quantity for a 90 day supply, but they did not.  The new refill was for the same quantity.  "

So she has no coverage currently, and hasn't lost coverage in the past month or so.

HealthInsurance,"There is definitely travel insurance tailored specifically to international students. I know IMG Global, United Healthcare, Geo Blue (Blue Cross/Blue Shield) all offer some kind of travel policy. There are lots of other options out there. realanceps idea to check with the school where your spouse will be studying at is a good first idea and then if that doesn't work maybe look at travel policies. Travel medical plans tend to have lots of exclusions so give the brochures/policies a good look over before you commit to anything. Usually your USA plan would at least cover her for emergencies abroad.

HealthInsurance,"Did you get an explanation of benefits from your insurance company? If so, what did it say?"
HealthInsurance,"State regulations suggest that he should notify the state about earning this income. It's unlikely to substantially increase the cost of his insurance, and even if it did, HIP monthly contributions are capped at $20/month per person for non-tobacco users and $30/month for tobacco users. As long as he sends documentation showing clearly that this is a temporary 3-day job, they should only apply the change for the current month, and it would only affect his HIP contribution for the current month. I would encourage him to make sure the state understands it is not an ongoing job.

HealthInsurance,Lol thank you!
HealthInsurance,You should be able to check network status on the insurances website. Look for provider lookup and put in the doctors name.  I doubt you'll get United to pay without some sort of processing or denial from Aetna. From what you've said they are both just wanting to stick you with the bill.
HealthInsurance,"Sorry I misread. If the first hospital did anything, even just a consultation, you will likely get 2 ER copays. You could talk to the insurance company after you get the bill/eob however if that hospital bills anything and your policy doesn’t exempt you from 2 copays for ER, then unfortunately you’ll get 2. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for your input... you are probably right. But am I wrong to think this is a bum deal? Part of the contract is that if you are admitted into the hospital from ER, then the copay is waived. But the first hospital would neither admit us, but nor would they send us home either. I don’t even know why they wouldn’t admit us either, but it sure seemed like it was because there was a children’s hospital nearby and they didn’t want to deal with it."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;curious if there were better options for international health insurance.

there's no 'generic' better option. Your optimal solution will depend on wheere your spouse will be going to school. That school will be a good source of suggestions, as will the US embassy for that country.

On the bright side, health care available where your spouse is headed is likely to be of comparable quality, and coverage for care almost certainly much less costly, than it is here"
HealthInsurance,"Good for you to try to plan this out. You have a few moving pieces to consider. Among them:


1) what sort of coverage do you have now?

2) will you have the option of continuing that coverage? If so, what are the terms of your continuation option - for example, how long do you have to make a choice?

3) when do you plan to move to Seattle?"

HealthInsurance,"1. It's illegal to bill you (in certain states, so this sounds applicable) if they are a Medicaid only clinic, as it's illegal to bill patients who qualify for Medicaid. Most free clinics are Medicaid based, where as they get most of their funds from Medicaid and have to follow sliding scale rules. 

2. Now that you have insurance, why are you calling around to get prices from clinics? You don't need to do that, as the prices of their visits will mean nothing to you since you have a health insuranc eplan that covers $55 per visit. Is there a deductible, if so, how much?

3. $155-$340 is within normal ranges for a new patient visit, IMO. Again though, if you find someone who is on your insurance plan, then you will only be responsible for any copays or co-insurance/deductible that is listed in your benefits. "
HealthInsurance,"Hi Everyone,

I just wanted to post an update.  I went to Quest today and the $994 amount I was quoted on the phone, once they ran my insurance, was reduced to an amount I may owe of $90.00.  So, it looks like with BCBS IL there is a 90% reduction of the sticker price.  It looks like I will have to pay the $90 due to the deductible, but it would have been really nice if they would have told me this over the phone.

However, they were able to give me this number before doing the blood draw at the lab, so if you're wondering about cost you're probably best going to the lab and if the estimated cost is too high, just back out before they draw the sample."
HealthInsurance,Fax?  You should tell your insurance company about this new technology called email...
HealthInsurance,"Sorry about that, I get paid every other Friday. The health I’m paying for through the employer is $468 a month. "
HealthInsurance,"The auto insurance is primary. Your health insurance won't pay until the auto insurance payments are exhausted. If the health insurance still doesn't pick up, call and ask if they would be willing to waive network requirement since it was an emergency and you didn't have input on the provider."
HealthInsurance,"all health coverage is ""local"" - your options &amp; their costs depend on a variety of factors specific to you; where you are (city, state), your expected income, how many people you want to cover, your health, etc. 

As morictey notes, your changed employment situation should give you a special enrollment window. Provide a few more details &amp; we can probably provide more specific help"
HealthInsurance,"""The secondary plan would only pay if the primary plan doesn't cover the treatment.""

This is incorrect. How a plan pays as secondary depends on that plans coordination as the second plan. It could be non-duplication or come out whole (cow). This could result in either nothing or a part of that might be paid depending on several factors. (oopm being met on the secondary plan being important) 

Sometimes the secondary plan WON'T cover a service if your primary denies.

I recommend calling your current insurance, which will be secondary if your daughter chooses an employer plan, and see if they can clarify how the coordination as secondary will work. 

Also before your daughter declines her insurance you will also want to check with your own human resources. Sometimes if a dependant is eligible for their own insurance through an employer, that dependant, your daughter, might not be able to stay on your insurance or you might have to pay a surcharge to keep her on your insurance. This means higher premiums for yourself.

"
HealthInsurance,"Clarify with your insurance if they are paying our of network benefits or if they are paying in network but that there is a noncovered amount. Emergency should be covered using your in network, however because the provider is out of network your plan might use a specific out of network reimbursement rate to get the allowable amount. Allowable being the max that the insurance will reimburse for a service. This can cause anything over that rate to be your responsibility.

If the out of network rate is enrp ask your insurance about balance billing for enrp. Some states don't allow this. "
HealthInsurance,"Talk to her HR- some time companies extend coverage for disabled adult children. Otherwise, depending on your state you may qualify for Medicaid expansion, which gives Medicaid to all low-income adults. You may also qualify for Medicaid on the basis of your cancer. Finally, you can get insurance through the Marketplace. if your parents still claim you as a dependent tben, depending on their income, you can get financial help paying your premiums. "
HealthInsurance,"Up to you. I still don’t think the coverage is all it’s cracked up to be... taking a quick look, the first thing that jumped out of me is that it only reimburses $100 per day for a doctors visit inpatient. What happens if you’re admitted to the general medicine service but need a specialist (or two or three) to see you? Also, I just saw that it only covers 12 prescription fills a year... oof. Your call whether the money you save is worth the risk the coverage won’t be adequate, though. "
HealthInsurance,"so if I get cancer, I lose coverage after 90 days? then what?
"
HealthInsurance,"wow 10 hours and nothing. start calling around. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes that's a qualifying life event. 

If you qualify for subsidies, they are taken out of your monthly payments from the start. You provide them your estimated yearly income. If, at the end of the year, your income is different from what you projected, any discrepancy will be rectified when you file your 2018 taxes. You'll either get a refund for having been owed a larger subsidy, or owe if you received too large of one. 

That said, either at 80k or 100k a year, you're unlikely to qualify for subsidies. If you drop down to only making 61,000 a year, your company probably won't be happy since they won't want a contractor that only works essentially part time. 

The reason your salary went up 20k from FTE to Contractor is that 20k is to compensate you for loss of benefits such as health insurance. "
HealthInsurance,"Medicaid. Apply ASAP. "
HealthInsurance,"I would call the provider and ask what the cash pay price would be for the tests without identifying yourself. You may also want to check on your insurance companies website if they have a cost breakdown of procedures for you to see so you can compare. I typically will ask for what billing/procedure codes will be used for anything I have done. Insurance is a scam.

And yes we need full transparency but we will never get it, there is to much money to be made. "

HealthInsurance,"
It’s pretty common for smaller offices/practices to delegate coding and billing to a random office staff person, rather than employ a trained coder/biller with proper education. Often, they’re guessing codes, based on past approvals. 

Since the office is being unhelpful, I would call Anthem yourself, explain the situation, and ask for guidance. They may be able to give you assistance or advice in getting the codes resubmitted. It will probably take several calls between your insurance and the office.

HealthInsurance,"If the reason for the transfer was emergent and because the first hospital didn’t have the ability to perform what needed to be done and the second hospital does, then the second hospital MIGHT be covered at the in network level. It might depend on the insurance company, but if that is the case, basically the insurance company might try to negotiate a lower allowed amount than the billed charge and based on whatever is fully allowed, the in network benefits would apply then (copay/deductible/coinsurance). But calling the insurance company is the best bet. "
HealthInsurance,"So he hates ACA and refuses to have insurance, he's well off and lives in TX... I'd say just let him pay for his own surgery then. I mean, realistically, there are no pre-existing conditions barring him from getting insurance, but that's due to the ACA. So if he's against that, then he can pay out of pocket. Seems like that's what he'd prefer."

HealthInsurance,"Simply put, doctors are having a really hard time getting patients to pay their share after the insurance company pays, so they are trying to get the patient to pay up front.

&gt; The game where the doctor over-bills insurance and then settles on a lesser amount is just the weird way our system works, right?

The game is ""the price is wrong"". The insurance company is thinking of a number.  That number changes all time, from plan to plan, and the doctor can ask for that number and get told that there's no guarantee that the number will be right.  And unlike the Price is Right, if the doctor guesses under that number, they lose.  So the doctor guesses a high number, say $250, the insurance company says ""Nope, our number for this patient is $128.50. We'll pay 80% of that.""  If the doctor is in network, then the company adds ""and the patient will pay the other 20% as coinsurance and you have to write off the rest.""

&gt; To have me on the hook for any balance from that game is absolutely insane.

You ARE on the hook for whatever coinsurance or deductible you agreed to in your policy.  Make sure you use in network doctors since then they're obligated to write off the excess charge, and that they use in network labs so they are obligated to write off the excess charges too."
HealthInsurance,"Yes the main issue is that they are losing access to a better health insurance plan and that his company has no reason to reinstate based on their protocol, they received no notification that their service was terminated (apparently it’s not required?). They already appealed once but were denied and are trying again. 

Unfortunately I do not know more about the process as I am posting this without their knowledge; just trying to see if I can help at all because they have repeatedly referred to this situation as a “living nightmare” on top everything else they have going on. It seems that the company has the control of the situation here and is perfectly fine with screwing them over based on policy’s and procedures. I know they have applied for separate health insurance so hopefully that works out but they will be losing out a plan that includes vision and dental."
HealthInsurance,"First off, kudos to you for providing all the necessary information for the sub to advise. Upvote.

Secondly, first commenter pretty much sums it up. Consider this - you have NO anticipated medical costs, unless you consider a default office visit at some point which for a primary will cost you &lt;$200.

In that light, your total financial exposure for any catastrophic event is the SAME for each plan ($4,000), except you are paying more per month for the same safety net of coverage and getting no HSA benefits.

Save money by enrolling in the HSA plan and rest easy knowing you have a savings account accruing to pay for the one-off encounter with the health system.

If you were so inclined and financially stable, consider contributing the difference in the monthly premium to your HSA. Remember that all the contributed HSA funds (yours or employer) roll over, follow you if you change jobs, and accrue interest. Also recall that if you so choose, HSA contributions can be changed at any time."

HealthInsurance,"That’s good, sounds like they are taking responsibility and you won’t have to pay. One time my hospital made a mistake when calling for a preauthorization for my surgery. They told the insurance it was inpatient when it was really going to be outpatient. For whatever reason, my insurance company didn’t require a preauthorization for an inpatient surgery so they just told the hospital not to worry about it. Then I get smacked with a $500 copay even though I’d already met my deductible for the year (and purposely tried to fit in the surgery before the new year because of that ��). A couple hours’ worth of phone calls later, we figured out that the copay was for lack of preauthorization and I got the hospital and insurance company to work it out between themselves. It’s ALWAYS worth calling. I had the money at the time and could have just paid the $500 but I’m glad I didn’t because it wasn’t my bill to pay. "
HealthInsurance,"Agree with this guy, or a sharing ministry that isn't strict on the religious requirements if that's not your thing.

Check the date on which you *received* your COBRA notice, note the date, and count off 60 days - that's your *election* window. Maybe walk it back 5 - 7 business days to give yourself some ""processing time"" margin....

Your low-cost ACA plan strategy also seems ok if you don't have chronic conditions that need regular clinical attention &amp; you can afford out-of-pocket spending for basics.

"
HealthInsurance,"They cannot kick you off for ""costing too much money"". 

They cannot limit the dollar amount of care that is received. 

They CAN increase your premiums, but NOT just yours, they would have to increase premiums across the board, which almost every insurance company that I've seen (and personally have had) have done every year since ACA was formed. Having said that, your premium should only increase upon the anniversary of the initial enrollment. "

HealthInsurance,"Jackasher is pretty smart and spot on with what he said, and I'm an agent here in Texas, so I'll shed some light on this. No matter what state you live in, a true ACA compliment plan is not available to purchase outside of open enrollment unless you have a qualifying life event, period, and like what Jackashr stated, the only options are either a temporary plan (they are never ACA compliant) or a sharing ministry that try to sell as a PPO and it's only ACA compliant because your exercising your religious freedom to  opt out of ObamaCare with IRS form 8965. Some of them also have affiliations with a PPO networks, but don't be fooled, they are NOT health insurance.  As far as PPO's go, they are not even available with a ACA compliant plan in Texas on an individual basis, period, they don't exist in Texas, it's HMO only, the only way to get a PPO plan is with a group, I'm not sure about any other state.  Open enrollment will start November 1st and run through December 15, for the most part, but check with where you live because different states had different open enrollment times last year.  I'm also willing to Guess that we are going to have a lot of new plans for next year that are also not aca-compliant because the tax fine is eliminated next year as this is the last year for receiving the tax fine for not having health insurance. My guess is next year we're going to have lots of companies coming out with under written policies next year just like we used to have before Obamacare, and they will not label these as true health insurance in order to avoid the laws, and they will also not cover everything like a true ACA plan well like pregnancy or mental health as an example. It's going to be very interesting to see what happens later this year that's for sure. "
HealthInsurance,"When an insurance claim is billed, we see procedure codes (what they did), and diagnosis codes (why they did it). There would likely be a diagnosis code added to the claim that would indicate tobacco use.

HealthInsurance,"&gt; I predict faxing records between doctors to remain a thing for the next few decades, at least.

I fear you are correct. :( I'm coming at it from a payer focused electronic document perspective. There are several initiatives trying to get at least prior-auth and attachments going. Adoption is an uphill battle, both ways, in quicksand and snow. Simultaneously. 

I know almost nothing about provider practice management software so I'm not pointing any fingers. Faxing is:
- easy
- secure (whether perceived or accurate is up to interpretation)
- cheap

That last one is the toughest to overcome.

I had heard in passing considerations for putting patient health records on distributed ledger technology, or even giving it to patients directly, via a phone app. I think the technology is there, but I'm biased. Provider business is saving lives, they have to be efficient and take no chances. I get it, I do. Frustrating though."

HealthInsurance,"Depending on your insurance, they may not cover the service if it is not medically necessary, so if your doctor is saying it was then that is something they should have discussed with the provider. Often these services require authorization prior to rendering the service. When you call the insurance company be sure to explain the circumstance and hopefully they will overturn their decision. The provider might also have to appeal the claim for payment. "
HealthInsurance,"It can take some time. Whatever coverage you elect would be retroactive, though, as long as you enroll within 60 days of receiving the notice. You will get a thick packet in the mail, can’t miss it. The 60-day clock starts then, and if/when you enroll it will take you all the way back to the day after you lost your coverage. Your coverage will remain the exact same (I believe you also maintain any progress toward meeting your deductible) but you will have to pay 101% of the premium (no employer subsidy). That’s the gist of it. When you get the letter, set a reminder in your calendar for a week or so before the 60 days is up, just in case time gets away from you. "

COBRA regs allow your employer a certain amount of time to send you COBRA paperwork and enrollment forms and there isn't a whole lot to be done about it.  You could check with your HR to see about getting enrollment direct from them (or the COBRA administrator, if applicable).  But you're not eligible to enroll until your coverage has terminated.

I don't know if there's any way to enroll in advance and I don't think COBRA allows for anticipation of termination.  Talk to your HR and talk with the hospital about your situation."

HealthInsurance,He took a big pay cut if you factor in taxes.
HealthInsurance,"IF you have a qualifying event you can get coverage on www.healthcare.gov mid-year.  if you haven't lost coverage or had a life changing event you will have to wait until the fall for coverage to begin January 1, 2018.  It's worth checking out the website. 

That being said, an ER is going to see you and then bill you later but expect the bill to be enormous, especially if you get an MRI with no insurance. Depending on your location, see if there are any low cost clinics available in your community."
HealthInsurance,"Sounds like you've got it covered. You may want to contact the previous employers insurance carrier at the point you're ""cancelling"" your COBRA coverage since your new employers insurance carrier may require proof of creditable coverage being cancelled before they consider you eligible.

However, you're spot on with the assumption that ending COBRA voluntarily will count as a qualifying event that makes you eligible to join your new employers plan outside of their initial waiting period. Since employers can't have waiting periods longer than 90 days, you will have exceeded whatever waiting period they have established. Best bet - call your new employers HR (or whoever handles their health insurance enrollment) and explain to them what you're up to. They'll let you know if you need the letter from your previous carrier.

Good luck and congrats on having a gracious ex-employer!"
HealthInsurance,Yep I did the same when you originally posted.  People r dumb.  Or woefully misinformed.
HealthInsurance,"It may be an option, and we can ask tomorrow when we go talk in person. Everything was presented as occupational therapy. My daughter needs physical therapy, but they don't offer that yet - that's why the OT was specifically mentioned. I requested the claims be either fixed or resubmitted, the manager agreed to do so, then appealed. Something just seems off with the whole situation honestly."
HealthInsurance,"I had a qualifying life event when I was last shopping, so I didn’t run across that obstacle. I’m sure there’s a way you can get health insurance since you don’t have it. Otherwise your only qualifying life event would be losing enough income! Not fun. "
HealthInsurance,"If you cancel insurance through your employer, then you're going to be penalized next tax season. 

You cannot haggle the cash price with the HMO, however, you MAY be able to ""discuss""/haggle the price with the actual doctor's office office manager. Tell her/him that you can't afford what is being charged, your deductible is way too high, what price can they give you to pay as a cash patient, even though you have insurance, ask them to stop billing the insurance. However, that would prevent any dollar amount being applied to your deductible though, so you might care about that, while the doctor's office really shouldn't care about that at all, if what they say is true that the insurance discount is cheaper than their cash pay discount (I don't buy this, all of my client's cash price is ALWAYS cheaper than what insurance ""allows"" and applies to deductibles)"
HealthInsurance,"I can't speak on your company's behalf, but I get people reinstated all the time for non-payment. It's actually quite common to have happen. They might require you to pay your entire balance before reinstatement, and they'll probably only reinstate once or once per year."
HealthInsurance,Covered California should be able to provide this. You should call them and ask to speak to a supervisor since you've already tried to resolve this without one. Explain the situation and request to have a 3 way call done out to Medi-Cal with the supervisor on the line to get to the bottom of this. Good luck!
HealthInsurance,Hospital claims there was no response. Should I check with my insurance company to see what's taking so long or just wait it out? Thanks for your response.
HealthInsurance,Apply for ACA plan since your losing coverage you get to enroll but with no income you'll not get a tax credit so it will cost something. Maybe apply for state Medicaid. If your in the USA that is.
HealthInsurance,"You’re done on any parent’s plan once you turn 26. "
HealthInsurance,"Go to healthcare.gov, fill out all the information, and browse what is available to you."
HealthInsurance,Already planned. This November will probably see the highest turn out rates. Thank you!
HealthInsurance,"If your plan is being subsidized based on income figures you supplied when you got the plan, then at tax time next year it's possible you will owe back the subsidy value (in total or partial) based on your actual annual income. "
HealthInsurance,"I'm getting it. I wasn't entirely sure how deductibles work and the insurance guy I am working with told me.

Didn't know that it only applied to hospital or ER visits, so I am definitely getting it."
HealthInsurance,"healthcare.gov if you want a non-short term plan. "
HealthInsurance,"Did you call into the Marketplace? They are the worst when it comes to helpful advice. They are not agents. If you tell them that your mom makes 15K a year, they will tell you there is no tax credit for her, WITHOUT letting you know that just 1800 more on the application will give her a free plan with a super low deductible. They neglect to tell you very important things.
"
HealthInsurance,"Your Kaiser coverage would be primary as has been said (employee coverage is first), but even though your chiro is not in the Kaiser network, doesn't mean you don't have out-of-network benefits.  If your plan has out-of-network benefits, there may be part of the claim paid by Kaiser and then some amount left to be paid by your parents' plan as secondary.  That should be how the coordinate of benefits would work.

Also, you can stay on your parents' plan until you are 26, but the cost of covering you as a dependent still may not be worth it if you have good coverage with your employer."
HealthInsurance,"ONE more question lol: what's the deal if the doctor i choose is listed as taking new patients, on the enrollment page; but the receptionist claims differently? Do I just wait for UPMC to process my case? thanks for your time, btw."
HealthInsurance,Yes.
HealthInsurance,Thank you!!! This is great stuff
HealthInsurance,"The maximum you could pay out of pocket for any in network service during a plan year is currently $7150, as mandated by federal limits. Thus, your maximum out of pocket expenditure is (yearly premium) + (out of pocket max). The out of pocket max could be lower than $7150, but the trade off is generally a higher premium, which in a worst case scenario could cost you more actually. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"You would have to take the new jobs insurance and therefore ditching the old group insurance, even if the new insurance happens to be Aetna. The only thing you can *possibly do, a thing that I am not an expert on, is claim Cobra from your old job and have your deductibles and benefits carry forward. However, my intuition is telling me that if you are offered group insurance from a new employer while on Cobra, you will probably have to take the new insurance regardless. Not only that, but you probably are not going to like the premium with Cobra given that it is 100% of the premium, where you are now paying only 50% or less, due to your employer paying the rest.

The only other circumstance I know of that allows you to carry forward a deductible is changing the plan within your group, with the same company. 

Here's the deal, you need to put forward what you actually need to get done health care wise. If you have thousands of dollars worth of medical expenses left this year that Aetna can cover, you're best staying put (unless of course your new potential employer offers you a better plan). If you have absolutely nothing to worry about for the rest of the year minus unforeseen circumstances, take the new job and don't worry about it! Shopping for insurance is about risk and frugality. How much are you willing to risk to stay frugal? 
"
HealthInsurance,"What are your reasons for not wanting short term coverage? Do you have any ongoing health issues? If you don’t, then temporary insurance seems like a better option than buying on your own. Individual privately purchased plans are expensive. By this time you’ve already gone way past the 3 month threshold after which you’re supposed to pay a penalty, so unless you need super duper coverage because you need to see a specialist, or you do dangerous things that can get you hurt, temp might be the way to go. "
HealthInsurance,"Second time today someone has called me a guy �� I think I need a new handle! "
HealthInsurance,"Hmmm.

Mom &amp; dad are not correct. Health insurers \- not just BCBS \- simply stand to get in too much high\-profile trouble for doing shady stuff like your parents are concerned about. It's not that they're angels of virtue \- doing that kind of thing is not worth the risk.

At the same time, I'm not sure you have an adminisstrative path to changing coverage in the way you describe. You can't simply swap coverage mid\-year.

It seems like what you really need to do is document that whatever procedure you indicate MUST have is a\) NOT covered by  your current insurance and b\) clinically appropriate for your condition. It's relatively rare that there is a single clinical approach for any health condition, and rarer still that an insurer will not cover some portion of the costs of a procedure broadly recognised as effective by clinicians. Have you obtained a second opinion?

tl;dr double check &amp; document that BCBS doesn't cover the procedure you're focused on

t"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I currently have an insurance plan that works almost anywhere in the country

If by ""works"", you mean a hospital or clinic would recognize your coverage and so treat you without demanding cash up front, practically any individual policy will do the same for you. 


What the individual policy WON'T do -  and your employer coverage may not do for you either - is promise the most generous benefit payments for your treatment, especially non-emergency treatment, ""anywhere in the country"". Your ""anywhere' **emergency** treatment will ordinarily be covered. Non-emergency treatment - checkups for a condition that needs periodic followup care - will be another matter, dependent on the type of plan you're enrolled in - whether employer-sponsored, or non-group ACA coverage, or some form of Medicare coverage option."
HealthInsurance,"They're a broker, not an insurer.  I'd have to see an eob but I doubt they're on the up and up."
HealthInsurance,"It's quite simple. People will go without insurance before even attempting to do this though, unfortunately."
HealthInsurance,"#1 make sure the lab is IN NETWORK
#2 I can tell you that I've gotten an MRI and got the results immediately, well before the bill came in the mail
#3 Ask the lab if they will send it to insurance and then bill you or if they will require payment up front."
HealthInsurance,"Knowingly submitting incorrect codes is insurance fraud.  

You don’t say what insurance your daughter has, but in the US, knowingly submitting false claims to Medicare or Medicaid is a violation of the False Claims Act, and carries significant penalties. "
HealthInsurance,"OP, here's a [walkthru of a COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/)  that gets covered here frequently. You may want to review it, because while you may continue coverage via COBRA, you bear the ""true"" premium cost of your coverage \(plus a smidge\) \- which can be an eye\-popping figure."
HealthInsurance,"After some more digging, I actually agree with you. This seems to be a loophole that exists and they could take advantage of. They would lose the ability to claim the dependent's personal exemption of $4050, but the tax pro seemed to make them aware of this. I'd say they're in the clear. 

They could possibly get away with doing the same thing in 2018(I would guess they didn't change much and just let the similar plan/subsidy roll over into this year), but if they were my clients I'd probably advise them to update the household situation now. "
HealthInsurance,About how much does your Mom earn per year?  What county does she live in?
HealthInsurance,Over 60k.
HealthInsurance,"Let's simplify this.  1) If you hopped on your wife's  insurance AFTER  you enrolled into your companies plan, you're locked in for the plan year under your wife's insurance  unless you experience a life qualifying event. 2) Contrary to the previous comment, you do not have to have to open an HSA at your own bank or credit union.  If your company sponsors an HSA, you can simply utilize the same vendor.  If your company has a section 125 in place, they will simply take an amount, specified by you, pretax, out of your paycheck and deposit it to the HSA account for you to either save or spend on qualified medical expenses. 3) Talk to your employer and ask if you're on the plan .  If you're on your companies plan,  and they're making contributions, then the money is sitting around waiting for you.  If your employer doesn't have an answer for this, find another employer. 4) Pick up the phone and find out which plan you're on before you start worrying about 969's and 1095's a or b or c or whatever the fuck else.  5) don't pm anyone, talk to your employer and if they do t know what they're  talking about, ask for contact info for their  Benefits Broker because they're the ones behind the scenes knee deep in the healthcare world, your employer doesn't have time to wrap their heads around this "
HealthInsurance,"I didn’t mean to insinuate I would be committing insurance fraud. I don’t want to do anything wrong or illegal. 

To answer your question, my pharmacy said I can’t refill until July 1. "
HealthInsurance,Exactly this.
HealthInsurance,"Hi there. Let me start by saying that I think this particular issue is one of the many reasons on why we have such high medical costs in the USA. Medical providers are not held accountable in that they do not provide prices for any of their services. How hard is it to have a binder with all of their prices in it? What this does is create competition and transparency.

1: I would say the doctors office, usually. When it comes to Quest, you have zero negotiating power. What they say the price is, that's what it is going to be.

2: You should have the discounted rate in both instances since you are on a PPO (As long as you are in network). 

3: I recommend doing the test yourself through requestatest or walkinlabs. Hands down they will be cheaper, unless your insurance company is outright paying for everything. 

Having said that, after talking to both the lab the doctor's office uses, and Quest, you should contact the doctor's office again and ask them what the price is going to be with your PPO. If they play ignorant, tell them the lab told you that they are the ones who bill you, and you need a price.

Edit: healthcarebluebook (Google) is a great resource for seeing what average and fair costs are for any medical service."
HealthInsurance,Have you already checked the health insurance marketplace for something cheaper than COBRA?
HealthInsurance,"I work in health insurance. I can tell you, it will be damn near impossible to get a price for your coinsurance quoted. There's too many variables involved."
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,The new business will require enough employees (2 I think) to be able to obtain a group plan.
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"if you say so. 

a quick scan indicates dozens of plans available, &amp; $1,500 will get you at least gold-level coverage with zero premium credits. With annual income of $80k &amp; down you'd qualify for credits of around $600/month

So what do I win for discovering you may come in under budget on your health coverage? ;-)"
HealthInsurance,"That probably won’t happen, unfortunately. Bf is touchy about asking his parents for favors/seeming like he can’t handle life (in his eyes). The reason I ask actually is because he had a weird childhood and I think could benefit from seeing a therapist or something similar. Just wanted to see what might be covered. "
HealthInsurance,"At 90% coinsurance, I would have expected YOUR costs to be $38! 

Honestly, besides for negotiating with the provider or threading to not pay them (but they can send you to collections) I’m not sure what you can do. Might be more of a headache and cost more money/time than just paying it and moving on. Sorry this answer sucks, but hopefully someone else on here has an idea!?"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah I’m thinking it’s one of those “Medical Cost Sharing” arrangements - think there’s one called “Medi-Share”. Maybe a user can comment on those.

u/realanceps"
HealthInsurance,Most petty midyear adjustment ever. Last update I had is that they were discussing softening the transition by waiving penalties for people that front-loaded their account. Would be nice.
HealthInsurance,Thanks! I'll look into all that.
HealthInsurance,You should be able to call the insurance company and change your PCP at any time.
HealthInsurance,That's what I fear...
HealthInsurance,Are you leaving an old job that covered you to start this new job?  You may be able to go back to prior employer and elect COBRA coverage and not have a gap before your new coverage kicks in.  You have 60 days to elect COBRA from when your prior employer notified you of your COBRA eligibility.
HealthInsurance,"Agree with zebra-stampede, but also to answer a specific question you asked: Medi-Cal does not have a maximum lifetime/annual benefit AS LONG as you continue to qualify for Medi-Cal. So, worse case scenario, something major happens to you, you would want to remain independent and make sure that your parent's income would not be considered into your household income. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for your feedback. I will try to contact them. Much appreciated. "
HealthInsurance,"I'm just looking at options. I asked my doctor to rewrite the referral in order to get the home test, which is only $250. I can afford this. 

Do you know if the quality of the results is different between the two studies?"
HealthInsurance,Right? They actually told me to make sure it was sent by fax and not email.
HealthInsurance,"I did the home test and it went “well”. My doctor only recommends the facility test if the patient struggled with the at home test. I’m actually surprised your insurance didn’t deny the facility test without documentation that the home test wouldn’t work for you "
HealthInsurance,"Don’t look in the Marketplace, just google individual health insurance plans. "
HealthInsurance,good point. behavioral medicine comes to mind (pun not intended).
HealthInsurance,"Hi! The correct answer really depends on the total amount he will be paid. Assuming he works a standard 8 hrs at $14/hr he would be paid less than $600 making him a 1099 employee - in that case I’d say no, no need to inform anyone. If it turns permanent than yes he should notify the state. He can also always call his case worker (he has one whether he knows it or not) and chat with them for more details. Just curious - is his HIP plan through CareSource, Envolve or DentaQuest?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Its cobsidered the most secure way to send documents.

by whom? Because that's nonsense.

source: used to work for major fax mfgr/marketer"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the link. I'll be doing some reading. "
HealthInsurance,"Than no, it wouldn't benefit you to have as it wouldn't count as a ""real"" health insurance plan, so you would be penalized during tax season. 

This happens a lot to the unsuspecting, so I'm glad you questioned it.

Also: Note: MultiPlan is NOT an insurance company but it is a NETWORK of health insurance plans, so the person who told you it wasn't a health insurance company was correct, they act as a 3rd party processor. 

Just ask them straight out if they are an approved ACA plan.  "
HealthInsurance,"I applied in early April and they approved my application; they said my estimated effective date is April 1 and that my next step is to pay my first month’s premium when the provider contacts me. I guess if I don’t hear something tomorrow I’ll suck it up and call. (My throat hurts something fierce, I can hardly talk to my roommates!). Thanks!"
HealthInsurance,You would probably save a lot of money getting treatment at a dental school. Worth making some phone calls.
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Should I check with my insurance company to see what's taking so long 

Yes.  I'd put money on the answer being that they requested more info from hospital and are waiting on it."
HealthInsurance,"Has Cigna paid their portion yet? Do you have deductibles or copays you're responsible for?  "
HealthInsurance,"I work for a different BCBS, not Iowa, but I cannot fathom them ""punishing"" a member for checking covered benefits. It just wouldn't happen. So that can't be correct. 

I've also not heard of a family plan being dropped completely due to one member leaving. 

Call the customer service number on the back of your card for information specific to your policy. It sounds like your parents are incorrect."
HealthInsurance,"I know they used to, but I will give them a call tomorrow to find out if that's changed.  If it has, my pharmacy definitely shouldn't have been charging me a 90 day supply cost, though.  "
HealthInsurance,Agreed. Short-term is probably your best option at this point barring a qualifying life event that would allow you to get a Marketpalce/ACA Qualified Health Plan (see a list here: [http://www.healthreformbeyondthebasics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SEP-Reference-Chart.pdf](http://www.healthreformbeyondthebasics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SEP-Reference-Chart.pdf)).
HealthInsurance,"Not sure why my significant other has it set in their mind that the out of pocket max is what you'd have to meet before insurance will pay anything, which is perhaps why he thinks this plan is catastrophic insurance. "
HealthInsurance,"His work does not offer health insurance. He does need their help for health insurance. If he were to enroll in community college, would it then be possible to get it back?"
HealthInsurance,"I've had really good luck with the pharmacy I use. I can tell you that the Retin A that I've ordered from them is legit because I do in fact look better at 42 than I did at 37. I can also tell you that in the rare instance I do find myself in need of an antibiotic, the ones I've ordered to keep on hand have worked well. "
HealthInsurance,"ACA plans are available to cover children only - designed I believe for your situation. Phone reps at Healthcare.gov directly to confirm plans available in your area. One issue: are they covered presently, or recently, &amp; if so how? Your ability to enroll them outside the annual enrollment window will depend on their eligibility for a special election period"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! I'm hoping I get some clarification because this seems like a predicament a lot of people find themselves in. I'm almost to the point that I'd rather take the tax penalty than deal with this stuff!
"
HealthInsurance,"Even if he could be on the parent's plan, the parents don't have to keep him on their plan. Maybe they just decided they didn't want to pa his premium past 23 and dropped him.

If he lost coverage in the last 60 days then he would still be in his special enrollment period. Once he's outside of that, he'll probably have to wait until 2019 to buy a plan barring another qualifying life event. Keep in mind that this upcoming Monday April 30th would be the last day for him to enroll in a plan with a May 1st effective date. Assuming he's still within his 60 day special enrollment period (60 days from the date his other plan ended), then if he submitted an application in May, his plan won't be effective until June."
HealthInsurance,"Honestly, you're really not going to have a choice in the matter. Once you make enough money to get you off the subsidy that you currently have, then you will have to go on the employer insurance or continue with the government-sponsored plan (I'm assuming you're talking about a plan from healthcare.gov?) and just pay the new price that they will be offering to you. 

Deciding on which one to go with will depend on the factors of monthly cost to you, deductible on each plan, what is covered/not-covered, etc. "
HealthInsurance,"You should reference the premiums given to you by your employer. That will tell you how much it'll be to add her to your plan. Medications should be covered but could be subject to a deductible. Depends on how your plan is set up. "
HealthInsurance,"I called aetna themselves and that is what they told me. The invoice is dated last week and they said it was strange but did not matter.

Also 1 of the 3 individuals told me that they were out of network. The others said they were in network. Is there anyway for me to check? I am going to call the lab itself when they open tomorrow and double check because aetna is telling me something different every time.

Is there anyway to have united, my secondary, pay for it if aetna wont?"
HealthInsurance,"Call the district attorney's office in the county where he was convicted and ask to be put in contact with their victim advocate. Explain to them your problem, and ask for help getting state insurance without the paternity, or else help establishing paternity while also cancelling his rights. "
HealthInsurance,That’s a good idea. Thanks!
HealthInsurance,"My husband carried Insurance A, and was laid off after we had met that deductible for our daughter. We opted into COBRA, hit that deductible because daughter needed semi-emergency heart surgery. Husband got a new job, and we started all over again with the deductible for Insurance B. 

We paid out about $10k on just daughter's deductibles that year (and then we hit our family deductible in January the following year due to a heart procedure and a pregnancy/birth). It was horrendous. "
HealthInsurance,I saw it a lot on older plans. It was really only with the ACA policies that it deductible accumulations started beong included in the OOP at the company where I work.
HealthInsurance,"Exactly that's, I wish more people knew this. Very large part of what our elected representatives do is called constituency casework. Essentially, people run into issues, and they contact their representatives to help make the wheels run in the doors open. Contact your congressman. They should be able to set a person on it."
HealthInsurance,here's a [walkthru of a COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) we sometimes use around here as an example
HealthInsurance,"Gotcha, okay thank you! "

HealthInsurance,Good bot
HealthInsurance,"Just choose a new doctor and have them get your medical records, including the blood test results. If your doctor wants additional tests, he/she can order them. You shouldn't get the same bloodwork again, as they may get denied due to just having them, but don't worry about that, your old doctor will release them/give them to the new doctor, once you find one and fill out a medical release to get the records. "
HealthInsurance,"Honestly, I would simply ask the insurance companies point blank, ""If I have a flare up of my AD that requires a hospital visit while I'm traveling, will it be covered, or is it still considered a pre-existing and thus denied?""

As far as the $1,000,000 limit, it certainly sounds like a lot for just a 1.5 month visit, even if there was an emergency room visit, having charges for more than $250,000 would require a major health/body breakdown (systems failing, etc). I know the USA is high medical fees, but personally, I would only get the $1,000,000 limit if I was in the country for more than 90 days and had extreme medical conditions. "
HealthInsurance,"From my experience, when this happened at our clinic, we would simply tell the lab to bill the physician's office, then WE would bill the labwork/tests to the insurance company. We end up getting a discount (physician rate) from the lab, and then we were able to get paid from the insurance company. 

Contact the office manager of your provider, tell her that her staff member sent the blood to the wrong lab and that you need her to contact the lab to have them balance bill the office, not the insurance company and go from there. "
HealthInsurance,"Are you in Australia? Cuz I can research, but I don't think anyone here is an expert in Australian insurance."
HealthInsurance,"Based on comments from others, OP would have to be a ""health benefits 1 percenter"" to reach her plan's annual out-of-pocket spending cap. In fact you'd probably be a ""fraction of a percenter"". My advice: do NOT make that a personal goal"

HealthInsurance,"If you're a non-smoker and your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is 1600/mo or $19,200 per year, then you should be eligible for a free plan or close to it via the Marketplace. For example, here's the lowest premium plan in Pierre, South Dakota for a 50 year old non-smoker with $19,200 for MAGI: https://go.hc.gov/2H8C2wI
you would also be eligible for a plan with cost-sharing (lower out of pocket costs) like this one:
https://go.hc.gov/2H7AGCN

None of this is specific to you. You would have to enter your zip code, age, county, etc to see your specific quotes. Here's the link to preview plans:
https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/

If you completed an application and it says the lowest premium plan is $450 (assuming your 2018 magi is 19200), then there is probably a problem with your application that is making the marketplace think you're ineligible for an subsidy."

HealthInsurance,"I remember looking into insurance as a student and rates were really favorable. Definitely not $5k/year. However, this was with Blue Cross Blue Shield in North Carolina. The coverage is for individual only. "
HealthInsurance,"I’ve had dr. Office visits before with the new insurance that had $30 copays.  So this plan had $30 office visit copays which I payed when I went to 2 separate clinic doctors in the city I work in.

It was when I went back to my hometown to see my PCP that the insurance changed from tier 1 to tier 2 and became much more expensive.  My plan didn’t change, the tier changes depending on which hospital/medical center you are at.  I would have never gone to my PCP had I known it was going to be so expensive.  And I absolutely would never have agreed to all this blood work and lab tests.  

This was the whole reason I called my insurance company before the appt as well as why I badgered the receptionist at the PCP office about whether or not there would be extra cost and making sure I wasn’t out of network.  It’s infuriating to know that i used caution and it didn’t mean anything. QIts feels like I looked both ways before crossing the street and then got blasted by an invisible semi as soon as I took a step."
HealthInsurance,"It's the max per year set by the irs. The amount you set up to come out of your paycheck comes out pretax and the funds roll over each year. There is no limit to the amount in the account, just a limit to how much you can contribute each year. You can use the funds for any approved medical expense, including dental and vision.  You can Google for a list of approved expenses thru an hsa."
HealthInsurance,"You are going to need to sign a release at your new doctor's office to get the records from the old one.

Whether that blood work is sufficient for the new one is up to the new guy."

Try googling ""[your state] Marketplace Navigators"" -- if you don't find a contact near you let me know and I can do some hunting."
HealthInsurance,"Yes! It took several weeks and lots of hours on the phone and threats, but the hospital pulled out it's proof that it had filed but it was insurance's system that wasn't working correctly. Insurance allowed them to paper file after I was told over and over that no one could ever paper file. Insurance paid everything plus a little extra so I got a little refund. "
HealthInsurance,"If you just recently lost employer sponsored coverage, and your new employer doesn't directly offer a specific policy, you probably qualify for a Covered California Special Enrollment Period: https://www.coveredca.com/individuals-and-families/getting-covered/special-enrollment/"
HealthInsurance,Does your insurance allow 90 day supplies of that drug? My specialty drug is only allowed to be shipped in 30 day refills.  If this just started in January it might be a change in your plan for this year.
HealthInsurance,"Call and ask.  Sometimes they will let you reinstate but it varies from carrier to carrier. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you, I appreciate the answer!"
HealthInsurance,Have you lost insurance in the last 60 days?
HealthInsurance,"Capital blue or geissinger. Both are fine "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;And I know my doctors office isn't going to give me the money back to even me out for giving me what is essentially a 60 day supply even though I've paid the money for a 180 day supply.

I'm with HiGloss, but this doesn't make sense to me. Your MD has bunged up your script, but other than maybe an office visit copay the $ you laid out for your Rx shouldn't be in your MDs pocket - it's somewhere in the Rx payments stream, no?"
HealthInsurance,"1. Yes
2. Yes, but the workplace plan would be be the primary plan. The secondary plan (your plan) would only pay if the primary plan doesn't cover the treatment. But if they do cover it she would have to pay the deductible first. If you've already met the OOP max that seems like a bad deal. 
3. That's what I would do in this situation, I would decline health insurance from my employer and then probably just enroll later when they have open enrollment. I would only get the employer insurance if the employer covered it 100% and there was a $0 deductible. If that's not the case though, paying a second premium and another deductible seems like a waste of money. 

When your daughter starts at her new job and gets more info about their insurance plans, you can look up their Coordination of Benefits to find out more about how the two plans would work exactly. Here's a link if you wanna read more about having two plans: https://www.insure.com/health-insurance/primary-health-plans.html"

HealthInsurance,"Damn. Well, I can usually answer any question regarding Medicare, but I honestly have no experience with something like this. 

It's definitely an extremely rare situation. I would not be surprised if you do need to talk to a lawyer. With your condition, and the glacial pace of govt bureaucracy, a lawyer really might be a good idea.

The other thing you could try and do is contact an insurer directly, as in not through the marketplace. A motivated sales rep might be able to get something done.

Edit: what county are you in? Feel free to pm me if you don't want to post here."
HealthInsurance,"Yes true. The plan we might be going with is an HMO with a deductible of 6300 and OOP max of 7000 per person. So essentially it covers not much (other than copays for some visits and preventative stuff) until you hit the OOP max. Making it sort of like a catastrophic plan. 

I'm having the broker send me the details on the plan to see what the international coverage is like. I'm guessing cost of minor things like cough/cold won't be worth the hassle of claiming with the travel insurance. But I want to make sure I'm covered if I have an accident or something. 

Along the way I noticed, that there is an very similar HMO plan that is an HDHP/HSA plan (similar premium, lower yearly deductible). Is there any reason why we shouldn't do that one? I feel like if I'm taking on a high deductible plan, why not pay with pre-tax dollars. 

I'm going to be self-employed rest of this year. If I make no money, I have to pay with post-tax dollars as I would have with the non-hdhp plan. If I make some money, I can put it into the HSA and pay with pre-tax dollars. Am I missing something?
"
HealthInsurance,I hope so. Read there reinstatement policy so hopefully they allow me to. Thanks!
HealthInsurance,"If you plan on holding onto a high deductible health plan (HDHP) long-term, it's best to put as much money that you're willing to put because of the tax benefits and that you can carryover. The IRS deposit only applies to each year so you can have more than that."
HealthInsurance,So how do you know if the drug will be covered for one diagnosis and not the other? Like adderall is approved for narcolepsy but not hypersomnia. Where is that difference of diagnosis happening when you try to get the script filled?
HealthInsurance,"Call Wellmark directly yourself and they will tell you what is covered under your plan and can help you find in-network doctors. You can also call your mothers employer's HR yourself and ask for copies of the SPD and Plan Documents. 

I've worked in health insurance for 10+ years and have NEVER heard of coverage being dropped just because one member left the plan. Frankly if this were true, what would she do when you turned 26 and could no longer be included on her plan anymore? It sounds like she is either misinformed about her coverage or not telling you the truth although I do not know why she would want to keep you from a surgery you need."
HealthInsurance,"Regulations prohibit termination of coverage due to “costing too much.”  ...Unless the plan is some sort of older grandfathered plan with a lifetime limit. 

Are you certain that’s the reason for losing coverage?"
HealthInsurance,"You really cant besides searching based on your location requirements and looking for reviews. "
HealthInsurance,"They're not ""sticking it"" to anyone with a family, they are simply just not subsidizing the cost of the premium for additional members like they do for employee coverage. "
HealthInsurance,"Your ER visit should be treated as an in network visit, but be prepared to pay out of network charges for the Ambulance ride. There are a ton of Ambulance companies that do not take insurance and typically your plan would treat them as out of network even if medically necessary. "
HealthInsurance,"I paid 2 months up front, then forgot about it. I was on auto-pay all last year, but forgot to set it up again this year. I did not pay for March, April. The agent i spoke to put me on hold, spoke to a manager, then came back and said no. 

I thought they would accept my money (esp since I don't even use insurance) but guess not. Bad luck! Hope I can survive healthily rest of the year lol"
HealthInsurance,"He's probably wrong.

He needs to pick a policy and go in for a medical evaluation. If he is 60, ""well off"", and of sound mind there isn't much you can do about him short of putting him in touch with a health insurance agent who may be able to explain things better. 
"
HealthInsurance,"At this point , no I don't have anything lined up."
HealthInsurance,"Where did you apply for an Obamacare plan? There’s no such thing as making too much for one, only making too much to get government help to pay for it — I want to make sure you applied in the right place. "
HealthInsurance,"I think my max out-of-pocket is $5k per person, $10k family for in-network, which was about the same as my previous PPO. 
For ""Emergency Health Services - Outpatient"", it looks like I pay nothing after meeting the deductible, whether in or out of network.
For almost in-network common medical events, this seems to be the case, that the plan covers everything after I meet my annual deductible, with a few exceptions such as off-label drugs for cancer treatment and gender dysphoria, which are listed as ""Depends on where the covered health service is provided"". There's a hefty list of excluded treatments, but doesn't look to be too far outside the norm.

Out of curiosity, what kind of project are you working on?"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks! He has a job but it’s at a sandwich shop. No benefits to speak of. Like I said, his mom is a public school teacher but his dad is a pastor and they have some sort of group insurance that is religiously affiliated. If it was through his moms job it shouldn’t be a problem but if it’s through this other program they might be able to do whatever they want to an extent.

Thanks again for your insight. I wish I had more details about the specific insurance plan. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;some kind of reliable estimate of what a procedure would cost me if I elect to do it.

[HealthCare  BlueBook](https://www.healthcarebluebook.com/page_ConsumerFront.aspx) provides estimates of procedure charges. Reliability winds up being in the eye of the beholder. There are other estimators, which are more or less reliable &amp; more or less easy to use (eg, FairHealth Consumer)"
HealthInsurance,"The only thing I can think of is that if your company provides ""affordable"" health insurance [you cannot get the subsidy on the marketplace](https://www.healthinsurance.org/faqs/my-employer-offers-insurance-but-i-think-its-too-expensive-can-i-apply-for-a-subsidy-to-help-me-buy-my-own-insurance/), so if you used the subsidy to reduce the cost of your health plan you'll have to pay that back."
HealthInsurance,so it's recommended to deposit funds into the HSA every week/month. Is the IRS deposit limit the max for a year or the entire amount allowed within the savings account?
HealthInsurance,"I ended up calling UHC again and explained the situation to them. Essentially they said that they are transferring the case to their balance billing department.

They said that they dont think Aetna is treating me fairly so they are elevating it to a department that will call aetna and argue over who pays what. 

Not sure if this is a resolution since it will take 30-45 days for them to figure it out. Even then, UHC did not actually say they would pay if Aetna still refuses to pay.

Thanks for the help everyone!"
HealthInsurance,"If you get sick a lot or have any medical conditions, the PPO is a better option. If you're relatively healthy, which it sounds like you are, the HSA is a better option."
HealthInsurance,"Sorry I just saw this, and unfortunately the issue is still not resolved.

I don't, it was just taken out of my paychecks. I do have the card though which shows it was issued in December of 2016 and I used it all of 2017 for various medical services."
HealthInsurance,"Insurance will pay out 100% of an in network claim once you reach your out of pocket maximum. Getting to $1 million would be impressive. No plan these days has 95% coinsurance. The most you can be responsible for is 40% on a bronze level plan. Silver is 30%, gold is 20%, and platinum plans are 10% coinsurance. Every plan will have an out of pocket maximum, after which your plan pays 100% for in network claims. There is no lifetime maximum on any ACA compliant plan, as most plans are. You do pay 100% before a deductible, if your plan has one. 

If your friend paid 200k after an out of pocket max, then their care was either out of network, or this was prior to 2014 / their plan was otherwise grandfathered and not subject to benefits provided by the ACA. 
"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Because you’re technically obliged to claim him as your dependent on your tax return

I'm stuck on this bit, which I'm not certain is or ever was an actual thing"
HealthInsurance,"So is she not going to have coverage available to her at all or are you looking for a short term solution before the new coverage kicks in?  Something folks don't always take into account is the cost of insurance when flipping employers.  It can be pretty significant.  Do you have any employees with your own biz where you could start your own group policy? "
HealthInsurance,"Yes, it should be based on your date of service."
HealthInsurance,"OP, all health coverage is ""local"" - your options, &amp; your costs for them, depend a lot on your specific circumstances. You've supplied some, but other details - particularly your location (city, state) - will help us provide  more actionable info. LSD's suggestion is kinda sorta good, but its applicability for you - for stuff like premium credits, and/or your eligibility to enroll in Medicaid - will depend a LOT on where you are."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the reply, I did this and will be on a plan soon. I opted for $50/mo plan with low out of pocket costar thanks for the help!"
HealthInsurance,"yes, he has to be enrolled to be eligible on his parents' health insurance."
HealthInsurance,"Kings county, NY "
HealthInsurance,"Actually some carriers now have a phone authorization  system. The doc calls into the system, enters all the information and they usually get an immediate answer. Aetna has this available."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the reply. The second hospital is the one that is known to me and which I already see a copay responsibility assigned to me; it’s the first visit that is unknown to me at this moment.
The reason I find this particularly disturbing is because from what I understand, higher ER copays are to discourage frivolous and non-emergency visits to the ER. In my case as my child didn’t get admitted to either hospital then fair enough I should pay a copay. But I shouldn’t (IMO) have to pay TWO ER copays because the first hospital punted me to another hospital instead of admitting us, with me having no say in the matter. "
HealthInsurance,The claim is processing as you've already seen. Can take weeks to process a claim. Don't pay anything until you see your EOB.
HealthInsurance,Healthcare.com and then later when i didnt really get any traction from healthcare.com i went to healthcare.gov but it said enrollment period was closed
HealthInsurance,"You can pay cash. Prob around 15 dollars unless you're getting a brand name. 

Some insurances have “vacation overrides”

Call your insurance to find out "
HealthInsurance,"You're over 18, you're an adult. You don't need your parents to get health insurance. As in, you'd be the primary insured on the plan. Legislation merely allows children to be a dependent on a parents healthcare until 26, it doesn't require it. "
HealthInsurance,Your best bet is to go to healthcare.gov and see your options.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;My Dads former company (Cisco) has a retirement plan which he is eligible for, however they had to enroll within 60 days after loss of coverage. Because of moving out and forgetting to pay COBRA they are now ineligible for this plan and are becoming increasingly concerned about their healthcare going forward.

Feels like there's info missing here. Did dad receive some kind of severance package? Occasionally the terms of health coverage extension in those situations *resemble* COBRA but are not ""really"" COBRA coverage. Guess I'm lookiing for more specifics on the nature of dad's coverage extension and whatever appeals process may be available to dad for reinstating coverage - IF that's necessary to retain eligibility for coverage in retirement."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks!  I managed to get the CPT codes from my doctor's office, but they needed the tax ID along with like 6 or 7 other pieces of information I didn't have to even try and estimate how much the discounted rate would be.

The contracted rate is not affected by the deductible right?  If I understand correctly, the contracted rate is the amount that is actually billed to insurance, so if insurance doesn't pay due to the deductible, that is the rate I pay?  "
HealthInsurance,Make sure you vote and get health insurance in November.
HealthInsurance,"I understand what you're saying.... Altho what doctor this day in age is only charging $50-60 for an office visit?  Lucky you, you're very fortunate if it's the case!
Also, god for bid, but you need to anticipate illness with children even being so young and they are healthy. If by chance there's additional doctor visits needed, an emergency room visit or admittance to hospital (allergic reaction or even x-rays for upper respiratory), medications (maybe ear infection.) 
After 4 children, I've learned it's better to be safe than sorry. It's definately worth the investment for a child.
Don't kill yourself over worrying about them getting sick but it's more of a worry financially if you don't have it.  Best of luck."
HealthInsurance,"Worst case, in a given year 

HSA: 1092 + 6350

PPO: 2600 + 6350

I'd do the HSA since it's also a triple tax advantage account. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;could I save myself the hassle and just not apply for interim coverage unless I actually end up with a bill?

here's a [walkthru of a COBRA bridge strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) which covers the nuts &amp; bolts of this kind of approach"
HealthInsurance,"I'm not trying to ""convince"" anyone my current insurance plan exists. I frequently use it in various states across the country. I get the same coverage regardless of where I am. My family members all live in different parts of the country and all receive the same coverage. I'm not asking about my current plan - I understand how it works. 

Individual plans with nation-wide coverage certainly *do* exist, though they tend to be more expensive, and not many companies offer them. In my situation, one expensive national plan is probably cheaper than keeping several state plans. I was hoping to narrow my search a bit by seeing which companies other people have gotten such plans from. "
HealthInsurance,"in most instances, keeping money in your pocket is your best financial option. You can [model your total cost of coverage for each option following this illustration](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif)."
HealthInsurance,"Check and see what your prescription benefits are. Do you have a separate deductible for scripts? 

Not sure how UHC will differ but BCBS will typically only cover tier 1 and 2 drugs at a copay price, tier 3 and 4 are subject to deductible then coinsurance. Maaaaaaybe a copay for tier 3. Call UHC see what tier they put Vyvanse as and what the benefit for that tier is. "
HealthInsurance,"This sounds like services not rendered as billed, which is definitely fraud. Additional units should have been requested prior to rendering the additional services. By billing for a different DOS than what was actually rendered, the insurance is paying for something that technically wasn’t rendered as billed and could have resulted in no payment. The fact that the dates of service are being changed from what they really are to allow payment is a huge red flag."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"I finally heard back from my benefits administrator and the monthly premium of my current plan is  $700!!!  The plan has a very HIGH deductible close to $2000 and came with a HSA so I was soo surprised to hear the high cost of premium ...unfortunately I contacted Covered CA and they also told me I don't qualify for special enrollment, I don't know what to do. Anyone can offer me advice? Medi-cal? I don't think I qualify for that since my annual income is already above the limit."
HealthInsurance,"HSA = Health Savings Account and FSA = Flexible Savings Account. You can carryover funds year over year through an HSA, but usually pay a fee to Payflex when you no longer have a high-deductible plan anymore and still have money in your account. An FSA is limited from year to year. If you don't use the money you put in, you'll lose it. 

Payflex is a vendor who acts as an intermediary between your health insurer and you. Basically, think of them as a bank where you can put money in for either your HSA or FSA (depending on what you chose as your option) to pay for your doctor visits, pharmacy purchases, emergency care, etc.

You probably selected a set dollar amount to enter into your HSA or FSA. Let's say you decided to put $500 for the year into your HSA. Using your Mastercard, you can will deduct from the $500 that are approved services."
HealthInsurance,"No, you shouldn't lose / pay to maintain an HSA although I've never tried NOT putting any money into an HSA. I've only put money into an HSA with the plan of actually using it to pay for medical costs when I was enrolled in a high-deductible insurance plan. The Payflex Mastercard only applies to medical related purchases so no, you can't use it at McDonalds for example."
HealthInsurance,"Run like hell. US Health Advisors have a terrible reputation and those plans are junk compared to an ACA plan.

There might be options in your area for plans outside of the Marketplace/Healthcare.gov, but unless you have a qualifying life event ([list here](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/)), you're probably not going to be eligible to enroll in them until the next open enrollment period. Contact a local health insurance broker and see if they can give you options for a ""qualified health plan that meet the requirements under the Afforable Care Act"" (use these words) and they should be able to tell you if there are any off the marketplace options. It's hard to find brokers these days that are willing to help folks enroll in these types of plans because many of the companies offering them aren't paying commissions. 

Why do you think you need a PPO? Depending on your state, there may or may not be a PPO plan available to you (even with a qualifying life event). If there is one, you'll usually pay more for a PPO than an HMO and it doesn't necessarily mean it will be a better plan for you. Comparing a PPO vs. an HMO is difficult because they're not uniform by any means, but a PPO usually has a more broad network of providers and often offers out of network coverage. This is great for folks who either spend a lot of time outside of their home area or for folks with lots of medical needs who might need to see a wide variety of providers."
HealthInsurance,"Have you gone on healthcare.gov, set up an account, plug in your information and see what is presented to you? That's what I would do, then you'll see a variety of what is out there, for you and your family, in the area that you'll be living in. "
HealthInsurance,"You can earn up to $98,400 and still qualify for tax credits on the Marketplace with a family of 4 ([source](http://www.healthreformbeyondthebasics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/REFERENCEGUIDE_Yearly-Guidelines-and-Thresholds_2018.pdf). Cover kids will be cheaper but you’ll have to earn so much less... you won’t come out ahead by earning less, as long as you stay below that $98k mark. Since you’re self-employed, you’ll report only your net income (Modified AGI) for the Marketplace - you can take lots of deductions, including for health insurance. Go [here](https://www.healthcare.gov/apply-and-enroll/health-insurance-plans-estimator-overview/) to preview plans. And yes, you have 60 days after your children’s birth to enroll. Congrats!"
HealthInsurance,"Is me contacting each provider the right solution? Or should I let the uhc rep handle it? I feel like maybe they will blow me off. What should I do if a claim goes to collections? Should I be telling them to resubmit a claim or reprocess a claim? I think resubmit is an entirely new claim disregarding the old one, and reprocess edits an old claim and resends it. Thanks! Any advice is greatly appreciated!"
HealthInsurance,One of the regulars here works for Aetna. I'll hit him up.
HealthInsurance,"Yes.  Weight loss medications are considered to be lifestyle drugs.  Most insurances don't cover those types of medications.  

Also, if it is an off label indication than coverage might be denied."

HealthInsurance,"This exactly, most plans cover emergency claims as inn (as long as its billed as an emergency), but some require you call them soon after admission.  First step is definitely to call your insurance to see what the details are."
HealthInsurance,"Nope, through my employer. I wanted to be seen for speech therapy, and the provider reached out to Aetna for pre-authorization.

The provider then called me and told me that they are actually ""in-network"" for physical therapy, etc., but not for speech therapy.

Of course, the website, and mobile app for Aetna is showing, otherwise... and an Aetna agent on the phone just told me that the facility is ""in network"" for speech therapy.

Can Aetna back-track? or will they honor my ""screen-shots?"" or are ""screen-shots"" not taken seriously?"
HealthInsurance,"Your primary residential address doesn't really matter to your wife's insurance company, as they are the ones providing the insurance to you as a dependent. 

I would suggest looking into your out of network benefits, which would allow you to find and see a doctor in the state your school is in, making it much easier for you. However, if there are no out of network benefits or it's a deductible that is too high for you to pay vs. driving back to your wife's state, then you'll have to grin and bear it while you travel back to your wife's state to get the medical care. 

Another option is to check into your schools insurance plans that they offer to students, to see if that is something that could work for you. "
HealthInsurance,that will depend - a lot - on where OP is - what state.

HealthInsurance,"I’ll try!Did you get the Rx from pcp or naturopath? "
HealthInsurance,Your still going to have to pay your copay - But the rest will get sorted out once you call billing and they resubmit it to your insurer.  This is actually extremely common - Especially in the ER.
HealthInsurance,$150 is 700% MORE? How cheap was this plan and was the company subsiding it? That would explain a lot.
HealthInsurance,"Keep your insurance. That isn't going into effect until 2019. When you do your taxes for 2018, you will still be asked to provide proof of coverage. 

And as for you not wanting to have insurance, you need it. I'm sure you'd rather pay your deductible than 30k in medical bills if you ever have to go to the hospital. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"HDHP and high deductible are relative terms. Unless you know of a marketing regulation I’m not aware of. I suppose it wouldn’t necessarily be correct to say all HSA eligible plans are HDHPs, since that depends on your perspective of “high deductible”. For my clients, I don’t consider $2-2.5k to be a HDHP."
HealthInsurance,"These plans aren't by United Health Group, it's US Health Group. These are non ACA compliant plans which are full of exclusions and limitations. They don't count as health insurance under the ACA and you would be subject to the penalty.  I wouldn't touch these plans with a 10 foot pole."
HealthInsurance,"With the cutting of federal funding subsidies for ACA insurance my premiums jumped 150 per month to over 600. And that’s just for me with no family or kids. "
HealthInsurance,"Ah well that sucks.  It sounds like the previous response was correct and you got hit with the ""anesthesiologist is out of network"" BS.  A lot of anesthesiologists don't take insurance at all and like to bill you after the fact for the full amount.  There's really nothing you can do about that except talk to the hospital beforehand and ask that everyone who touches you takes your insurance. You have to be pretty persistent about it sometimes. Truly sucks. You can try to negotiate with the hospital.  Never hurts to be outraged with the billing department. :)"

HealthInsurance,do you know anyone who can help me?
HealthInsurance,"Hi. Just because you missed the renewal doesn't actually mean you aren't eligible anymore, it just means that basically you not returning the renewal packet tells us you don't want or need Medicaid anymore. We can't keep the coverage open without you requesting to keep it open. 

You can just reapply at any time and they will reopen your coverage as long as you are still income eligible. You may be able to use the renewal packet as a new application, or fill out a new application online or on paper. Provide proof of current income with that. 

You can appeal, but that's not really going to do anything and would only work in your favor if the state did anything wrong or against policy which it doesn't appear they did since they sent you the packet you just didn't return it. Appeals are supposed to be for if you believe the state made a mistake or did something wrong on your case. I hope that makes sense! "

HealthInsurance,"Is this bloodwork getting done at an out-of-network lab?

Eventually you should hit your max out-of-pocket, at which point they'll cover everything, but it seems  a bit odd to me to have such a steep coinsurance with no deductible unless this was out of network."
HealthInsurance,I might have some suggestions for you! I'm going to private message you.
HealthInsurance,"The real question is, did you pay your premiums or submit your tax information to healthcare.gov to get your subsidy? It's possible the plan lapsed due to nonpayment."
HealthInsurance,"Any sort of life change event qualifies you for a special enrollment period. 

Moving
Having a baby

If you e moved you can apply, if you and her officially divorce you can also apply. So whichever one happens first. "
HealthInsurance,"Hmm thank you for your answer. If that's the case, I wonder if he's eligible for Medicaid in Missouri. Do you have an idea on how one gets into that"
HealthInsurance,"Ah missed that part. 

And so contact your HR? The details should be made available to you in your benefits package, or through whatever online portal you use to elect benefits (for example, wherein you might also do 401k stuff, etc). 

That's great there's four providers, but entirely useless information otherwise haha. You need to know the premiums, deductible, out of pocket, etc in order to make a choice. "

HealthInsurance,"Just as an FYI - Florida did not expand their Medicaid program - To be eligible for a subsidy you must enter your income as at least 100% of the poverty limit (Currently $12,060 for an individual)"
HealthInsurance,Yes
HealthInsurance,*really*? It baffles you? You cant think of any reason?
HealthInsurance,Yep

HealthInsurance,"Ok, a couple of things here:

First, premiums. Is your wife's coverage through her employer? If so, you might have an increased cost to remain on her plan if you qualify for coverage with your own employer. She will need to check with her HR about this.

Second, when you have more than one plan we call the process of determining how they pay claims coordination of benefits. You don't get to decide which plan is primary- it will be the plan through your job. It will pay claims as if the secondary insurance does not exist. The secondary insurance determines how it corrdinates with other plans. Once your primary insurance processes a claim, you or your healthcare provider will file it to your secondary with the primary carrier's explanation of benefits, showing the remaining patient responsibility.

Say the entire claim goes to the deductible- the secondary insurance may ""cover"" that, either applying the amount to any applicable deductibles or coinsurances for your policy. It may also consider that amount covered by the primary since it went toward your benefits and deny it completely. Some plans don't play well with others.

In regards to prescriptions, that can be even more difficult. Assuming the plans will coordinate prescription coverage at all, most pharmacies will not (or maybe cannot) run the claim through two insurances. You would have to file a paper claim to your secondary each time after paying out of pocket for whatever your primary didn't cover. Depending on your coverage, that can get pricey.

I would recommend contacting the customer service for the current plan and talking to them about how they will pay as a secondary insurance."
HealthInsurance,"Student health plan. Most colleges and universities have it. Covers basics, which at this point in the industry should be what you need. You have to pay for it, but will go to your student account."
HealthInsurance,"The good news is you can't be denied coverage for preexisting conditions.

The bad news is you can't just enroll anytime you want to, or need to. There's an annual enrollment period in late fall of each year. That's months away.

If you had a [special qualifying event](https://www.healthcare.gov/screener/) you'd be able to enroll now, but it sounds like you probably don't. Fill in healthcare.gov's checklist anyway - who knows, maybe you'll get lucky.

Virginia has not expanded its Medicaid coverage so that option's out for you as well. You might be able to purchase non-ACA-compliant short term policies, but those won't cover your pre-existing conditions because, hey, that type of coverage is not ACA compliant.

How've you been dealing with penalities for not having coverage in previous years?"
HealthInsurance,"The things you are listing aren’t usually covered by insurance. It also depends on income. I would see what your current doctors accept, what you can afford and go from there"
HealthInsurance,"JulepeO is correct, losing coverage is a qualifying event and you can buy insurance on the exchange for your wife. "
HealthInsurance,What does this have to do with health insurance ?
HealthInsurance,"From checking on their website this isn't the case, it is still showing $0 towards my deductible, and the number for last year was just a few hundred dollars.

How should I go about trying to get this clarified with Premera?"
HealthInsurance,"HDHPs have been around longer than HSAs without the moniker of HDHP. Qualifying is the key word, as we both understand. Fully versed in what qualifies a plan to allow an individual to legally put away funds into an HSA. Again, violent agreement."
HealthInsurance,"You would have to go through healthcare.gov or “Obamacare” or maybe he would even do qualify for Medicaid? Unfortunately, I’ve worked in the employer healthcare market for 15 years so I’m not always up to date on all the rules and qualifiers within the individual markets. "
HealthInsurance,"Hi, 

Yes it's an individual plan that my employer is paying for completely. I'm filling out the paperwork today. 

At the top of the plan, it says ""Oxford Metro M Bronze EPO HSA $6550 100% Gated OHI CNT (HSA) (UCR=N/A)""

Does this help at all?

Thank you so much!"
HealthInsurance,"I am a health advisor, and there are some private plans out there and be able to stay well below that $1400 budget. If you want my input on some plans that you find I'd be more than happy to help."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks so much. "
HealthInsurance,If you don't qualify for an insurance subsidy *and* your state did *not* expand Medicaid (which sounds correct) you will not be penalized: https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/3-18-16%20ACA%20Exemptions%20One%20Pager%20-%20Medicaid%20Expansion.pdf
HealthInsurance,"Would it be worth moving to a different state that has Medicaid? I don’t think kansas (my state) has it. I moved back to my parents house in the US because of my injury and I’m leaving the country once my injury heals, so it’s not like I actually moved here."
HealthInsurance,"How much medical expenses do you incur a year?  

You should check the deductibles between the two plans to see if the savings is worth it to you or not."
HealthInsurance,Healthcare.gov with a subsidy (since your income will most likely be lower) is your best bet.
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"You should be offered COBRA, which is a continuation of the insurance you had while married to your wife. You will need to pay the full cost (no company subsidy) and you can keep it for up to 3 years. OR you can hit up your marketplace, ehealthinsurance, or an insurance broker to see what else is available and at what price. You may qualify for subsidies too, depending on your income. COBRA is usually more expensive, and the coverage is usually better, but there are exceptions so just get a plan you're comfortable with."
HealthInsurance,"Interested to take medical advantage plan which offers extra benefits such as dental care, wellness programs? If yes, then you are in a correct way. Approach us today as we are a top insurance agent to provide Medicare benefits."
HealthInsurance,INT means integrated with the deductible.  I'd say this means it's covered at 100% (your out of pocket is 0%) after the deductible.  What county are you in and what's the name of the plan? I can look it up to verify.
HealthInsurance,"Is she planning to soon transfer to a 4-year college? If so, they are obligated to provide coverage for an additional cost that can be paid with student loans. In my grad school, any student who is taking more than 9 credits is automatically enrolled ($1700 for the year) unless proof of other coverage is provided and a waiver is submitted. I’m not sure if the same requirements apply to community colleges, but I thought all full time students had to be offered coverage by their institution..."
HealthInsurance,"Depends on the drug. Most commercial employer plans still include drug coverage as a separate benefit from the high deductible part of the HDHP. In that regard, high cost/specialty medications are often covered at a standard copay or at worst a Co insurance without a separate Rx deductible, so not exactly accurate. HSA plans (not the HSA itself) require an integrated medical/rx deductible benefit to qualify for the HSA contribution. "
HealthInsurance,"The insurance will have basic information regarding the injury they receive through coders, aka people the hospital or organisation hire to translate injuries into what's called ICD-10. The insurance will have that information but not individual notes. The alcohol and pot would be made under an individual note for doctors as a guidance of if they need to check anything else, that could be wrong after the fall but insurance won't have that information. For example, they may Dona quick check for concussion but if they see no signs then they order no additional test and the coders don't enter that information, the insurance doesn't see it. All the information and background you give to nurses and doctors is used as a guide to determine possible injuries that may have taken place. 

 Additionally, you have patient protection under HIPAA, the hospital or insurance can't give that information out no matter how angry your mother's phone call.

Sorry for typos, being written quickly on a mobile."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, it sucks. I’m sorry!"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I was just wondering if what he did is illegal or not.

He billed insurer for $65, took $35 as payment? Yeah, that's fraud

"
HealthInsurance,"depending on the state you live in and your current health situation, you may not have to wait for open enrollment, and just save yourself some monthly cost without having to worry about being uncovered. either that, or at least pick up something that will help with small sickness and accidents. just in case. after all, insurance is specifically for the unplanned stuff."
HealthInsurance,"Ok.  So, in addition to what everyone else has said, let me say this.

**DO NOT PAY THIS DEBT**

This is your mother's debt.  She has passed.  This debt is **not** your responsibility.  If you pay on it, you can become liable for it.  Try to talk to the insurer, but the hospital can't come after you unless you pay.

**DO NOT PAY**"
HealthInsurance,"What insurance does your fiance have? "
HealthInsurance,Preach
HealthInsurance,"Yes we live together. My salary is 35k + commission, and she doesn't have income at the moment. We live in Fulton CO. "
HealthInsurance,"The problem was healthcare.gov wouldn't list any PPO plan for me to buy. I'll see if I can change, thanks for the reply"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks zebra. We might do the short term plan to buy us 3 months and then either get married or find a job for her that offers health insurance. "
HealthInsurance,You can try applying for the Georgia Peachcare Program - Depending on how much you make in commission and if your fiance is planning on going back to work you may not qualify.  You can apply for a policy on healthcare.gov - It should backdate to the day the baby was born.
HealthInsurance,Why is that?
HealthInsurance,"Ugh. Contact the [Cover Her hotline](https://nwlc.org/coverher/), who may be able to give you an answer — I’m not sure how network adequacy standards intersect with the contraceptive coverage requirement. "

HealthInsurance,"Thats not bad. I did a quote and I would pay $350 for a mid tier plan "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;At root, health insurance - most insurance - is pretty simple.

No, it isn't.  The concept, I suppose, is simple.  But the execution is an entirely separate matter.  And claims processing is only a piece of a much larger puzzle.

First, with automated (computerized) claims processing, while it's very true that less people are needed than even a decade ago, you need people to maintain/support all of your computer systems.  So you need an IT department.

You need an actuarial department (math experts) to crunch all those numbers.  And with that comes financial underwriting - so you need underwriters too.

And then there's medical underwriting, which is separate of financial underwriting.  Another dept for that.

Unless you plan on paying every claim under the assumption that everything is always medically necessary, you need a medical review department.  And many states require your medical review department to be staffed with licensed health care professionals - so you're paying doctor's and nurses salaries.

You need an appeals department, for detailed review of appeals.  There are all sorts of federal regs that apply to how appeals must be handled, how quickly, etc.

You need a legal department - to make sure you're doing everything legally.

You need a fraud department, to make sure you're not hemorrhaging cash to fraudulent claims.

You need a COB department, to coordinate benefits when the plans you're administering are secondary.  Not so much for the typical COB stuff (this can generally be handled by your claims examiners), but for other third party liability like coordinating with auto insurance when there's a car accident, or coordinating with workers comp, or if there is a civil lawsuit, etc.

You need a membership department - people who keep track of everyone who is enrolled, to process enrollment forms, to verify eligibility, etc.  Plus a whole separate computer system for that, probably - so more IT people.

With your IT department, you need a telecomm department - everyone's telephone has to work in the office.

Now your company is pretty big - hundreds of people, so HR department, custodial staff, building maintenance staff.  Oh, and, where's your building?  Do you own?  Lease?  Does it meet all your tele-networking and power needs?  Might need some engineers to upgrade the place.

Oh and a provider contracting and credentialing department - to make sure it's actual licensed doctors submitting claims and not some knucklehead working out of his garage clipping off warts for people with toenail clippers.  And you need to establish a provider network otherwise no one will want to buy your coverage because every doctor and hospital is out of network.

Now most of the above things can be contracted out to separate companies who can do all these functions for you - but you still need people to manage the contractors and such and it's likely not going to be financially feasible to contract everything because that can be really expensive.

Plus there's tons of stuff I'm forgetting.  The above list is likely no more that 60-70% of what you need.

edit to add:  I can't believe I forgot about customer service dept.  You need people to answer the phone.  And sales, SALES, someone needs to be selling your coverage..."
HealthInsurance,"I've never heard of someone coming after the patient because the insurance refuses to pay their part, especially if it really is their part to pay. Hell in some cases, if a hospital does not file a bill on time (usually 90 days), you the patient are not even responsible for your part of the bill. There's finely laid out procedures in the contracts about billing responsibilities and timeliness of filing claims and payouts. 

I'd get on the phone with a manager from BCBS and conference in someone from the hospital, and tell them to work it out, because if it is up to BCBS to pay, this is squarely not your problem and certainly not something you should have to deal with in the wake of your mother's death. I'm sorry for your loss. 

If they're an in network provider and they try to bill you for the insurance part of the claim, they will be in worlds of trouble due to that contract they have. Rest assured you won't be made to pay $115k. "
HealthInsurance," Okay, so to summarize the super long conversation we had, and undocumented alien can get health insurance, but not through the marketplace. You have to go directly to the health insurance company and apply. However, it's probably good to look at the marketplace plans, so that you know what companies provide service in your area. You won't be able to get subsidies or cost-sharing."
HealthInsurance,"I meant simply that you would not have many MEDICAL expenses. My apologies - I should have been more clear. I am all too aware of how school debt and limited funds starting out can make things a struggle.

I'm very confused by your employer's premiums - the HSA option is the most expensive, while the HMO is the middle of the road and the PPO is the cheapest? That defies basic economics. The entire point of the high deductible plan is that the insurance company doesn't pay a dime until you reach a certain level, so they have the least risk (making them them cheaper). An HMO plan has a very rigid network of doctors the insurance company works through to keep their contracted rate low (making them cheaper). A PPO offers the most flexibility in your providers and has the insurance company paying money out of their pocket almost from day one with copays. The premium structure should, by very definition, be inverted on what you are explaining.

In light of a more logical premium strucutre, my point was this - if you paid more for a PPO plan because it was ""safe,"" you would pay your premium and have nothing to show for it. If you got the (usually much cheaper) HSA plan and put the difference between what you spend on premiums into your HSA account, then you could walk away from that year with money in your pocket, money which can grow and ultimately make it so you never have to worry about how much your medical care costs.

Question - does your HSA plan have a large employer contribution that is tied to its enrollment? That's the only reason I can think of that would explain why it would cost more than than the HMO or PPO plans."

HealthInsurance,"Dermatology is a covered benefit under the ACA and Medi-Cal.  Neither Medi-Cal or another insurance company is going to cover anything that isn't medically necessary.

HealthInsurance,"&gt;eligible but every time I tried to contact them they did not get back to me.

Persevere. Did you tunnel in using [HealthFirst Colorado/Colorado PEAK](https://coloradopeak.secure.force.com/) (wow, haven't visited colorado's marketplace site in awhile - they've really made a confusing hash of things, sorry)?"
HealthInsurance,"While I can understand the sentiment, I cannot agree with this angle based on this simple assumption.

&gt; 1) You are young, therefore you are unlikely to have many expenses. For a PPO plan, this just means you don't pay any money. For an HSA plan, you are rewarded for not being sick/being young, as your money accumulates.

I am leery of this statement. I do have a significant expense in the form of student loans, one of which I don't see myself paying off at least for another 5 or 6 years by my estimate. We're talking more than $50,000, which I've had to kick down the road the last ten years through various means because I haven't had a ""decent"" job until now to pay for it and because I cannot default on it. I cannot float any ""investment"" strategies, simply because any money going into investment is money that should be going to pay off my debts. As it stands, on top of that, I have two medical debts, one of which has already gone to collection agencies (due to bad communication issues) and the other of which almost did, as well as a hefty tax bill because I couldn't afford to pay quarterly taxes in the nearly five months that I was out of work last year.

I'll consider an HSA in that respect in the future, but for now the PPO seems the most viable option for the immediate term."
HealthInsurance,"I should have mentioned, 500 max will roll over.  I don't think anything can be changed on the plan until next year's open enrollment period."
HealthInsurance,Yeah me neither
HealthInsurance,Thanks! I definitely intend to be better informed when it comes time to renew.
HealthInsurance,"Her's is 1/1.  I have a separate plan on BCBS, and it shows that it resets on 3/1.  My plan also has the 2018 SCB on it.  Her's shows that it resets on 1/1. "

HealthInsurance,"Thanks! The insurance company suggested seeing what insurance I used at urgent care too, but I still have my ID card for 2017 with all the info. When I gave them my SSN, they told me the only record they have of me is for 2018 even though I was insured by them 2016 and 2017 as well. "
HealthInsurance,"thanks for the information.  Just trying to make sure were not being taken advantage of. "

You can have a prescription drug plan, either as part of your HDHP or a separate plan (or rider), and qualify as an eligible individual *if the plan doesn’t provide benefits until the minimum annual deductible of the HDHP has been met*. **If you can receive benefits before that deductible is met, you aren’t an eligible individual.**

Please tell me more about this special deal for employer-sponsored HDHP plans
"
HealthInsurance,"Sorry I didn't see your message until now.
Once I start my new job, I'm going to call Covered CA to cancel (and also inquire about the premium assistance.)
I will let you know how that goes. But according to your link, I have a feeling I probably will end up paying it all back at tax time.

Good luck to you on the job hunt!!

My coverage was actually a Bronze Plan(?), so I think it might be one step up from the catastrophic plan. I am terrible at understanding these type of things, though."

This is called ""credentialing"" and it seems to be one of the more arcane parts of running a clinic. I have doctor friends who tell me they have no idea how they ended up in [insert random company nobody has heard of]'s network.  It seems that there are provider organizations that serve to get their members signed up with as many companies as possible, for better or worse. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  I then was out of the country for a month, and by the time I returned, the enrollment window had closed.

There is no enrollment window for Medicaid...  It's rolling enrollment.  You can apply anytime throughout the year and receive coverage if you are eligible.    "
HealthInsurance,"Lol i think its more ignorance than paranoia. She likely didnt know she was essentially walking into an ER and assumed it was just a fancy urgent care. "
HealthInsurance,"Gaps are not uncommon, but you can also elect COBRA and it should apply retroactively. 

Even if you had coverage, no one would generally expect you to pay a hospital bill within 60 days. It generally takes 3-6 weeks to get all the billing done anyway, especially when dealing with a hospital where there will be multiple EOB's and physicians. Relax. Even if you get into an emergency you won't be on the hook for some 200k bill. "
HealthInsurance,No problem! I can't seem to find an HSA with a 100% RX benefit in your county.  I'm assuming this is an individual plan?  There are several bronze plans available.  What's the deductible and what website are you using to apply for coverage?
HealthInsurance,"Almost all plans I've seen require that you provide two forms of verification. For a spouse, commonly it is the marriage license and proof of current marital status, such as the tax return showing both partners names, lease, current utility bill, etc. The guidelines usually suggest blacking out the financial information, which I think is reasonable. Providing a tax return or other financial document is quite routine. "
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"That is definitely a more accurate statement, yeah. I forgot sometimes that the representative sample of callers is not the representative sample of clients."
HealthInsurance,"It's kinda baffling that the PPO is less expensive than the HSA plan.  Based on the info you gave, it seems like the PPO plan is the best option.  The max out-of-pocket is only $500 more than the HSA plan, and I'm guessing the difference in premiums will make up for that."
HealthInsurance,"So we weren't legally allowed to bypass the insurance company as we decided in the 1st visit?

We had agreed to pay the cash price, so in my opinion the visits should not have been submitted to insurance in the first place..."
HealthInsurance,"You need to report an income change as soon as it happens. They will find out eventually, and they can actually clawback benefits from you, essentially, pulling them back the next time you actually need them. Let them know."
HealthInsurance,"haha no worries. Thanks and congrats on the new job! "
HealthInsurance,"If you could change your plan at any point of time in the year, everybody would elect for the cheapest plan with high deductible until shit hit the fan and then they'd just switch to the more expensive plan with the least out of pocket expenses.  The insurance system would collapse as nobody would be paying into it at a higher level until absolutely necessary.  

If you lose your job, the plan offered by your job is no longer available (unless you elect COBRA coverage).  Therefore, there's no other choice but to enroll in other coverage through a special enrollment period.  "
HealthInsurance,"No I’m not familiar with this. I’ll check it out. 

Edit: whoa this is very helpful. Looking at ankle foot orthosis and it has list of requirements to get it covered as well as a list of icd 10 codes that would cover it!  That’s awesome. May not have labs but at least it will help me with some devices and DMEs. Thank you!!!!"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the advice!  I'll look into it. "
HealthInsurance,Why are you speculating as to what your costs would be instead of reading the plan documents and finding out and comparing them to those of marketplace plans?
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Yep. Some auto insurers won’t pay primary if your health insurance will pay primary

What? If its an auto accident then the auto is primary. This much is pretty black and white. If the health insurance paid primary then i can guarantee once they figure out there was auto coverage they will take all their payments back and tell the hospitals to bill the auto insurance."
HealthInsurance,"The answer to your questions are dependent on the specific plan details of the options at work. You should be provided those details. 

Unless you have a qualifying life event to open a special enrollment period, you likely can't access anything on the marketplace. 

You can't be denied for preexisting conditions on ACA compliant healthcare plans, however. "
HealthInsurance,"yeah.  you might get some income subsidy back if you overestimated your income...But yeah, the market's a mess, although NY isn't as bad as other states."
HealthInsurance,Who's your insurer and what state do you live in?
HealthInsurance,What state do you live in?  What's your income?
HealthInsurance,"Illinois, combined income is about $90K.  It might sound like a decent income, but after student loan payments, it is not."
HealthInsurance,They told me last night when I called that divorce does not qualify unless In lost my insurance due to the divorce.
HealthInsurance,"Traditionally you'd have had to submit a gap exemption appeal first, and then have your procedure authorized. 

If you went out of network, and then continued to have the procedure after being told they had not received a pre-auth, that was mistake #1. There's no requirement of an out of network physician to have your appointment authorized, as a contracted in network provider would be as a condition of their contract. 

By all means certainly appeal, but a pre-auth alone usually isn't enough to get an out of network approved. Pre-auth is for the procedure itself. The network adequacy/gap exemption is what makes an out of network provider considered in network for you. "
HealthInsurance,A very amusing (/s) thing my company did was add a penalty for filling at your local pharmacy instead of using the mail order pharmacy we contract with. We would let you get 2 refills then it would jump in price unless you switched to mail order or called us and opted out. Might be something dumb like that.
HealthInsurance,What State do you live in?  What's your estimated income for the year?
HealthInsurance,"CHIP is Medicaid. Medicare is the one you get for age (65+), disability, or end stage renal disease. Aid for the needy, care for the elderly."
HealthInsurance,"There would have to be a claim first (for an eligible service).  Does Premera have a claim?  If so, what happened with it?
"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you!  It does!  When you mention the savings card, do you mean individual manufacturer cards, or one of those savings cards you can pretty much find anywhere that claims to save you ""up to 75%""?  I always thought the latter was somehow a scam hah, but when I was on vyvanse many moons ago and it wasn't covered, the company who made vyvanse, (Shire) offered a pharmacy discount card.  Just trying to figure out which route to take, and appreciate this!  Yeah, I can actually ONLY use Walgreens.  No place else.  My plan is $405 a month and I can only be covered at ONE pharmacy... asinine. "
HealthInsurance,"this right here, OP - KFF is about as authoritative as you can get outside of the feds' Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). Plus, so much easier to use than fed gov't data sources!

But one caution: KFF employer sponsored health plans data, and most people covered by employer-sponsored coverage are not in fully insured plans - so the ""premium"" costs are not ""truly"" premium costs.

Confused yet? Next we'll cover how maximum annual out-of-pocket limits don't actually limit a covered person's out-of-pocket expenses to the stated maximum dollar amounts."
HealthInsurance,Nope.  This is incorrect.
HealthInsurance,"Yes it ended 1/31. I am going there now, and will see what I can find."
HealthInsurance,"Yes, especially for spinal conditions (neck, back pain) with no red flag neurological symptoms. "
HealthInsurance,"You won't find any insurance at that price to get you out of paying the tax penalty. If you just want coverage, you could just get a short term plan that has to be renewed every 3 months. If your main concern is getting out of the tax penalty, Christian Health Care ministries will get you out of it for $45 a month. However, it is not real insurance. As a health advisor, I don't recommend it on a normal basis, but if you just want to get out of the tax penalty and still stay under $70, CHM might be your best option. Lets just hope nothing major happens to you if you choose that option."
HealthInsurance,"Who is your insurance provider?  Anthem, for example, defines an ""emergency"" differently than the ACEP. That may be why and if that's the case, you could try to appeal. As far as avoiding it in the future, there's not much you can do except check with the nurse hotline prior to going to the ER.  If they tell you to go, the insurance will almost always cover as an emergency regardless of the diagnosis on the submitted claim.  If you're too out of it to call then it's probably safe to assume it's a real emergency condition. If you do call and they say it's not an emergency, but you still feel like it's an emergency or just want to err on the side of caution, at least you'll be prepared for them to make the same type of decision.  (Personally, I would appeal this type of decision across the board. I don't have any conditions which might cause me to go to the ER very often but heart palipitations and PVC's sound pretty emergent to me.) 

ETA: Just a note about getting refered to the ED from your primary physician doesn't always mean there's an emergency. Sometimes they just don't have the time to effectively rule out an emergent condition so they send you to be safe. For example,  if you call your doc up at 5PM on a Friday you're more likely to get referred than if it were 1 PM on a Tuesday.

HealthInsurance,"Does he qualify for Medicaid anymore? For example household income. He has to report any changes to Medicaid. "

HealthInsurance,"Yes, COBRA premiums can be paid from an HSA. Generally, health insurance premiums cannot be paid from an HSA. Exceptions are granted if if you are collecting federal or state unemployment benefits, or you have COBRA continuation coverage through a former employer."
HealthInsurance,"It does make compete sense thank you! I'm going to give them a call tomorrow to see what they say and I have the location to a few sites ready should I have to hand them in personally.

/e. There was just some confusing information on the notice they sent saying I can still hand in the renewal by the date posted on the page above which I could still turn it in which is either May 15 or Mar 8 which I missed. "
HealthInsurance,"Contact your state’s Medicaid ASAP—-typically they will fast track an infant’s enrollment.

HealthInsurance,"Because of the ACA pre-existing conditions aren't an obstacle - It's the same price no matter your health.  Even if you were willing to pay a premium you can't enroll outside of the open enrollment period with a qualifying event (Job loss, move, having a baby, etc.)."
HealthInsurance,"In order to enroll outside of open enrollment you'll need a qualifying event - Did you recently move, lose coverage, have a baby, etc?"
HealthInsurance,"Oh trust me I know it makes no difference when the money is collected in regards to the insurance and processing the claim. But I’ve just seen too many situations where people pay up front and then they get a bill from the provider that is equal to the charge, not  the difference. 

It’s at least good to know why providers charge up front."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; We both obviously understand what an HSA qualifying plan entails and requires no further discussion.

Well, maybe a teensy bit. ;-) see your previous reply....

I'm with  you - we're essentially in violent agreement. But, since we aren't face to face &amp; able to communicate in gesture, expression, tone of voice, we're stuck with inadequate old words to sort out the detour we took here.

Happily, discussion's what we *do* here ;-D"
HealthInsurance,"""naturopath""  Unless it's from a PCP it's not going to happen.  Insurance doesn't cover naturopaths unless they are also PCPs, and if they're white label prescribing, it's unlikely.  However, if it's an actual prescription, and not just something from ""natural vegan super extra crunchy hippie whole foods"" written by an actual PCP that is formulary or formulary adjacent, then probably yes.  "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; The doctor treating her was peeved.

But not peeved enough to insist that the hospital triage people like pregnancy test woman away from their doors, because how else would peeved doctor get paid?

HealthInsurance,"Absolutely not true when going out of network.  The out of pocket expense to the patient when going out of network is unlimited, in all cases."
HealthInsurance,"No it’s fine. They work in the industry so they must know. But that isn’t the experience I’ve ever had, and unfortunately I can’t go back in time and show you my real time deductible/OOP for those two instances. I’ll yield to the experts. "
HealthInsurance,This is more of an IRS/tax accountant question than a health insurance question.  You may be better served asking an accountant.
HealthInsurance,"Seconding this if a car was involved (though it wasn't mentioned). Similarly if it happened at work file a workers comp claim.

However if neither of these apply the best move you can make is to talk to your insurance company and let them know your situation, they tend to be more willing to work with patients if, along with filling out the proper form, you call in and talk to someone to explain your case. I've seen patients rack up huge bills for surgeries and office visits, pay cash, then decide to get insurance after the fact and we ended up refunding them. Just letting you know it IS possible."
HealthInsurance,"This isn't particularly uncommon - It's personally happened to me a number of times - You can try quite a few different things:

1) Write a letter to the Appeals and Grievances address (Usually found on your EOB)

2) Contact them via social media (Whether by posting directly on their page or messaging them)

3) Write a letter/email to their CEO or one of their executives/board members

4) If all else fails contact your state Department of Insurance or Insurance Commissioner 

Also - What state do you live in?  Is the insurance through your work or the exchange?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; f you mom’s plan is a plan that offers a National Network, then there should not be any issues.

you mean any issues other than that out-of-network care for dad might cost a bunch more
"
HealthInsurance,"Key words from response “cost less to the insurance company”. My suggestions reach out to the mri provider and inquire on cash pay price without insurance. You would be suprised the cost compared to what you have already paid. Insurance providers are trying to save themselves money not what is best for the patients. 

I completed 12 sessions of pt therapy for a cervical spine issue, my copay was 60 a visit and the insurance paid an entire 7 per visit. This was on top of my 8500. 00 per year premiums. Insurance companies are there to make money not help you. Do some research and ask for out of pocket prices from providers you would be amazed at how much you will save. "
HealthInsurance,"Yea, something's not right here.

stuff like location (city, state), expected annual income, age, will help generate actionable info

COBRA election period is 60 days from date of receipt of COBRA eligibility, so you have time to make the choice. [Walkthru of a COBRA bridge strategy here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/)"

HealthInsurance,"It's friendly snark.  Or, as friendly as /r/realanceps ever gets.  :-p"
HealthInsurance,"So it isn’t possible to have a Medicaid policy together? That’s what I’ve been confused about; whether we would qualify for Medicaid jointly or if we’d need to shop around. Unfortunately I can’t stay on my mom’s policy for too much longer so that’s not really an option, and I feel like marriage makes the most sense for our situation, but thank you for your input!"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks! I will let the COBRA thing expire if nothing expensive happens, and hope I find a dang job soon. "
HealthInsurance,"yeah, what I'm saying is that that's  not how COBRA works. or ACA."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah I applied via healthcare.gov, I have pictures of what they were asking of me if you want me to attach them. I’m on my way home from class right now so I can do that shortly l-

HealthInsurance,Some state Medicaid programs cover harvoni. It was around 100k/treatment when i was seeing approvals. Free to the member. Not sure if its still that much
HealthInsurance,"I'm not familiar with unemployment and Medicaid being connected, but Medicaid rules/laws/regulations vary by state. So which state are you asking about?"
HealthInsurance,"Insurers will be taken down for this overreaching bs one day, perhaps soon. People will cease to put up with it. Employers who are self-funding benefit programs should not abdicate common sense decisions to their insurer/administrators"
HealthInsurance,"I have and their answer is usually vague and not surprising clear "
HealthInsurance,"1. I am not sure if it was out of network to be honest.

2. Here are all the letters/documents: *removed*

3. Yes, I did have insurance at the date of incident."
HealthInsurance,"Government operated v private operated.  Costs are the same, just differently administered.  Go with blue cross."
HealthInsurance,"Are you sure about the math on the penalty? My understanding was that if you go over the ""grace period"" for being without coverage, the penalty is based on the entire time you were without coverage, not just the amount over 3 months."
HealthInsurance,"They aren’t charging you extra. You’re getting the normal cost. Those that participate get a discounted/preferred rate. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Ok, that makes sense I guess. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; think HSA coverage

No, don't think HSA coverage. Think HDHP coverage. The High Deductible Health Plan is the insurance part, with the, y'know, high deductibles &amp; stuff. The Health Savings Account is the ""options package"", a tax-favored way to, if you choose, pay the high deductibles your HDHP imposes.

OP, PG's right that you can't be discriminated against based on use of your medication. Depending on the state where your little firm is, the impact on their renewal rates of your medication cost may be big, or small, or other. Might an adversely impacted employer go to the trouble of trying to track down why their renewal rates spiked, regardless the legal barriers? It could happen. Could that firm then take discriminatory action against you? Again, pretty unlikely. Could you put a world of hurt on them, assuming you could make a tight case they acted against you based on your medication use? Oh, yes."
HealthInsurance,"With a lot of plans, therapy is based on medical necessity, with no visit limit. Ask if there are any excluded, or non covered diagnosis codes. 

Ive seen some claims denied when the primary diagnosis code is ADHD or Autism. (Not every plan, but better to ask so you know if your plan excludes it)

If they ask you for CPT codes (procedure codes the office will bill for reimbursement) ask what the coverage is for the following codes: 90791, 90792, 90837. Or an office visit with therapy (99213 and 90833 for example) 

I bill for multiple therapists and those are some of the commonly used codes. Each provider bills differently based on the service provided. "
HealthInsurance,When was your open enrollment?
HealthInsurance,"OP - you're getting a lot of bad information from several posters.

If you have any doubts, contact your insurer and ask them about using out of network providers, allowed amounts, and how balance billing works."
HealthInsurance,You should have an out of pocket maximum.  The co insurance does seem a bit high but that might be because there is no deductible (high co-ins offset by the fact that you don't need to meet a deductible).  Was this diagnostic bloodwork or was this for preventive services?
HealthInsurance,"who are you, &amp; what do you mean?"
HealthInsurance,"Oh okay, that makes sense. Thank you!"
HealthInsurance,"Charlotte, NC"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I have super excellent dental insurance (best you can buy - $20,000 annual maximum (yes all those zeros)

TWENTY thousand, or TWO thousand? I've never heard of dental coverage with an annual maximum that high. Ever. 

Source: in the health benefits business a looooong time. But I'm surprised almost every day by stuff I've never seen!"
HealthInsurance,"Hey thanks a lot man. So my parents live in Missouri, and I live in Texas, are you saying that if he moves to Texas with me that he'd be able to still use my mom's insurance?? "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the advice.  We decided to go with 350--250 to cover deductible (which will probably be used up with chiropractor visits), and the rest either for co-pays or to roll over."
HealthInsurance,"Exactly this. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; if it isn’t collected up front, 80-90% of patient balances are never paid.

I'm not doubting you - but instead suggesting that that 10-20% of instances  may be the OP's negotiation zone. 


Maybe not in Texas, which, no offense to you, I have found to be a health care &amp; coverage hellhole - but in the rest of the civilized United States, clinicians and facilities are not always so draconian"
HealthInsurance,"uh, you probably meant to correspond with OP, not a broker...but you won't want to do that 1st thing either, since soliciting here is not cool...."
HealthInsurance,"Please note that if your provider has a contact with your insurance company - they are legally required to bill your insurance even if you ask for self pay. "
HealthInsurance,"100/month, 500 deductible, 10% coinsurance and 1k oopm."
HealthInsurance,"Also, figure out who the ""financial counselor"" or ""financial advisor"" is where ever he gets treatment and set up a meeting with them. Don't be afraid to ask them blunt questions, leave them voicemails, or send them emails. They can incredible resources, but remember that they are overworked and underpaid. Gifts like cookies or thank you notes are always appreciated. My mom worked as one for years."
HealthInsurance,"plus would be passing up a potentially useful revenue stream

Simplest for you would be to have any insured contact their insurer to confirm coverage. Have them ask just that way, then ask for written confirmation. That is, your clients should frame their question assuming coverage, &amp; have their insurer's customer service staff confirm their response - in either direction - in writing, or with  link to a supporting document"
HealthInsurance,"It doesn't. I don't understand what all is going on but after an hour on the phone with BCBS it looks like the doctor's office has been over billing me. The BCBS rep called their office and spoke with them and told them they owe me some money back and I told them to bill everything through BCBS first. For instance BCBS is showing I was to be billed $103 for a visit and I paid $260. They showed I was to be billed $512.43 and instead was billed $610.00.  Luckily I have all the receipts. "
HealthInsurance,"Oh my, this is going to make me want to cry. It was a literally less than 5 minute visit for the physician to tell me to take 2 meds for reducing inflammatory in a cyst. So, I'm wondering if these costs are reasonable? Like if I was charged for a full daily-room rate, (according to an article).


This EOB shows $154 then $139.10: https://imgur.com/a/eakro

So I think I'm at... $694.80, $139.10, $113.36
Total: $947.26

Oh my."

HealthInsurance,"&gt;I'd go to www.healthcare.gov and apply for coverage.

HealthInsurance,"Undocumented immigrants can buy off-Marketplace qualified health plans (the same plans that are available on-Marketplace). However they don’t qualify for subsidies, and you can’t get subsidies off-Marketplace anyway, so they have to pay full freight for it. "
HealthInsurance,"Do you pay a contribution for your enrollment in your employer's plan? If so, given you just signed up, they may give you a bit of administrative grace to rescind that election - that is, if you ARE required to contribute and don't want the additional coverage. If that's your situation &amp; they have any sense, they'll work with you to accomplish that."
HealthInsurance,"Outside open enrollment you can’t just buy insurance. You need to have a special enrollment qualification such as moving, losing coverage, or other life change. 

You can get short term health insurance but they cover little and don’t cover pre-existing conditions so read the contract before assuming it’ll cover you in this situation. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; That's ridiculous

Not just ridiculous - unlawful. penalties might be applied, if OP were inclined to pursue....."
HealthInsurance,"I think “no deductible” means you don’t have to reach your deductible to get coverage, not that your OOP expenses won’t count toward your deductible. I think they would count toward your deductible. "
HealthInsurance,"It’s not uncommon for people going on COBRA  to still even have their routine visits. If your doctor or hospital uses real time eligibility checkers, they will likely receive a response from the insurance company saying your coverage has termed. If you inform them of your status with just enrolling in cobra, they will either: A. Understand and still let you proceed with your visit (in this case it’s important you know for certain your cobra is active) or B. Ask for a small deposit towards your visit or procedure and will then refund it or put the deposit towards any outstanding balance. 

Eventually, the insurance will start returning “active/eligible” in the real time eligibility responses. It will often take 3-5 weeks for this to happen  "
HealthInsurance,Damn. Either way thank you very much for your contribution man. I appreciate the answers
HealthInsurance,No problem. Here to help :)
HealthInsurance,"Other poster has provided most info you need. Unless you get assistance, you won’t find what you need for $200/mo IMO. Depending on your employers contribution strategy and the benefits sponsored, you could find something at that level.

For your Rx’s, you may want to request a copy of each carrier formulary/PDL to make sure the drugs you need are covered at all, regardless of the requirement to try generics/lower cost meds first. On day one of coverage, you’ll want to start the prior authorization process for any needed drugs. Make sure you have a good supply before starting this coverage. This could take from one to several weeks to complete, depending on the information submitted by your doc and the plan requirements/coverage."
HealthInsurance,"I only use the kind that come straight from the manufacturer. It’s also worth calling your doctors office if you can’t find anything online because they tend to keep them in their office as well. I’ve called my insurance before and waited through the process of trying to figure out wether my prescription was covered or not since they change it so frequently, but usually there’s always an answer. The very last step would be filing an appeal with your insurance which takes a few weeks, but I’ve never had to do that. If you have trouble finding a savings card for the exact medication, you’re more than welcome to PM me. I know how annoying and stressful it is when you’re stuck in this situation. Good luck! "
HealthInsurance,"Hmm that's odd, you should be able to enroll in Medicaid year-round. Maybe NY has different rules... What does it say in your notice in terms of your options? Does your income still qualify you for Medicaid? 
Can you get onto your parents' health insurance, if they have any? "
HealthInsurance,Stay unmarried is probably your best option.
HealthInsurance,"Oh, it's cool, it happens.

I responded to this before, but it doesn't look like the employer contributes at all. I think the reason for the plan being like that has something to do with my employer entirely covering the coinsurance? But even that doesn't make sense in my head (then again, I'm not entirely certain what co-insurance even means)."
HealthInsurance,LlamaBiscuits is correct - The coordination of benefits is determined by state law or your contract.  The medication issue is something separate - It's most likely a non-formulary medication or a step-therapy or prior authorization requirement.  Is there anyway you can tell us what medication she's trying to get and what state you live in?
HealthInsurance,"Well, shortly after we stopped seeing the provider he decided to go out-of-network with our insurance. So I doubt they'll ever find out.

So what incentive did the provider have to submit the claims to insurance when we had agreed to the cash payments? Was he waiting until I met my deductible and then he'd get paid twice for the same service? (Which was exactly what happened until I ruined it for him...)"
HealthInsurance,"Alternatively you can also try buying a policy directly the BCBS of Kansas - I went through their quote process and the only available start date was 4/1 - So you may be able to buy a policy that would start in April.  The only problem is that you won't qualify for any financial assistance.  This policy has the lowest deductible and out of pocket maximum - It's premium is about $380.00 a month.

http://www.bcbsks.com/HealthPlans/sbc-index.htm?py=2018&amp;sb=s&amp;hi=18558KS0400001-00

I would call them to confirm the April start date though.  Their numver for enrollnent services is 785-291-4304."
HealthInsurance,"Hopefully they have a reinstatement policy and you can just pay up and move on.

Unfortunately, if they don't, or if you are outside of the reinstatement guidelines, you may just be stuck without insurance for the rest of the year. It is ultimately your responsibility to make sure your premium is paid.

If they refuse reinstatement you can try filing a [complaint](https://apps.fldfs.com/eService/Default.aspx) with the FL Department of Insurance. 

I cannot see how legal representation would do anything but lose you money at this point, but if you feel like you need to go that route the FL Bar Association has a [lawyer referral service](https://www.floridabar.org/public/lrs/)."
HealthInsurance,When did you lose coverage?  What's your estimated income?
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  no government regulation defines ""high deductible""

We agree that, narrowly, the feds don't define ""high deductible"" in isolation. 

However, Section 223(c)(2) of the *Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003* - y'know, the law that brought HSAs, and HDHPs, into existence - DOES define ""high deductible"" in its role as an element of what constitutes a qualifying High Deductible Health Plan - which is a very specific thing indeed, and entails more than merely how high its deductible is.
"
HealthInsurance,"Think about it. your phone, your gym membership - those businesses **want** *you to use their products/services*. 

Health insurers promise to pay a large fraction of health treatment charges YOU CAN'T AFFORD. Your coverage is a risk they - whoever is covering you as a dependent - would prefer not to have. 

As others have noted, ACA EXPANDED the obligation of plans to extend coverage to dependent children.

And no, auto insurance is not like health insurance - your driving experience impacts your parrents' premium payments for you. Your health treatment ""experience"" doesn't impact your parents' premiums for covering you as a dependent (if they cover you under a marketplace policy, ""thanks Obama"" - if by employer-sponsored coverage, you can thank that employer, too)"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I couldn't get a plan on the exchange

In my area there is no difference between plans on or off of the exchange.  There is only one company (Blue Cross) that offers individual coverage.  They offer several different types of plans but they have the same coverage and terms regardless of whether you buy them on or off the exchange.  No other company offers individual coverage here (county in northern Chicago suburbs)

"
HealthInsurance,"In my state, or at least for the county I live in, there is only one insurance company selling individual coverage.  That is Blue Cross and they offer the same coverage plans through both the Obamacare Online Marketplace and direct.  The same rules apply to both avenues of purchase although I believe you can only qualify for Federal tax credits if you buy through the Marketplace.    

You can only enroll during the open enrollment period which is at the end of the year for coverage beginning January 1 unless you qualify for a special enrollment period due to a [qualifying life event](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/).  Generally, losing coverage due to loss of a job or a job change would usually qualify you but there are rules and a limited period to do this."
HealthInsurance,Ugh I see that doesn't apply until 2019. Guess I'm screwed if I do and screwed if I don't.
HealthInsurance,"Just passing on what I was told. I have Allstate. They asked me after enrolling whether my health insurance would pay primary in an auto accident. I wasn’t sure. We had a 3-way conference call through some conferencing service they use for this purpose. On the phone call, my health insurance said they did not pay primary, so Allstate had to, and I got an extra fee on my Allstate premium because of it. If my health insurance had answered that they (health insurance) did pay primary, Allstate said they (Allstate) would not. 

What the health insurance company does after a claim, if they are the primary payer, that is not something I have any knowledge about. "
HealthInsurance,"Hi! Nope you can only contribute to an HSA pre-tax if your employer has one set up (with their own HDHP plan).  You cannot contribute pre-tax to your wife's account because you do not work for her employer.  

You CAN contribute post tax and take the tax deduction at the end of the year.  Instead of doing this, another option is that she increase her payroll contribution to the HSA and you reimburse her. Assuming you file joint taxes at the end of the year."
HealthInsurance,I feel your pain and I am anxiously waiting for someone knowledgeable to help with your question.
HealthInsurance,"I'm a licensed health advisor and I might be able to offer some insight, but I need a little information first. 

What state are you in?
What insurance company does your work use? "
HealthInsurance,"Assuming you're truly in a catastrophic plan, you don't need a tax form. The Marketplace is correct that they don't issue 1095-As for catastrophic plans. Insurers aren't required to issue 1095-Bs for them (some do so as a courtesy), but you don't need the form to file your taxes -- 1095-B forms are for your records only. To file your taxes you just attest that you have coverage, you don't need proof.

See https://acatimes.com/irs-extends-voluntary-reporting-of-catastrophic-coverage/ for a bit of background..."
HealthInsurance,Is it? I think she was also unnecessarily rude. ����‍♂️
HealthInsurance,"Call the office, tell them your problem and ask if there is an additional charge for a follow up on the work they've done."
HealthInsurance,"Well, I'm a mod and I make that call. You are a rude ungrateful person who is searching for an offense to take. I'm locking this thread."
HealthInsurance,"Not covered.  "
HealthInsurance,Last year I made $20k. I own a business so it’s tough to say how much I’ll make this year. Maybe 20-30k. I live in Kansas. I’m 27.
HealthInsurance,"I've had this happen several times and luckily there was always a way to work around it. Even if costs lower than $50 I was able to find a savings card online for almost everything. Sometimes it's also because you're using the wrong pharmacy. I have Florida blue as well and I can only use Walgreens, Walmart or Sams club (which just shut down). It's incredibly annoying and stressful and im not sure what steps you've already taken, but I'd try looking for savings cards online. I think I've probably had one medication ever that I couldn't find a savings card for and it was an extremely expensive antibiotic. I've had pharmacies tell me before that I need to actually print it out and drop it off while others have taken the information over the phone as soon as I finished signing up. I just had this happen with my 6MP prescription when they told me that it was coming back priced at like $650 when it was always free before. I ended up using the specialty pharmacy through Walgreens and it went down to $2. I really hope this helps. "
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Congratulations to you both!! :)

The ACA (""Obamacare"") expanded maternity coverage to a lot of people, but plans that were ""grandfathered in"" (unfortunately) typically don't include maternity coverage. This usually includes both employer sponsored-dependent coverage and student insurance.  The ACA blocks insurers from denying insurance based on pre-existing conditions (believe it or not, pregnancy used to fall under that). So you should be able to purchase a plan to cover the gap (AKA a supplemental policy).  Being pregnant qualifies your wife for enrollment after the open enrollment, so you should also look into plans available in your area (here: https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/)
 
It's unlikely that any new plan will retroactively pay those past claims*, and those payments won't go towards a deductible.
For those bills, you should try to explain the situation / ask the billing office of your OB for a self-pay discount and/or a low/no-interest payment plan.

HealthInsurance,"&gt;  As a gambler, you are self-employed. Most people submitting applications for income based on their gross income.

Gross income for the previous year or expected income for the current year? It would seem ridiculous to for the insurance agencies to assume equal year-to-year profits, especially on gross income which ignores business deductions.

I am aware of the filing requirements for professional gamblers, however in 2017, my unearned income from capital gains vastly exceeded my earned income from gambling. 

I will PM you some numbers. Thank you"
HealthInsurance,"I’m sorry that your son is going through this and you have to deal with insurance garbage when you could be spending time with your son. I don’t mean that in a parent-shaming way. I mean that your son needs your attention and now you have to worry about exorbitant medical bills. Not cool. I hope he gets the help he needs. "
HealthInsurance,"Health care is vital. Health *insurance* is... another thing. 

Its financial aspects are kinda-sorta routine: [here's a very basic model for comparing the financial aspects of available policies](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif). 

Another element on which people compare plans is the flexibility plan offers in selecting clinicians and treatment facilities without financial penalty. That, in a nutshell, is the difference between Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) designs. Oversimplifying, the latter covers some or all of costs you incur when you obtain treatment or medications from the plan's network of doctors, hospitals and drugstores - and nothing of the bills from NON-network sources. PPOs provide more generous benefits for bills you incur from network providers, but some level of benefits if you use non-network providers.

Most people, most years, are mostly as healthy as they're capable of being; charges for their health treatment are not breathtakingly high. Of course, knowing whether you'll be ""most people"" months in the future is hard  - no, it's not possible. Your comfort with making forecast like that willl play a big role in your comfort selecting a plan that steers you to particular doctors &amp; hospitals (&amp; so away from others)"
HealthInsurance,"I'm not sure - was just thinking you may have documentation showing you thought it was an emergency that way. "
HealthInsurance,"Did you find a plan through the exchange? It's that why your premium went up? Or is it affecting all plans?

HealthInsurance,"I’d assume your combined incomes [married] would price you out of Medicaid eligibility. "
HealthInsurance,"When was your last day with coverage? "
HealthInsurance,"Ok! I'd talk to her tax advisor about the implications of the company paying for her insurance. Also, in most states the individual plans are worse and more expensive than group plans."
HealthInsurance,"She doesn't get to pick which plan was primary while she was covered by two plans. The claims need to be filed to the plan she had with her employer when the services were rendered first, then they can be filed to her father's plan as the secondary insurance. They were right to go back and deny those claims.

The medication is a totally separate issue. Why are they saying she can't get them?"
HealthInsurance,"Well maybe I have just gotten lucky or gotten bad information from every single insurance company I’ve had in the last 30 years, but my balance billed amount has always been added to my out of pocket max. 
Case in point: the ambulance situation first billed me out of network and was completely counted by my out of network deductible at 1200$ with insurance not discounting it or covering a damned penny. 

The same thing happened with a previous in-network provider that billed out of network after my appt because they’d been bought by someone else. I hadn’t met my deductible so insurance only paid about 200$. The remaining 400$ was balance billed and included in my out of network deductible. 

I’ll believe what you’re saying, but in ALL of my personal experiences with several different insurances companies, I’ve always seen my balance billed amount for out of network expenses included in my deductible and out of pocket max. "

HealthInsurance,"Hunting around on Google, it seems that non-resident aliens such as short-term J1 visa holders are not included in the Affordable Care Act's requirements to get insurance that covers pre-existing conditions, therefore few do.

Prior to  ACA/""Obamacare"", nearly every policy did not cover pre-existing conditions, and not reporting pre-existing conditions (either intentionally or accidentally) was grounds for termination of the insurance policy.  Even if what you were being treated for has nothing to do with the pre-exisiting condition.  (Search Google for ""insurance recission cancer"" for plenty of articles with examples.)

Personally, I would consider reporting these conditions in order to comply with the requirements.  You can look at https://www.goodrx.com/ to compare cash prices for your medications from various pharmacies.  Read through https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm484154.htm if you're tempted to bring a supply from home. There's a number of requirements that your medication must meet in order for you to bring it here even for your own personal use.  Even with that I would probably not attempt to bring a large supply of Xanax through customs."
HealthInsurance,"Denver, 25, I wasn't denied Medicaid-- I was determined eligible but every time I tried to contact them they did not get back to me.

HealthInsurance,"I would do just that - Schedule an appointment ASAP and let your current insurance handle it.  There are certain things insurers are required to cover called ""Essential Health Benefits"" - That and as long as you see  in-network providers your costsx will never exceed $7,150."

According to the letter I literally made $110 over what is allowed for me to be insured under her plan since I am 18+. 
I’m going to try and drop a day at work for a month or two and see if we can appeal it, because the money I’ve been stocking in savings is basically going to stop being added to if I get insurance through work, as I wouldn’t have the extra. It would take up a big chunk of my pay checks. "

HealthInsurance,Good
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! I never thought about using an HSA/FSA. I’ll look into it! "
HealthInsurance,This broker 100% agrees with the first comment
HealthInsurance,"Sounds like you've gotten set on the PPO, which given your financial situation from other comments sounds correct for the moment. I'd recommend asking if your FSA option includes a grace period OR a rollover benefit. If the latter, you'll be able to roll over $500/year, thus allowing you to stash away $500 of pretax dollars and take advantage of the cheapest premium option. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes!! File a grievance!! Anytime there is an issue with a Medicare provider, file!  They will stop in their tracks. "

Thankfully I knew of an awesome private insurance company I was able to get with because I am self employed.

HealthInsurance,"My personal two cents is to grab the HSA plan and put as much money as you can reasonably afford in it. I would go so far as to suggest even foregoing setting up a retirement plan to put more money in your HSA.

Reasons whyL

1) You are young, therefore you are unlikely to have many expenses. For a PPO plan, this just means you don't pay any money. For an HSA plan, you are rewarded for not being sick/being young, as your money accumulates.

2) Investing - instead of just being a lump of cash you stash away for a rainy day, you can invest these funds in stable mutual funds. I always work to have a $2000 ""ready"" to be used, but then automatically invest any dollars after the $2K mark. This allows your money to earn money, which is a big incentive given your age.

3) The HSA Plan is the only method in the US Tax Code that gets you pre-tax benefits three times. Once is when you earn the money, you pay less taxes from your pay check. Second is when your investments earn money, this is tax free (you usually have to pay taxes on earned money). Third is when you pull the money out. Compare that with investing the money in the stock market - you pay taxes when you make the money from your pay check and every dime you make when you sell your investment is taxed. Or compare it with a 401K, which is pre-tax from your paycheck, but then you pay taxes when you pull it out (or an IRA, where you pay taxes now and then get it tax free when you pull it out). No option allows you more tax savings than an HSA.

4) An HSA isn't just for medical expenses. Contrary to popular belief, once you hit age 65 and are Medicare eligible, you can use your money for anything. You will have to pay income taxes if the expense is not for medical expenses, but at that point it is operating no differently than a 401K, but a 401K that also double as a massive medical expense safety net.

The PPO Plan you lay out here may be the better option month-to-month, but the HSA plan, if you fund it aggressively, is your best play by a long shot if you don't have regular medical expenses."

HealthInsurance,"Drug formulary lists are constantly changing, usually year to year to some degree. Your plan can remove a drug from the formulary, add drugs, change the requirements/medical necessity criteria for medications, and alter a medication tier during the plan year. Generally these changes won't affect you until the renewal of your plan following the change. The other notable exceptions are tiers can be changed in a plan year and affect you if a generic is released to the market. Or if you should've converted to a 90 day/mail order supply. "

HealthInsurance,"just a little tidbit of someone I know that married someone on medicaid, you cannot have much in assets at all, no savings at all, and make very little money also or they will not stay on medicaid.  It is your household income, so if you make a decent amount of money and ever want to save and have assets, get out from under the medicaid and get married and find outside insurance for both of you.  It's freeing to get rid of the medicaid and not feel controlled by them for everything.  But, it's also expensive too, but when I hear what others pay for insurance, we pay $835 a month for both of us now and really, knowing we can buy a house and have a savings account and not worry about making too much money is very freeing.  Also, being married is better for us too!!  Medicaid looks at the total income of the household, so if you make a lot of money (or even have a lot of money in accounts, no matter how you got them, i.e. inherited them even or own an expensive home), decide what's right for you, living free of medicaid and paying for your own insurance, or being stuck in the system and at the mercy of their requirements."
HealthInsurance,"I would avoid using an out-of-network provider unless you can afford to over half of the total charges ($50,000+) out of your own pocket.  And this is regardless of what your actual benefits (coinsurance, out of pocket max, etc.).

Your insurance is only going to cover up to their allowed amount and the provider (when out of network) is allowed to bill you for the rest.

For example:  Total charges = $100,000.  Insurance allowed amount might be only $60,000 (or less).  You insurance will only consider that $60,000 - applying your deductible and percentage against that amount.  The remaining $40,000 is totally on you.

If you were using an in network provider, the provider may not bill you for that remaining $40,000 and has to accept the insurance allowed amount ($60,000) as payment in full."

HealthInsurance,"You seem to be missing a lot of information. Someone else may correct me and I may be wrong but that age 26 is due to the affordable care act that forces insurance companies to let parents keep their children on their plans. This is to ensure that college students don't lose their health insurance right after graduating.

Insurance companies might want to kick children off their parents plans because it costs them more money. Since the child's health care costs are being footed by the parent they are more likely to go get health care. This costs Insurance companies more money. If the child had to foot the deductible than they probably would go as often."
HealthInsurance,"This is actually a great post, Juan. 

I'll add I bit, &amp; I'm sure others will soon have useful stuff to contribute

At root, health insurance - most insurance - is pretty simple.  What promises are you making for paying money to people who experience particular events? How many situations wll arise where you have to honor those promises in a given period of time?

There are hordes of professionals who've developed some pretty neat capabilities for defining those promises and forecasting their consequences reasonably accurately in dollars &amp; cents. You can hire them to do that for you! 

Of course you'd also need to be able to do things like forecast how many people would be interested in buying insurance policies that documented those promises you're making, and figure how much you'd need to charge to cover the costs of meeting those promises, and how much of that forecast would be made up of the cost to find them, and persuade them, and collect money from them, etc etc.

And then you'd also have to persuade regulators in whatever state(s) you want to sell your insurance policies that you're capable of honoring those promises, in bad times as well as good times. Health insurance is regulated at the state level. That's not a good idea - it's a big barrier to designing &amp; operating anything like systematic, equitable provision of health treatment for everyone in the US - but it's the way it is. 

And a lot of those rules have been in place for a long time, and were instituted there because the insurers operating there - not consumers, not doctors, not hospitals, not well-informed voters - wanted those rules to be in place there, mostly to protect them and their market share (look up ""regulatory capture"").

Some people will tell you you need legions of people to process claims for health treatment, claims, basically, against the promises you decided your health insurance company would stand behind. That used to be the case, but far fewer people are necessary for processing claims than were needed even 10  or 15 years ago. Computers! Heck, maybe even  Amazon - together with, say, Berkshire Hathaway,and JP Morgan Chase - could do it."

I asked my ob about the “medical necessity” exception and she said that just means the insurance company will subpoena my files and probably deny it anyway. But if you have some medical reason to justify an exception, maybe it’s worth a shot. Good luck. "
HealthInsurance,I'm in a self funded plan. It's the same plan as it was before it was self funded. It's even still administered by BCBS. You just need to check over your coverage documents carefully.
HealthInsurance,"I pay almost twice as much as you for a policy that has limited doctors (can't see the doctor I went to for 25 years) and a $7K deductible.

I too have about $2 to $3K of annual medical expenses, most of which don't get covered at all.

Unfortunately you can't look at the insurance as covering you current expenses, or that you would have saved $3K if you hadn't bought insurance.  The expensive insurance you have, like mine, is really kind of a catastrophic plan that provides some limited benefits for regular ongoing care.  The real benefit of your policy is protection from complete financial ruin if you were to have a catastrophic injury or illness.

I had heart surgery a few years ago and had over $300K of medical costs that year and only had to pay my max out of pocket for the year (which was under $4K that year).

These days medical costs are outrageous.  And a more serious broken limb might run many tens of thousands of dollars.  A problem resulting in a week or so of hospitalization and some surgery can easily go over $100K, and if you were to have a serious disease like some form of cancer it could escalate to many hundreds of thousands.  That is why you really need insurance."

Yes. ACA squashed pre-existing condition barriers, and that aspect of the law still stands - for now....

&gt;and if so would i just be working for the insurance and still not be able to support myself?

not sure exactly what you mean here. You'd be covered the same as anyone else eligible to enroll. Same contributions, same plan terms, etc.

If you are disabled severely enough to qualify for Social Security disability payments, you'll become eligible for Medicare coverage - but that's a ways into the future. Meanwhile, your other coverage options depend on things like where you are, what your  income might be, etc. Medicaid eligibility rules &amp; benefits vary from state to state."
HealthInsurance,"Other than something like moving, the only option I can see is a special enrollment period for [exceptional circumstances](https://www.healthcare.gov/sep-list/). As you can see, the description is ""You faced a serious medical condition or natural disaster that kept you from enrolling. For example: An unexpected hospitalization or temporary cognitive disability, or were otherwise incapacitated."" 

I am not sure the odds that would pan out, since it is your wife that has the medical condition, not you, but it's definitely worth a shot. Be sure to include any documentation you have.

If you want someone to help you fill out the paperwork, you can find local help [here](https://localhelp.healthcare.gov/#/).

Also, while it would be great if you can get insurance, there are still some options for getting you mental healthcare in the meantime. Texas has a mental health authority system that includes care for the uninsured. You can find your local mental health authority [here](http://www.dshs.texas.gov/mhservices-search/).

Commonly vision insurance has minimal benefits for lasik eye surgery. For dental and vision, you're probably better off negotiating a cash price with your provider. 

People sign up for insurance through the ACA because they are dissatisfied by the offering through their employer, spouse, or have no offerings through such. Could also just be cheaper depending on your market. 

&gt; also i have been forced to take various psychiatric drugs and attend various rehabs for cannabis use, which i have not really benefited from, and i have not been allowed to utilize a free market alternative medicine solution

That is entirely between you and your physician and has nothing to do with the healthcare plan you purchase.

HealthInsurance,"Congrats on your planned nuptials!

 a few semi-random thoughts on your situation:
 
You may stay on mom/dad's coverage until age 26, marriage or no marriage. Depending on your circumstances - of your health, your/fiance's expected income, place (city, state) - this may be your best economic bet, even if - as you should evaluate - you arrange to pay your folks whatever the contribution amount is required to maintain your coverage under that plan.

The devil is in your/fiance's ""local"" details. Your options, and their costs to you, depend a lot on those particulars. So tell us more!"
HealthInsurance,"hey there, this was me last year, just returned after traveling for 5 months in Asia. 

I would actually calculate your tax penalty first and see. You might find it to be cheaper than paying for premium you'll never use, depending on your income.  https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/estimator/isrp/"
HealthInsurance,What state are you in? You might qualify for Medicaid.
HealthInsurance,"Based on your post, it sounds like you're guessing you might have something but haven't been worked up for anything yet.  If you don't qualify for Medicaid, your best bet (in my opinion), would be an HMO or plan structured similar to one.  

They're usually more affordable than PPO's.  You'll need a referal for any specialized care but that can be a good thing if you're prone to any type of health anxiety / hypochondria.  More info can be found in these links.  Good luck! :)

HealthInsurance,"Good point I wasn't aware of that. "
HealthInsurance,Thank you!
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  I can't decline mental health coverage for no reason that I can comprehend

you can't comprehend because you don't insure events you can predict - and budget for. You don't KNOW you'll never need psychiatric care.

&gt;I can't decline maternity because if you're female and live in Texas, you have to have it. 

Actually, pretty much if you're human &amp; buying health insurance having any value in the United States, your insurance policy includes provision for maternity care. It isn't a Texas thing. Texas is an awful place to obtain health insurance, either as an individual or as a group - but not because coverage includes provision for maternity care.


&gt;So I have all this extra coverage that I'll never use 

Again. Never say never. Your purchase of insurance is a purchase of an insurer's promise to pay some or all of charges for treatments you mostly can't predict you'll need. It's not like a savings account in which the premiums you pay in are the sums you may withdraw.

HealthInsurance,"&gt;What I couldn’t figure out from the bridge strategy was whether I would suffer any consequences from my insurance lapsing, given my pre-existing conditions.

no, no consequence - PROVIDED you only use your ""COBRA hedge"" for that 2-month window, while you shop for a more economical and more long-term solution. 

&gt;I am not sure what your “what do I win?” Comment means in regards to my question. Since it’s reddit I’ll assume it’s snark :)

HealthInsurance,"Depends what the 'plus' is in your plan, but if the plan only covers preventive services and screenings then no, you're not covered for your knee pain."
HealthInsurance,"The cheaper plan might be a cheaper plan because it has a smaller network (like being an HMO vs a PPO).

This year just be really careful to stay in network.  Chalk it up to a valuable lesson to read the fine print.  Insurance won't let you just switch plans outside of enrollment without a special enrollment period because they would lose money.  People would just switch in an out of cheaper and more expensive plans when they needed them costing insurance companies more money."
HealthInsurance,You can choose to not to have a clinic bill your insurance.
HealthInsurance,"Interesting... Is there a link where I can read more information on fee forgiving?
Does it make a difference that my husband and I had no idea that he would report it to our insurance?

We were under the impression that we were just paying the cash price only and that it wouldn't be submitted to insurance in the first place. Why would it need to be if I'm just paying the cash price?"

HealthInsurance,"I don't know that any of us who work in the industry will be able to convince you otherwise - but your personal, anecdotal experiences represent a tiny fraction of the individual experience of some folks here, let alone the collective experience of them all.  You're saying one thing and at least 3 people with more than 50 years combined, practical working experience are saying that's not how things work.

HealthInsurance,"Depending on how you're doing your taxes and what system or way you're going it, they're going to ask you ""Did you have health insurance for 2017?"" because the taxes you file this year are for last year. Then it'll prompt you to enter the time frame for when you had it, and member ID number, I know some systems even ask for copies of it or other things, it just really depends on the system used and how you do it. 

Next year in 2019, you'll do taxes for 2018, so when they will still ask you if you had health insurance. 

Now for 2019 taxes that will be filed in 2020, it's said that Trump did away with the idea of having to get an ACA compliant plan which will do away with the fines.... but he also changes his mind about things every single day. So there's that."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Are they still eligible for Medicare in the US having paid into the system for over 20 years and were at one point considered a permanent resident?

Earning a quarter basically requiree earning a minimum amount in any given quarter/year - if memory serves, currently something around $1,300 a quarter.

HealthInsurance,"Unfortunately, it’s a shady move that puts you in a crappy situation. They assumed based off of the initial estimate what the medical insurance would cover, and they shouldn’t have because medical insurance RARELY covers anesthesia for wisdom teeth removal. Since they appealed and the insurance company upheld the denial, there isn’t much left to do. You COULD call the insurance company yourself, but it likely won’t change anything. The provider would have been your biggest bet with negotiation but since they are unwilling to budge, there isn’t much else you can do. And if you don’t pay, they will send it to collections."
HealthInsurance,"It's going to depend on several things. First, how much information are you trying to get shared?  The government established a standard for sharing records between providers, but the *minimum* government requirement is very bare: your allergies, prescriptions, and chronic diseases (further, the government can only penalize providers for not sharing if they see Medicare patients, so a lot of providers just don't bother).  That said, the government's standard *can* do much more, but it's up to the providers and their software to actually do more than the bare minimum.

I predict faxing records between doctors to remain a thing for the next few decades, at least.  You should ask your current doctor to send your records to your new one, they should give you a consent form to fill out, and will probably send whatever they can through whatever route their software permits."
HealthInsurance,"If you discussed medical conditions/received treatment, or a new prescription during your annual physical then there may be a separate office visit charge, for services provided outside of the wellness visit. (For example, if I go in for my annual physical but also mention I'm having headaches and neck pain and the doctor refers me to physical therapy for the neck pain, and a new prescription to help with the headaches, this is outside of what the free wellness visit covers)

You shouldn't be charged for the paperwork filing or anything like that. Do you have the CPT from your bill, that is causing your balance? 

Edit: a depression screening should be included with the wellness visit. It's typically a questionnaire or questions asked by the doctor. "
HealthInsurance,"yep, you'll want to get that started early on because it can be a bit of a fiddle to complete all the enrollment info.

HealthInsurance,"Ok, so why does it say Medicare of Pennsylvania on the insurance?"
HealthInsurance,"No specific advice, but if, as you say, ""[m]ost of my coworkers are outside New England,"", it feels strongly like either your employer's group insurance broker/agent or the insurer - probably both - have grossly disserved you, your fellow employees, and your employer implementing a plan that doesn't take account of the fact that most employees are not in the insurer's service area.

Have you spoken with whomever acts as your employer's HR person? It's very likely they have little or no expertise in benefits, nor any say in vendor selection even if they do, but it's a box you want to check in getting resolution. 

What about your fellow employees who are not living in the state where your employer is?  Have you asked them what if any their arrangements are?

You may find more effective routes to satisfaction of your situation, but I might suggest you contact the commissioner of the insurance department in the state where youre employer is headquartered, and maybe even your own, as well as your state-level elected officials, relating your circumstances.

HealthInsurance,"Contact HR and make sure that your insurance did in fact terminate on your final day.  Often times, it doesn't.

"
HealthInsurance,"This isn't really true for out of network charges if the hospital is out of network.

Out of network can bill as much as they like and the out of network coverage the insurance company will pay is its percentage of a ""reasonable and customary"" amount known only to the insurance company.

So, you could be billed $100,000 out of network and the insurance company considers $50,000 reasonable and customary.  You pay your out of network maximum of, say, $11,000 and the insurance company pays $39,000, bringing the total payments up to $50,000.  Insurance company is done!  But YOU ARE NOT.  There are still $50,000 remaining to be paid.  BY YOU.   This is called balance billing.  Some states have protection against it in SOME instances, but mostly in cases like emergency room treatment and non-surgeon providers when the hosptial is in-network but some ancillary providers are not. 

Avoid this if you possibly can, it is a very risky game.

HealthInsurance,Cigna.
HealthInsurance,"What's your expected income through the end of 2018? You may not be accurately figuring your eligibility for premium subsidies.

You need health insurance. You don't buy it because ""you need to use the vast majority of services"". You buy it because you MIGHT need to use expensive services you can't afford. Typical bills generated by one day's hospital stay: $4,000+. You can't afford that. Get insurance. Don't be stupid.

HealthInsurance,Did you change the dose or quantity prescribed? It's possible they got reclassified in another tier. Is it brand name? Did a generic just come out? Are you certain they ran it through your insurance?
HealthInsurance,"I’ve had to go to a 24/7 minor emergency for stitches and I wrote on the paper work “I agree to pay no more than $250 for my visit.” I paid the $250 and they tried billing me after the fact. I told them to show me the paper work that I signed and point out where I agreed to their charges. They stopped calling after that and it never got sent to collections. After looking at yelp reviews for the same place, Neighbors health clinic, someone posted they took in their son for heat stroke. Neighbors, gave him a Gatorade and wet towel then charged this yelp reviewer $1200. "
HealthInsurance,"There’s definitely a chance you will be diagnosed with something. It’s generally necessary for billing purposes. They need a code to justify the service and expenditure. "
HealthInsurance,"From what I understand of the tax law, yes, you’re still on the hook for that penalty. :/"
HealthInsurance,"Important note - (in many cases) upon delivery, the new baby is a separate, new patient.  Unless your parent's coverage includes grandchildren there is no coverage for the baby's charges in the hospital.  Though this can vary by state.

You may have to enroll the child in their own coverage through the local medicaid program or seek other coverage."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; the overwhelming majority of employer-based plans these days are self-funded.

probably more accurately, the majority of *people* covered by employer-sponsored health benefits are in self-funded plans. Most employ**ers** are small - under 100 employees - and not well-suited for self-funding. At the same time, they don't account for the greatest # of employ**ees**."
HealthInsurance,"What you've actually paid for =/= what you're billed for, in terms of what is calculated in the deductible. Insurance company could care less if you actually pay your doctor. So whatever you've had billed from actual submitted claims is what is added to the deductible. 

So where have the $1995.60 come from? Have those claims been filed through your insurance? If so, then that's already into your deductible, regardless of if you've actually paid it. 

The missing piece of information here would be if the deductible has an individual and family value. As in, are there individual deductibles embedded in an overall family deductible. Sounds possible since it seems like there's a family out of pocket max. 

Does the plan specify if the $2,700 is an individual deductible or family? If it's individual, what are the family values? 

Also, is the deductible the same as the out of pocket maximum? Usually there's a separate value for the out of pocket maximum. "
HealthInsurance,"Yep. Some auto insurers won’t pay primary if your health insurance will pay primary, but if you aren’t insured at all then auto insurance should pick it up. Unless you only had PLPD coverage. Also depends on the state in terms of at fault stuff. That might be a matter for another subreddit. "
HealthInsurance,How do you buy your drugs with no job. Waste of life.
HealthInsurance,"CDHP would be my recommendation.
You save $544 in premium contribution compared to the ""PPO"". Employer gives you $600 in non-taxable HSA contribution. Total of lower premium + HSA contribution = $1,144. 
Deductible difference is $750 in favor of PPO. But, you go on to say you're young and healthy. So, it's likely, barring significant treatments for an accident or illness, that you won't reach even the PPO deductible. In which case, you would have given up $1,144 in pre-tax monies if you went with the PPO.
I suggest choosing the CDHP and depositing the $21 per pay period difference in premium contribution into your HSA - giving you another $546 in your HSA by year end (assuming 26 pay periods).
Good luck and let me know next year how you made out!!"
HealthInsurance,"Unless you are looking at the ""UHC Compass Catastrophic ST INN"" plan?  With a $7,350 deductible?  That one has 100% RX coverage after the deductible but specialty drugs are not covered."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; do you have any idea on what I can do to get him good insurance plan with his condition and the possible costs?

Parents' move will trigger a special enrollment event so both would be able to enroll in new ACA coverage where you are. 


But there are issues. I'm assuming your parents will have no/low forseeable income. That could be a problem, because Texas has not expanded Medicaid coverage, so people whose income is UNDER 100% FPL don't qualify for premium tax credits for any coverage they buy. Coverage for people 60+ is about as expensive as it gets for non-Medicare eligibles anywhere in the US, &amp; Texas is among the worst for both lack of choice and cost of coverage.

Good for you doing what you can to help your folks out but your idea of moving dad may need to be looked at more closely"
HealthInsurance,"Hey there, pre-existing conditions can't prevent you from getting coverage on the Marketplace, and all Marketplace plans will cover mental health issues. 

Here's a primer on the metal tiers: https://www.healthsherpa.com/blog/why-do-metal-levels-matter-when-shopping-for-a-marketplace-plan/ 

Depending on how much you make, you could qualify for a subsidy. In some cases, that makes the Bronze and even Silver plans more affordable than lower tiered plans. 

Given your list of medical issues, I would definitely avoid the Catastrophic plan (what I have). I'm fairly healthy with some chronic back issues and honestly this Catastrophic plan has me tiptoeing around life. But Bronze was wayyy too expensive for me:( 

Good luck!"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the advice.  When we log into the account online, the only SBC we can get is the 2017."
HealthInsurance,That's strange. After I reported my income changes they told me that I no longer qualified and they would close my account. It took about 3 weeks to close. And I had an overlap for a month
HealthInsurance,"Did you have previous coverage? If so, when did it end?"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Right, but it would eventually get sorted out and save me $30,000. I’m seeing a surgeon tomorrow. The surgeons I saw in Ecuador both recommended non operational treatment. If the American surgeon disagrees, time is of the essence. "

HealthInsurance,"&gt;is there a way to apply late? 

Only if you qualify for a special enrollment period.

Your december problem is odd. If you were working fulltime it looks like you would have made enough to qualify for premium tax credits, which would have lowered your monthly premiums substantiallyl.

However - because Texas didn't expand Medicaid coverage - if you weren't working fulltime, &amp; expected to have under $12k annual income, you WOULDN'T qualify for either Medicaid OR ACA tax credits.

I take it new job doesn't offer any health coverage either.

Texas sucks as a place to obtain individual health insurance coverage."
HealthInsurance,"If you're already enrolled in that plan it's probably your best option.  You won't qualify for a subsidy because of your income and the fact that your employer offers coverage.  The other issue is that you'll only be able to enroll in an individual plan if you have a qualifying event - Like having a baby, moving, losing coverage from ypur job, etc.  What are your concerns about the plan offered by your employer?"
HealthInsurance,Are you covered under your parents insurance until you are out of school? I thought that was the case
HealthInsurance,You'll be fine - You'll have to pay a little more - But you'll still have coverage.  Do you have any chronic medical conditions?  What county are you in?
HealthInsurance,"Ive already said the first part of your statement, more or less. The description of HDHP IS perspective given that no government regulation defines ""high deductible"", only minimum deductible for HSA qualifying plans.

We've gotten off track here. My original intention was for OP to make sure his new benefit has an Rx benefit separate from the medical deductible, a la NOT an HSA qualifying HDHP plan OR any other integrated medical/pharmacy deductible benefit since Humira will run a few thousand/month until either the deductible or the OOPM is met. The good scenario would be a medical benefit with a copay-first pharmacy plan and an equitable cost share to current. These obviously exist whether the medical deductible is $0 or $5,000."
HealthInsurance,"Nothing to really worry about. When you call your billing department, give them your insurance info and ask them to submit the claim. Should be that easy... "
HealthInsurance,"Firstly, I would like to correct myself. He is on MEDICARE. I apologize for the confusion. In my frustration I mixed the two up.
To answer your questions:
1. Pennsylvania 
2. I’m not sure if this is still relevant because he’s not on Medicaid.
3. Yes, they accept both Medicare and Medicaid. 
4. I was emailed the bill this afternoon directly from the hospital."
HealthInsurance,"Dental insurance is suggested but not required.

And you can choose not to apply all your estimated subsidy.  You'll get more of your subsidy back @ the end of the year.  "
HealthInsurance,"Also, just so you know, online gambling might be illegal, but you are still required to report it to the Internal Revenue Service. They can't use your tax returns against you, but if they find out you're making money and not reporting it, you're in for a world of hurt. That's how they got Al Capone."
HealthInsurance,"Self-funded is neither bad nor good on its own, and it’s not anything new. I’d hazard the overwhelming majority of employer-based plans these days are self-funded. At the barest, all self-funded means is that the employer group is collecting and storing premiums and then paying claims themselves with that money. The employer gets to keep the difference if it takes in more in premiums than it spends on claims, but the employer (outside of stop-loss hybrids) also has to cover the cost if claim payments exceed premiums. Since the employer takes on this additional risk and responsibility, they get a lot more control over the kind of plans they offer.

Self-funding does allow employers to opt out of _state_ mandates, and most employers do (yay capitalism), but they cannot opt out of federal (ACA) mandates. Federal rules supersede the funding type of the plan. That being said, every plan is going to be different, so that the plan is self-funded doesn’t really say much about it. There plenty of decent self-funded plans and there are plenty of amazing self-funded plans. All self-funded means is the employer group is given more flexibility"
HealthInsurance,End of Nov :(
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Is there an innovative health insurance product for low-income earners that's maybe specific for your region or country?

Short answer is no

Longer explanation for why not involves understanding why [this chart is the most important chart in all of US health care](http://healthcare311.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/healthcare_power_law1.jpg). I'm too lazy to do that in detail here; basically, all the big brains whose agenda involves ""revolutionizing"" health care studiously ignore the truths embodied in it, and it has to do as much with the small-p politics of moving health policy as it does with the present distribution of care costs.

One current development that MAY substantively alter the cost-distribution arc: changing institutional habits around the reimbursement of remote care - telehealth/telemedicine, specifically. That has the potential to starkly shift spending on labor &amp; facility-intensive chronic &amp; maintenance care. But that change will take place over  years, not months."
HealthInsurance,"thanks very much.  this sounds realistic.  this is what i needed to hear.  the details and jargon really make your point.

there is no licensing of any kind applicable to what i make.  they're art pieces, wearable personal art. 


"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks. Is there anything I should do? Or should I just wait for more EOBs and see if I get a bill? 

"
HealthInsurance,"Marketplace would be an option, but if you don't qualify for a subsidy it will probably be very expensive. 

I might have some suggestions outside of the marketplace, but it would depend on what state you are in."
HealthInsurance,It's typical you picking up the tap for mistake made by someone else. I had that happened to me on a mandatory annual physical. Hospital basically billed my insurance as regular visit instead of preventative benefit. Yeah you will need to waste tons of time and effort to get it corrected and be prepare to get sholve back and forth by your insurer and care provider.
HealthInsurance,"So there's a difference between how your insurance will process it and how the provider will bill you. By law (maybe state, so look into this and/or check your benefit summary) emergency services must fall under your in network benefits regardless of the status of the provider. This means what you'll pay, the to extent of being the difference of your insurance will allow to the provider and between what they pay and what you owe of that allowed amount, will go to your in network deductible. However, being an out of network provider, they can generally do whatever they want in billing you and your best bet is to go directly to them to negotiate a lower responsibility.

To your question of how to determine their contract status, yes this is very difficult. ER docs are  now part of a group of physician categories called RAPLE - radiology, anesthesiology , pathology, laboratory, emergency. These physician services are typically not very visible to the average consumer therefore they're contracted status is also not very evident. What then happens is the member is stuck with a bill from a non-contracted provider. Additionally because these providers are often the only one of their kind at any given facility, whether in network hospitals or out of network, they can call their own shots on whether they contract with an insurance provider. In my professional experience, hospitals never leverage these provider groups to contract.

As a follow-up, many states have produced legislation that prohibits out of network providers from billing individuals in these kind of circumstances. I would do research into that for your state."
HealthInsurance,"You have two routes and I suggest following both of them. https://www.medicare.gov/claims-and-appeals/file-a-complaint/health-or-drug-plan/complaints-about-plans.html is to file a complaint with Medicare, and your mother's state's Insurance Agency has some way of filing a complaint with them."

HealthInsurance,"Oh no it must be a grandfathered plan! Those are the only ones that can deny pregnancy as a covered benefit. 

I just wanted to correct something else that was posted -- pregnancy does not make you eligible for enrollment outside of Open Enrollment. It's the birth of a child that does. https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/ 

I would first get a current SBC/SoB from your insurer and double check no one else has screwed up in telling you what coverage you have. If you truly aren't covered for the pregnancy, I think your best bet may be to get additional short-term coverage until she's 26 and can enroll in a Marketplace plan. 

Sorry that our health insurance system is screwing you out of so much money (I'm on a catastrophic plan and terrified of getting injured or otherwise needing medical care), but congrats to you and your wife! "
HealthInsurance,Thanks I did.
HealthInsurance,"I think they were probably asking you for an ""eligibility assessment"" and income verification for Medicaid eligibility.  You can try calling them (try early mornings) and say everything that you did here - you originally applied in Nov, etc.  I'd try Medicaid first: 1-866-550-4355  "
HealthInsurance,"No

Edit: Yes"
HealthInsurance,"One of my favorite stories is a Tao (though often told is Buddhist lessons) story called The Farmer and the Horse. The idea is is that a farmer's horse runs away and his neighbor comes by to say ""Oh, I'm so sorry about your horse."" The neighbor smiles and says ""Yes my horse ran away, but is it truly a good thing or a bad thing?"" The neighbor leaves confused. The next day the horse returns with three young bucks following it. The neighbor hears the news and comes by ""Oh congrats on the new horses."" The farmer replies ""Yes it is true that I have three new horses, but is it truly a good thing or bad thing."" The next day the farmer's son is breaking in the new horses and gets thrown breaking his leg. The neighbor comes by, ""Oh I'm so sorry..."" The farmer ""Is it a good thing or a bad thing."" The next day a general comes conscripting men for the army and pass over the son because of his broken leg....and it continues on from there. The ultimate moral is that it is perspective and that no matter what every situation, whether providing benefit or hardship, is temporary and it matters more what we do in response.

This story has been on my mind all day and this situation is the  motivation I need to leave my comfortable but dead end job for something with better growth and provides more of a challenge (though I might keep the easy job for 10 hours a week because their vacation policies and flexibility will be amazing if a full time position opens up)..

Anyway, thank you but I think, now that I have had time to process it, that as unfortunate as it is I will be better off in the end. :)"
HealthInsurance,"I lost mine at the end of the month I turned 26.  Get the Certificate of Prior Coverage--you will need it.  Calling your insurance company is the only way to figure this out for sure.

Try to line up the paperwork with your job so you have coverage the day after your coverage ends.  Doing as much of this as soon as possible is the best way to minimize any gap.  With the retroactive date see if the providers are willing to have you sign self pay with a small down payment or no down payment or a payment plan.  As long as the retroactive payments go through it's not a big deal.  Many providers are willing to work with patients."
HealthInsurance,How much of each year do you typically spend in each state?  What's your income?
HealthInsurance,Just copy/paste what I put into quotation marks for you.
HealthInsurance,Thank you for informing me. People like you make the world a better place.
HealthInsurance,"Im a lawyer and doing as much research as I can.  Apparently this shit is not new. Finding lots of articles on them. Allegations that they are scamming patients, not explaining expected costs, inducing them to receive services under the impression they are the normal type of ""urgent care"" clinic, etc.  Pretty good [article](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/2017/01/10/lewisville-based-adeptus-faces-class-action-suit-excessive-fees-free-standing-emergency-rooms) ""Freestanding urgent care and emergency centers still appear to be synonymous to the public, ""and it is this perception upon which Adeptus preys,"" the complaint said.

HealthInsurance,"Holy shit I've been so stressed and haven't slept, this is pretty relieving to hear. Thank you"
HealthInsurance,"This is insanely financially irresponsible behavior (I'm assuming you guys aren't millionaires with piles of cash laying around wondering what to spend it all on) as well as a sign of being a paranoid hypochondriac. I don't think I'd look at it as anything besides that. If she isn't a newborn or elderly, then there is no reason she should have gone to the ER for the flu even if she had it. I'd try to suggest some financial responsibility education as well as possible therapy / medical education to work on her paranoia."
HealthInsurance,"argggh, that is horrible. Only one thing left to do; get your state gov't representatives involved, with a polite - but firm - appeal to your state's connector people. Somewhere on that site will be info on how to file an appeal/complaint/etc.

 CC whomever your state representative/senator/etc is -that gets the regulators' attention (elected reps are 'motivated' to solve problems for their constituents, even constituents who maybe did not vote for them). In fact, if you don't FIND an appeal process on the CO marketplace website, contact your elected rep's office &amp; ask them to help you with it - it'll give you an idea how competent they are, because you won't be the FIRST person in their district who's needed help with health coverage issues.

Good luck,"
HealthInsurance,"Hiya,

Regarding whether or not there is a red mark against a person going for citizenship if they need public assistance, this is the wrong place to ask.

However, I assume that she has an SSN? (or ITIN?).  If so, she can apply through the ny state of health website. The state has a phone number, 855-355-5777 for information.  They offer services in just about every language known to man.  "
HealthInsurance,"Hmmm.... Charlotte's not so hot for coverage options. 

I made you 35, &amp; earning 35k/yr. you'd qualify for pretty good premium credits. Coverage would cost you between $100 - $325/month, from lean coverage to pretty generous. Make much over $48k &amp; you run out of premium credits.


are the options you provided a screencap of from yourr employer, or where? They don't look like marketplace choices.

Oh, and you didn't tell us how much your contributions are for any of those options"
HealthInsurance,"The penalty is still valid for 2018, so...

HealthInsurance,"I would see if you guys qualify for subsidies on the Marketplace given that your wife doesn't work at the moment either. I would think you guys would qualify for the premium tax credit (https://www.healthsherpa.com/blog/what-to-know-premium-tax-credit/) and maybe even the cost-sharing reductions, the latter of which can actually make Silver plans cheaper than Bronze plans. "
HealthInsurance,"Unfortunately I'm not familiar with NY's rules, sorry. Calling them may be the best bet just to get yourself peace of mind so you know whether you can get back on. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes, if he gets a marketplace plan within the 60-day deadline after moving to a new state (a ""qualifying life event"") they will be required to cover the pre-existing condition.

April 6 seems like a long way away to be dealing with a torn ACL though. Even if you may have to repay deductibles (they will start over on the new plan) he should find someone to at least assess the damage now and advise you on the risks of waiting a month to begin treatment."
HealthInsurance,"people are giving you advice. They're not telling you why. to do, they're telling you what the doctors don't want to perform the procedure.

You need to calm down, and not be rude."
HealthInsurance,"Find a dental school in your area, see if they take patients. You'd have a student practitioner working on you under the direction of a licensed professional.  "
HealthInsurance,Thanks!
HealthInsurance,"It's generally by date of service on the bill, as far as I'm aware. If the service date is in 2017, you probably shouldn't use the HSA. 

Now that said... more likely its not the IRS that would do an audit, but the administration of the HSA provider. So if you want to roll the dice on whether you'd randomly get audited, there's certainly nothing otherwise stopping you from using a card associated with the account to pay the bill (assuming the card allows the transaction to go through, sometimes they'll auto-decline at say like, mcdonalds). "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the help. I went to the website and it had me call a number, saying I may be eligible for no cost insurance, but they said they wouldn't be able to give me any info regarding whether I'd be eligible or not until basically I'm off my parents plan."
HealthInsurance,"Your current state of coverage doesn't make a difference. The date of service was 12/29/17, so if you were covered then, you'll be billed in accordance to the terms of the plan you were on then. 

Are you sure you didn't just receive an EOB or something? The cost changing is very odd. Something else is going on. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; they wouldn't be able to give me any info regarding whether I'd be eligible or not until basically I'm off my parents plan.


hmmm. That doesn't sound quite right. They can tell you based on the facts of your situation whether you'd be eligible for coverage; they can't *enroll* you yet, certainly."
HealthInsurance,I looked through your comment history - If you moved to New Jersey recently you should have them apply for Medicaid - Green Card holders should be eligible for the program.
HealthInsurance,"There would definitely be differences between the two policies but it’s hard to say without anymore information how much difference and which one would be better. If your employer offers insurance you won’t be eligible for subsidies so keep that in mind. 

As far as the changes I’m not sure I know what you’re referring to. "
HealthInsurance,"Be careful. Self-funded plans can be cheaper but you might lose a lot. Look at your state laws first,  are there any mandates for required coverage a insurance company must provide that would apply to you?  Because you will lose that when you go to a self-funded plan. Self-funded plans are not applicable to your state laws, the laws regulating them are actually the federal ERISA from around 1974. The law is hopelessly out of date, this is good for your company as they won't have to cover as much but bad for you as a consumer. In a self-funded plan your employer is paying the bills and the rules regulating self-funded plans are all in their favor. The appeals process if they deny a claim is ridiculous. At this point you're going to have to deal with the US Department of Labor and good luck with that get ready for several months like 6 months or more of waiting. If you have some time the following link is a good read https://www.carcinoid.org/for-patients/general-information/what-if-insurance-wont-pay/excerpt-8-self-funded-plans-a-battle-on-two-fronts/

TLDR; the only one benefiting from a self-funded insurance plan is the employer you're getting screwed."
HealthInsurance,What company was this?
HealthInsurance,You need to list your pre-existing conditions - The insurance the administrator for the Department of State could easily find out that you lied  - While they don't explicitluly state what the repercussions are it's very possible they may cancel the entire policy.
HealthInsurance,"Can’t pay a penalty if you don’t have a return, which is just one of the many reasons I always aim to break even by not claiming 0 on my withholding. "
HealthInsurance,"Good point about staying with this employer--it's very hard to predict that, after only a few weeks.  We did 350, but if he's still with them next year, maybe we'll go higher.

We just couldn't justify not using it, given that it's pre-tax, and he'll certainly be using it eventually."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I'm hoping since I am working directly with the insurance company, not the marketplace - there may be a chance.

There would be a better chance if you were working with the marketplace than directly with the insurance company. You don't have the negotiating power of the marketplace behind you.  

&gt;Are you aware of any alternatives for insurance outside of the options which have a defined enrollment period? 

Short term plans would be your only option.  They won't cover pre-existing conditions and have wait periods on certain benefits.  Networks can be sketchy as well.  
"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"What is your out of pocket maximum? And what is the coverage after you hit your deductible?

No matter what, you'll be responsible for 100% of the costs until you hit your deductible.  After that it will depend on what % your plan will cover up to the OOP max, after which the insurance plan will cover 100% of the costs.  Basically:

$0-&gt; Deductible: You pay 100%  
Deductible -&gt; OOP Max: You pay percentage (often 20-30%)  
OOP Max -&gt; infinity (theoretically): Insurance pays 100%  "
HealthInsurance,"Awesome, thanks for all the information!  It's great to have people with the hands-on experience/knowledge to help sort through all the red tape!"
HealthInsurance,"Authorization to disclose health information and power of attorney both expire upon death. So the only way that BCBS representatives can share information with you is if there is executor of estate on file. 

Claims that initially rejected can take a long time to reprocess. In the mean time, your best bet is to get the executor of estate on file. Then call BCBS and ask them to conference the provider and ask to put the bill on hold while the claim is being adjusted. 

Don't pay the claim, it's not your responsibility. The provider might get salty, but that's just too bad. It's not your fault that it didn't process properly.

And yeah, file a grievance with CMS any time you're unhappy with BCBS Medicare products. They need to know what's working and not working, so that they know where improvement is needed."
HealthInsurance,"Yes but it's my experience that the individual plans are crap.  Smaller network, higher deductibles and coinsurance - this is in VA."
HealthInsurance,"Ah, good point on the billing timeframe. This is very reassuring -- thank you :)"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for letting me know that I only had until the end of February to enroll. Ended up applying and enrolling into a Gold Metal plan through the government site last night. It's honestly pretty crazy how expensive insurance is, especially for a self-employed individual. "
HealthInsurance,"I doubt it, presuming they prescribed a typical dose the first time. It sounds like you maybe didn't respond to a normal course of antibiotics (which is hard to establish after less than 48 hrs, btw) and sought additional care, in which case yes you'd be responsible for the charges. You can try to negotiate with the hospital, however. "
HealthInsurance,"I agree. I’m a new union employee, and this waiting period is my probationary period as listed in the union agreement (where they can fire me at will, I’m not able to do certain tasks, etc...). I guess part of this probationary period is the company does not help with my health insurance during this time. Apparently if I want to I can go through one of their plans still for this six months its just quite expensive. My coworkers have been here a while and said that in the past you just don’t get health insurance for six months, where as now the option is there just at higher cost. I’m getting the run around on this when I go to my boss. "
HealthInsurance,"You used to have to prove you were a full time student to remain on after a certain age.  It was a pain in the butt to verify every year and now you can just stay on until 26. Also - just because you're on your parent's plan don't think that it doesn't cost anything.  It costs your parents every month.  A lot of people don't understand that until they go get their own insurance.  "
HealthInsurance,"I'm repeating what my wife told me over the phone so I'm going to call when I get off work and get more details.

HealthInsurance,"oh, good 

so now what you want to do is guesstimate your total cost of coverage for each option. [That little arithimetic exercise can look something like this](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif). You can make it more or less complicated to suit your needs.

That won't reveal THE plan that fits you - you may also want to check whether plans require you to work with specific networks of clinicians &amp; facilities, and if so, whether the doctors and labs and pharmacies YOU like to use are part of plan networks."
HealthInsurance,"Healthcare.gov doesn't require medical assessments for enrollment.  You either enroll when you are eligible (within 60 days of losing coverage or during Open Enrollment for a 1/1 start date) or you don't get coverage until the next OE.

When did you insurance with your mother end and what date did you apply on Healthcare.gov?  Also, are you sure you applied on Healthcare.gov and not Healthcare.COM?"

I thought there was something to the effect that this should be based on your monthly income, so as long as you report changes immediately, there isn't a repayment penalty... but IANAL."
HealthInsurance,"Well, you are being taken advantage of by the healthcare industry, but there’s nothing you can do about it besides tell the hospital you can’t afford the bill and see if they can reduce it. They will usually only do that if you pay in full. 

This is why people are dying of the flu so much this year! It’s so damn expensive. Some ERs are plagued with folks who treat it like the doctor’s office because they know they’ll be seen without an appointment or insurance and they can ignore the bill. I was in the ER one time for severe pain and was there all day for all sorts of tests. A woman across the hall was there for a pregnancy test. Which you can get at the dollar store. The doctor treating her was peeved. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I suppose it wouldn’t necessarily be correct to say all HSA eligible plans are HDHPs, since that depends on your perspective of “high deductible”.

To be eligible to stash dough in an HSA, a person **must** be enrolled in a qualifying High Deductible Health Plan. Not any old plan with a high deductible. In fact, a HDHP may have a *lower* deductible than a NON-qualifying plan.  It's not a mater of perspective at all."
HealthInsurance,"You stay on it until you’re 26! My wife and I married at 23. She got pregnant at 24 and we got her an insurance plan while I stayed on my parents. The plan we bought is the primary insurance and her parents is her secondary. Everything was paid for up until the baby was born. If your parents have good insurance, I highly recommend getting a couple kids in before 26! We paid about $2000 all in for appointments, labor, and delivery. $500 of that was for an epidural."

HealthInsurance,"I believe you are required to cancel if you move out of state, which I will be doing. I should have cancelled earlier, but I'm afraid I do not have time anymore because I have to go to the county office to cancel (can't do it over the phone), while having to sell my car and departing to Japan in a matter of days. I am wondering if there are any penalties for not cancelling the plan."
HealthInsurance,"To ""accept insurance"" is meaningless.  I can ""accept insurance"" out of my garage.

At the most, it implies that you're willing to submit a claim for the patient.  

Each and every insurance company will have its own, wholly separate, vetting process.  You will likely need to be licensed/certified in your state to be a health care provider - either as a provider of durable medical equipment or a licensed orthotist, or both.  And that's at a minimum.

Then, in order to submit claims as a health care provider, you're required to follow the insurers process for submitting claims properly.  Most (likely all) will not accept paper claims mailed in from providers.  You would probably have to sumbit electronically, using their proprietary software or claims submission vehicle.  And again, each insurance company has its own method/process/software, etc.

If you want to give it a shot - I'm reasonably certain it will not cost you anything except your time.  You could try going to an insurer's website and selecting a ""for providers"" or some such option.  Either that or just calling them up to ask.

I would expect a lengthy, cumbersome process."

They covered some of it, said I was responsible for some of it.

What is weird is their is another spot where it shows a counter to out of pocket max for the year, and that has incremented the amount that they say is my responsibility, but the number for deductibles hasn't changed.
"
HealthInsurance,"So a DEVA is done by the employer to identify any dependents on the plan who are not actually dependents.  Typically it's to pull out those folks who are not actually married, or dependents who are aged off (but not caught for whatever reason by the carrier's database).  Usually insurance companies don't ask for marriage certificates so it's really easy to add someone to the policy and have them slip through the cracks.

Occasionally we run across an employer who doesn't cover spouses if they are eligible for coverage through their own employer.  The question to ask your HR department is ""Does ABC Company cover spouses who have the ability to get coverage through their own employer?"" If the answer is no, ask how much it would be for you to pay her premiums to keep her on ABC Company's plan.  

Most likely your employer pays part of the dependent premiums and they just want to make sure everyone they are paying for are legitimately eligible for benefits."

HealthInsurance,"So there are a couple reasons why I’ve been planning on getting off my mom’s coverage, but maybe you have some info for that too! :)

1) My mom is retired and turning 65 next year and I was told that once she goes to Medicare I won’t be able to stay on her coverage anymore, regardless of my age.

2) It’s so expensive for her! I’m an only child and she’s single, but she has to pay for the family plan even if it’s just the two of us, which works out to be crazy expensive every month (and definitely too expensive for me).

As for the other tidbits, we’re both pretty healthy; usually just go for our annual check-ups and the occasional cold, no major health concerns. I’m a full-time college student so I’m not making too much money, and I’d say our monthly net income stays somewhere around $2,500. We’re both hourly employees, though, so that does fluctuate some. We’re also located in KY, if that helps! I have no idea how Medicaid works as far as couples/families or the income cutoff, so I’m really just looking for any advice at all! Thank you for your response! :)"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;is this a reasonable priced plan?

it's not the price, it's  the value - and only you, with knowlege of your health, can know that.

**We**, on the other hand, don't know anything of your healt h status, your age, your physical location, etc - all things that impact the price of your coverage - before we ever even GET to value

"
HealthInsurance,"That is terrible advice.  Simply awful.  If you don't verify the relationship, they have every right to kick her off the plan."
HealthInsurance,"Nope, higher out of pocket max. I'm telling you, this marketplace is driving me bananas. I'll try to run some of those numbers in terms of total yearly expenditure possibilities... "
HealthInsurance,"It's still possible that the procedure is covered based on your daughter's age. As long as the facility you are using is considered in network, then the anesthesia should be priced and processed at the in network rate. Make sure to call your insurance and verify what those particular benefits are and have them check their coverage policy in regards to dental anesthesia for a pediatric patient and if there are any restrictions on your particular policy. "
HealthInsurance,"I know of no group insurance carrier who offers a truly voluntary plan (100% employee paid) for a standard group (under 1000 lives). Most require a 50% contribution from the employer for at least employee coverage (not including dependents).  I say this because if your employer isn't paying towards the premiums most likely they are going against the contract.

In addition, ALL rates are based on experience.  In my state (Virginia) with a small group (under 50 lives) they put a bunch of small groups together and use the ""pooled"" experience to come up with the rates. Same with Individual.  As it stands, the individual pools are running much worse than small group pools in most states so the rates are higher for individuals and the plans are worse."

HealthInsurance,"&gt;How does one go about finding cheaper health insurance without getting 50 calls in a day? or using a web portal?



pretty much have to obtain your coverage via marketplace to obtain premium credits, which save you money.

Have you tried something like [HealthSherpa](https://www.healthsherpa.com)? It's pretty straightforward"
HealthInsurance,I'd look at your costs for the pregancy and delivery on each plan and factor in the premiums. It's been my experience that double coverage doesn't really do much in the grand scheme of things but it sounds like your plans are pretty restrictive. I'd make sure mom gets on the best plan for her pregnancy and delivery - check the networks for her docs. Good luck!
HealthInsurance,"&gt; in most states the individual plans are worse and more expensive than group plans.

This is sort of a *non sequitur*. from the vantage point of an individual, a lot depends on the individual's characteristics; their age, their family status, their gender, their health treatment needs, etc. It's not so much that your assertion can't be proved, it's that there's no objective way to make sense of your assertion"
HealthInsurance,"Awesome. God bless America.
"
HealthInsurance,"The reason there are so many is because poor people tend to use ERs as their primary health care.

HealthInsurance,Laziness is part of it. Being yelled at by docs who don't want to be corrected is another part.
HealthInsurance,"Both /u/amyhobbit and /u/Julepe0 have given excellent advice.  Start with your school's plan.  Because your income is likely to stick you in the ""unsweet"" spot that states that haven't expanded medicaid subject their citizens to (yes, I'm salty about this), your school's plan is likely your best bet."
HealthInsurance,"If it's a voluntary termination outside of the regular enrollment period, then no.  If your spouse cancels coverage during her enrollment, then you *should* be able to enroll in yours, although sometimes the paperwork is awful."
HealthInsurance,"Moving back to the U.S. qualifies you for a Special Enrollment Period, which would allow you to buy coverage now. More info here: https://www.healthsherpa.com/blog/what-is-considered-a-qualifying-life-event/ 

I'm not sure if it would make you uninsurable in the future, though your whole situation could have tax penalties depending on what your current tax status is. If you stay out of the U.S. for more than 330 days or are a ""bona fide"" resident of another country per IRS standards, then you should be okay on that end. Otherwise you may end up w/the tax penalty. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. Exactly what I am looking for. "
HealthInsurance,"Correct, once you set FSA contributions you cannot change them until next Open Enrollment.  If you want to contribute to the FSA, making your contributions equal to the deductible makes sense and since the highest deductible is at the level that can be rolled over ($500) you're good.  Re-evaluate your FSA contributions when he renews next year. You might find that you don't need to contribute anything for 2019 (if the plans don't change).

All of that being said, unless you know you're going to be out of pocket for a lot of co-payments (doc visits &amp; RX), I wouldn't contribute to the FSA at all for a plan with a deductible that low.  My opinion."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; (how are you gonna tell me that a plan has a higher premium AND a higher co-pay and deductible? what??) 

Could have a lower overall out of pocket max. 

All ACA compliant healthcare plans address mental health and the rest of your concerns. 

Dental coverage is traditionally handled separately from major medical. 

You should evaluate the plans for their total yearly expenditure (out of pocket max + premium). Then determine approximately how much you think the care you need will cost. Pick a plan that best suits your financial estimates. "
HealthInsurance,"Dumb question,

Can you buy health insurance or some kind of supplemental insurance that covers out of pocket fees like nurses and anesthesia?"
HealthInsurance,Flex spending plans are similar in that they allow you to put aside pre-tax money (when through your employer) to pay out of pocket healthcare costs.
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Are you sure about the math on the penalty?

Heavens no ;-D

on reflection, your understanding sounds more likely than mine"
HealthInsurance,"I'm not familiar with Nevada regulations, but try calling an [Exchange Navigator](https://www.nevadahealthlink.com/get-help/navigator-organizations/).  Despite the feds destroying Navigator program funding back in September, they're still around to help individuals find and enroll in affordable health insurance and Medicaid.  They'll be able to give you specific advice."
HealthInsurance,"Our EHR in Residency did that but this one doesn’t have that feature. "
HealthInsurance,How old are you and ypour wife?  What's your projected combined income?
HealthInsurance,"I would opt for the copay plan because of the frequent dr visits. With the first two plans, you’d be paying 100% out of pocket for the first $6500. Depending on the price difference, I’d do gold or platinum. "

HealthInsurance,"https://www.kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2017-section-1-cost-of-health-insurance/attachment/figure%201_10-28/

Here's a start - The Kaiser Foundation has a large amount of data on health insurance coverage"
HealthInsurance,"If the provider is in-network it is their responsibility to get the auth done. You shouldn’t be billed, they will have to work with the insurance company and write it off if they can’t get it covered."
HealthInsurance,"Most mid to large size employers have a self funded health plan because since they assume the risk, they can control costs easier than being at the insurance company’s mercy. I would recommend reading your summary of benefits and coverage as well as plan document because you may find that it’s cheaper/more coverage than what you can find on the exchange.

Besides a small group of “grandfathered” plans, self insured plans must comply with the ACA. "
HealthInsurance,Ok thank you very muxh
HealthInsurance,"Alright. Say my mother calls providence or moda to ask why they're not paying for my ER visit. You're saying that not only is it not related to whatever I drank or smoked, but that the insurance company would not reveal that information anyway?"
HealthInsurance,"Will it matter that my wife checked the box that says insurance was not available at her employer?  In years past, it's never been an issue, because they didn't offer insurance, but just started doing so this year. "
HealthInsurance,If you do get to keep it do NOT present it as your primary insurance. Your commercial policy is now your primary insurance and your medicaid policy will ALWAYS be secondary (assuming you remain covered under medicaid)
HealthInsurance,have you checked around to see if there are any private health coverage options that wouldn't care about any enrollment periods?
HealthInsurance,"In addition to what /r/realanceps said, let me just add that sometimes you can engineer a special enrollment period.  Ie, ""move"" from one county to the next.  Often times, this will allow you to enroll through a special enrollment period."
HealthInsurance," Only Medicaid will retroactively cover someone."
HealthInsurance,Thanks for your reply. I will probably be doing taxes this year on my own. What kind of proof should I have in order to do verify this?
HealthInsurance,"If you get married before you're 26, you fall of your parents insurance, because you're no long their dependent."
HealthInsurance,"The age was extended to 26 through the ACA, actually. It used to end much sooner. "
HealthInsurance,"see if there are any private coverage companies that are available near you. do your best to not go online and put your phone number down (endless telemarketers!!!) rotten luck though.. "
HealthInsurance,"I'm certainly glad I did my research BEFORE with the first provider or else I'd be kicking myself!

Now I'm completely paranoid. First big surgery so it's nice to hear that I'm doing the right thing, especially with the flack I've gotten from both the providers and the insurance company. Persistence pays off though! (For reals, this is like a second job though.)"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;When the support agent came back on the phone, they said that the employer plan has a clause that it will not cover maternity costs unless the pregnancy has “complications.” I cannot find any documentation to verify this, and I do not trust them to be adequate at their jobs considering the first support agent said that she had no coverage.

That's a fairly standard policy for employers.  They will cover the pregnancy of the employee, but not their kids. 

&gt; Is there anything we can do between now and June to get coverage?

Not really.  Just sign up for coverage immediately when her birthday rolls around.  Only other option would be if you qualify for Medicaid for expecting mothers.  Check your state program to see if you qualify.

&gt;Will all of this money count toward a deductible when she gets a new plan? 

No.  "
HealthInsurance,How did it go?
HealthInsurance,"What county do you live in?  What's your income?  Have you recently moved, changed jobs, lost coverage, gotten married, etc.?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;do I NEED to enroll in COBRA?

what do I win?

but seriously, here's a [walkthru of a COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) we kick around a lot in here - the subject comes up a lot. Applied carefully, it can give you a ""no cash flow hedge"" for a couple of months while you figure out your best move for ongoing health coverage."
HealthInsurance,"I know divorce is an eligible qualifying life event. I'm saying though that you have to have had insurance before the divorce for it to make you eligible. 

https://www.healthcare.gov/blog/coverage-loss-for-special-enrollment-period/  ""You may qualify if you... lose health coverage through a spouse due to a divorce, legal separation, or through the death of a family member.""

Just wanted to make sure OP knew there's a chance of being denied."
HealthInsurance,"the skew is pretty startling: three-HUNDREDTHS of a percent of all US employers employ over one-third of all private non-farm employEEs in the US. Meanwhile businesses with 4 or fewer employees comprise over 60% of employers, but  just over five percent of all employEEs. 

As with so many things about health insurance, an average is an almost meaningless measure"
HealthInsurance,How does this work?
HealthInsurance,He has a California license. It looks like that is all he needs to show residency. Thank you again.
HealthInsurance,"You make very valid points in that the majority of plans are high deductibles &amp; providers have a difficult time collecting the amount owed if billing after the services have been completed. As someone who works for health insurance I simply wanted to clarify that it isn't a matter of the insurance not caring about what may have been paid. The claims are simply processed according to the patient's plan benefits &amp; the member is provided with the total cost they are responsible for. This ensures that they are not overpaying for the services. 
When I am discussing these policies and the subject of billing with a member/patient I defend the providers and try to ensure there is an overall understanding. In a perfect world that would be done by everyone but I know it isn't the 'norm'. I am just extremely passionate and believe that if there wasn't incorrect or lack of information there would be a GREAT reduction in stress for everyone. Thank you for listening to my additional little rant ;)"
HealthInsurance,"It’s a pretty standard plan. High deductible but the coverage is pretty good and they have a portal that helps you save money on prescriptions if you choose to use it. "
HealthInsurance,"Typically no - You have to qualify for a special enrollment period by moving, having a baby, getting married, losing coverage, etc.  The only exception to this would be Medicaid.  What county do you live in?  What's your income?"
HealthInsurance,"Yes, that’s my thought. In the instance of other plans that would have a copay rather than deductible, the provider would have gotten money from insurance anyways, so it could also be that it’s just a general billing practice they do across the board? Honestly, I see so many things providers do that make zero sense to me. But on the flip side, same with insurance practices. "
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Hmmm, probably not. Missouri didn 't expand Medicaid either"
HealthInsurance,"heed Dane's words, specifically these:

&gt; DO NOT PAY THIS DEBT

&gt; DO NOT PAY

HealthInsurance,"It seems the deadline for applying was Jan 31, 2018. My income should qualify me for medicaid as it has years before, but I was still in school at that time. And both my parents are under medicaid as well.

/e. As for options, I can write to them, call, and/or email them within 60 days to request a fair hearing as to why I disagree with their decision to end my coverage. I'm hoping when I call them later that they'll allow me to walk in with the paperwork and proof and allow me to renew on the spot. "
HealthInsurance,"I think OP would have to show previous medical coverage was lost due to divorce in order to qualify for the Divorce-triggered Special Enrollment Period. "
HealthInsurance,The experience for a fully insured group of 25 is pooled. This means (depending on your state) that your new employer won't see the claims. Even if they were partially self-funded and had access to claims they wouldn't know who was taking the expensive drug.  As far as rate impact goes - if it's a small fully insured group - in most states the rates are published &amp; experience is pooled - this means a group's experience doesn't impact the rates in any way. A super healthy group of 25 pays the same as a super sick group of 25.
HealthInsurance,"If you aren’t working then you should look into your state’s medicaid program. Google that and see how to apply. "
HealthInsurance,"Welcome - a few of us regulars have composed some 'toolkit'-type things that we trot out to illustrate things (a picture's worth 1,000 words, etc). We don't get a whole lot of feedback, so your ""review"" is valuable."
HealthInsurance,"October 29th. Last year. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, guess I will try again. I have been rejected though so i need to request to do an appeal. "
HealthInsurance,Yeah.  I'm not sure she's actually reading through our responses.

HealthInsurance,"Regarding medications, you can always call the pharmacy to talk to the pharmacist and ask them typically for this drug plan what steroid is covered, you can ask them to run a test claim for you, you can ask them to look for the formulary for you. Just ask nicely. "
HealthInsurance,You’re eligible under your parents’ plan(s) until you’re 26 and you may also be eligible if your college offers a plan (many do now).
HealthInsurance,I applied a couple of months ago - mid January I think... I don't lose coverage until 90 days from now.  I have to try to find a plan through Covered California.
HealthInsurance,"I live in Sedgwick county. I’m seeing a surgeon tomorrow. The surgeons I saw in Ecuador both recommended non operational treatment. If the American surgeon disagrees, time is of the essence. "
HealthInsurance,"Hmm..., now that I look I do see that a Cigna plan was in place, but has since been canceled.

It's kind of confusing, because I filled out an application, and there was a special enrollment period through mid Feb., which I missed.  So that begs the question - why would I need to choose a plan to avoid cancellation if one was automatically put in place? 

Do I have a case for an appeal?"
HealthInsurance,"Yes they are both generic, and I know that they ran it through my insurance because the out of pocket price for the one is $42, the other is about $400.  I looked up the tables with the tier classifications, and of the amounts listed, there isn't a match to what I was charged.  Incredibly confusing and frustrating.  No dosage or quantity change either."
HealthInsurance,"Agreed, hang tight.  If you get a bill from the hospital that reflects the EOB, call the hospital to see if it's a coding error.  After that, if needed, call the insurance company."
HealthInsurance,"If you started paying for him through your insurance, he no longer has health first"
HealthInsurance,"For National Coverage Determinations for Lab billing specifically, Medicare has helpfully compiled a number of them into [this 2000+ page PDF](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/CoverageGenInfo/Downloads/manual201801_ICD10.pdf) (which is 99.9% lists of ICD-10 codes)."
HealthInsurance,"No, we drove him. The hospital is literally five minutes away. Would it be better if I’d called 911?"
HealthInsurance,Virginia.
HealthInsurance,"I pay $650 per month just for me. "
HealthInsurance,"Your employer either allows spouses with other coverage available to enroll or not - if they ask why she checked ""no other coverage available"" explain that they just started offering it. The real question is if they allow spouses to enroll on your plan when they have the ability to enroll elsewhere. Most employers do but there are a few that don't."
HealthInsurance,I'm probably more cautious than most with my private info.  I've had everything stolen down to my fingerprints so I'd definitely question handing over the level of info they are requesting. Just my 2 cents.  I don't see anything wrong with asking more questions.
HealthInsurance,Thanks a lot man. I'll look into that and see
HealthInsurance,"Oh no! That's annoying.

Like what amyhobbit said, if you're losing coverage you should be able to enroll during a Special Enrollment Period (aka you don't have to wait until Nov). 

Also, I ran a quote on www.healthsherpa.com. �� ☞

Based on the information you shared ���� it looks like you're able to save $236 per month on your premium! And there's a plan that only costs $43 per month. �� That seems pretty good. "
HealthInsurance,"The change you refer to from trump doesn’t take effect until 2019 keep your insurance "
HealthInsurance,"Yes because PT is considered 'conservative' treatment, meaning it's not invasive, doesn't require surgery etc. Many insurances require you to try it first to negate everyone with neck pain from getting expensive MRIs. In general, a few weeks of PT costs less to the insurance company than an MRI. "
HealthInsurance,"Where do you live? I am a licensed health advisor and I might be able to suggest some different options you may have, depending on what state you live in."
HealthInsurance,"/u/siphyre and /u/zebra-stampede, thanks for your replies.  I am aware that Obama raised the age limit from 25 to 26.  What I don't know is why that was needed.  Is there a law that says ""You have to kick kids off their parent's insurance at 26"" or were health insurance companies kicking kids off early, so they made a law that said ""you can not kick kids off their parents health insurance UNTIL 26.""  In addition to that, is there any history behind this?"
HealthInsurance,"https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2017/2017-09-07_open_enrollment_dates.htm


Nope, read here: Enrollment in the Essential Plan, Medicaid and Child Health Plus is open all year."
HealthInsurance,"What he said.  Your SBC (Summary of Benefits &amp; Coverage) lists all the details of exactly what is considered a ""qualifying event.""  changing coverage for any other reason has to wait until open enrollment"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  the marketplace plan available to him was about 20 or 30 bucks a month, 


that's what I'm seeing now. He's not *obliged* to elect COBRA.  Not sure what his former HR people are on about."
HealthInsurance,"Are you talking about your dental plan or your medical plan? Most dental plans don't cover anesthesia unless it's surgery.  Most medical plans don't cover anesthesia for dental work unless you have your wisdom teeth out (surgery).  There's really no insurance plan you can buy to cover it, but the dentist should have known this and given you an estimated cost before any work was done. 

For example, I have super excellent dental insurance (best you can buy - $20,000 annual maximum (yes all those zeros)) but I still have to foot the bill for when my 7 year old needs anesthesia for pulling one of her baby teeth.  "
HealthInsurance,"Unless OP qualifies for Medicaid- sometimes that will be backdated, usually about 3 months."
HealthInsurance,"[per healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/blog/qualifying-life-event-for-special-enrollment-period-2016/) “If you experience a qualifying event for health insurance — like getting married, having a baby, or losing other coverage — you may be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period. If you do, you can enroll in a Marketplace plan outside the annual Open Enrollment Period.”

It doesn’t specifically state divorce, but my workplace always lumps divorce in with it. (I work for Anthem BCBS) "
HealthInsurance,"Talk to your nephrologist’s office as well, if you’ve got ESRD you’re going to want to apply for Medicare."
HealthInsurance,"But if they're not ACA-compliant you're gonna get dinged by the tax penalty come tax day next year. That is still in effect for this year, fyi."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I'm mainly looking at general percent increases over particular time periods and exploring how they link with price gouging of drugs.

not sure you'll find a particularly strong correlation there, though that's a popular narrative for US health treatment costs. We don't consume that much more care than people in other developed economies - we just generally *pay* a lot more for what we get, in terms of health results"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Is my only option a private broker? 

Having a ""private broker"" or a magical wizard, won't secure you ACA qualifying coverage. You might obtain a short-term policy - which would provide coverage for 90 days or so, &amp; which would be renewable, but which almost certainly not cover treatment for the condition you're concerned about, as it pre-exists your enrollment.

But wait, it gets worse - Texas, a terrible place in which to look for individual health insurance coverage anyway, did NOT expand Medicaid coverage, so that wouldn't be a source for you even if your income was low enough to qualify elsewhere.

But stepdad's right - get attention to that thing. If stepdad can't provide tips on finding a specialist who'll give you a once-over at favorable cash-pay terms, [check locally for a community health center](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/). They may not provide care, but they often can provide intel on local clinicians who can help."
HealthInsurance,"An in network doctor is contractually required to accept whatever the insurance company determines to be the ""allowable amount"" for each procedure.

But that works both ways.  You should have been billed the whole $65 and he should have not been billing you $35.  I guess the doctor figured they'd make back what they lost on the first visits with what they gained on the last ones."
HealthInsurance,"Good rx is a good site.  Some pharmacies will take it and some not.  Go directly to the manufacturers website to inquire about a rebate plan.  I'll try to look it up for you tonight. "
HealthInsurance,"That is an assessment to see if you are eligible for medical assistance, not a medical assessment."
HealthInsurance,One thing you should also pay attention to is the network of providers offered by each of these plans.  PPO generally seemed to have larger networks than HMOs.  Checking to see if your current providers (since you want to stay with them) are in network is also an important part of choosing what plan to go with.
HealthInsurance,"Okay, so this is not an exact answer to your question, but a possible different way of solving your problem. Who is doing your billing? Is it in office, or Outsource sourced. If it is in office, then you probably have someone who is relatively inexperienced, as you are a new doctor. Ultimately, what you can do is Outsource your billing to a third party company that specializes in this. They will look at the notes, and look to see if you have coded correctly. They take a percentage of what you receive back in Billing. So they are incentivized to make sure that you get paid."

HealthInsurance,"As far as the conspiracy part of your question, data isn’t shared between a Federal Employee Plan covered by BC and a commercial plan. Even if they wanted to be that malicious the likelihood they have the ability to do that is very very low. "

HealthInsurance,"&gt; Level Self Funded plans

yeah, the vocabulary of the health benefits world is ... well... let's call it ""flexible"" ;-)

theses are often not really ""self-funded"" in a traditional sense."
HealthInsurance,"With no income, you should be available for medi-cal.  California's version of Medicaid.   E everything With no limit on when you can apply."
HealthInsurance,"uh, the other thing"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Also, in most states the individual plans are worse and more expensive than group plans.

Usually the opposite in terms of expense.  Individual plans are usually cheaper than group plans.  This is why people tend to opt out of COBRA coverage and purchase an individual plan instead.    "
HealthInsurance,Let me know what you figure out.  Also why can't I see the 3 comments?
HealthInsurance,"This is what SHRM suggests for employer's to require for a dependent eligibility audit:

This proof can include:

• A birth certificate.
• A marriage license.
• Court documents.
• Documentation that a dependent is a full-time student.

It's absolutely crazy to suggest that an employee upload tax returns and financial documentation when you're legally married. I'm surprised they'd want the responsibility.  Throw this link back at them and tell them ""NO"".

HealthInsurance,Have you shopped for plans on the marketplace or via a broker? You can probably find something for much less money than whatever plan your union is/will offer you. I feel like it's the missing link between the ALL or NOTHING choices you've given yourself.
HealthInsurance,"i'm not on bcbs or any marketplace plan. i've had a policy on my husband and i for 2 years now and it doesnt cost BOTH of us over 500. and i don't have to satisfy my deductible. insurance paid first on my last visit. depending on the state you are in, there are other options. (just don't put your phone number online!!! telemarketing nightmare there!)"
HealthInsurance,"OP, start here. more facts will get you more actionable responses - more than ""access to some really good plans"""
HealthInsurance,"Insurance is designed specifically to prevent this type of thing -- where people purchase only when they're sick and drop it after. 

Unless you have an event to open up a special enrollment period (new job, moving, marriage, divorce, etc), it's not going to be super easy. 

Depending on what all you anticipate you need done though, it may end up cheaper for you to be a cash paying patient (and things like www.goodrx.com)"
HealthInsurance,And thank goodness for that!
HealthInsurance,"Right. Sounds like the doctors office is charging you the billed rate, instead of the contract negotiated rate. Which is wrong. Good luck getting the refunds, always a hassle!"
HealthInsurance,"No, if the service was not subject to the deductible then it does not apply to the deductible."
HealthInsurance,"Well, the reason I ask, and I worded by question poorly, is because my wife owns her own company which provides insurance for her and her workers.  So, getting insurance through her company's plan means she's paying for it 100%.  I was wondering if we could save money by her getting it as an individual outside of the company."
HealthInsurance,That a fully functioning adult can't find and pay for their own health insurance? Yes. Baffle is the right word. Having adults stay without responsibility until they are 26+...what other term could you think of that explains my surprise as to why that's how it's become?
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I have supposed that paying the penalty will cost more than a couple months of health insurance premiums.

Hmmm. Not sure about this. If you do without coverage, you'll only NOT have coverage for 2 months longer than the ""permitted""  almost 3 month gap. is 1/6th of the penalty = 2 months of premiums?"
HealthInsurance,"Check your sbc and then call HR. Every company has different hoops you have to jump through. "
HealthInsurance,Open up a claim with your auto insurance and have them pay for it
HealthInsurance,Can you elaborate more by being Medicaid eligible?
HealthInsurance,"I pay $1200 per month (yes, one thousand two hundred) and have a $75 co-pay. My deductible for prescriptions is $500.  I’ve asked my doctors if they know of any better plans, “NO!” Asked the insurance agent if there are better plans, they’re all about the same.

And for the privilege of paying that much, in January they changed subscribers number without telling us, so claims were denied at first. I finally got the description of my plan yesterday, March 14, with a cover letter dated January 19. This is HealthNet, California. And not the highest level plan.

Insurance shouldn’t be a for-profit industry. And my doc said med school should be free cause they come out of med school about a million and a half in debt.  Is health care a right or a privilege?"
HealthInsurance,"I’m curious about this too. "

HealthInsurance,"Thank you. I was shocked as this has never happened. I was expecting all the hospital fees to be 100% as I went to my in network hospital, my doctor is in network.  I was only expecting to pay 20% of the professional fees. 

Should I contact my doctor or insurance? Or should I just wait for more EOBs and to see if I get a bill from the hospital? "
HealthInsurance,"Hard to know without the specifics but it sounds like this was covered under what's called 'RAPS'.  Many plans have this benefit. Basically what it means is that if you have a procedure done in a facility, if you need radiologist work, anesthesiologist, pathologist, or lab tech then even if they are out of network they will go toward your in network benefits.  The tricky part here is that even if it's going toward your in network benefits, that does not mean that there is a contract (your carrier wont be able to adjust the rate, but they will still pay 100% of the 'allowed amount').  It sounds like they charged $7.27 more than what the allowed amount is, but they are allowed to do that because they don't have a contract.  Sorry if this is confusing, feel free to ask if you need more clarification; RAPS processing can be complicated. "
HealthInsurance,Can you buy supplemental (or a different insurance) that covers out of pocket expenses like the anesthesia?
HealthInsurance,"You can appeal their denial. Did you call 911 or anything like that when you found him? "
HealthInsurance,"Well he can appeal the decision if he believes his income will be lower this year than they think. 

Besides that a change in tax credits is an officially recognized [qualifying life event for a special enrollment period](https://www.wahbexchange.org/new-customers/who-can-sign-up/special-enrollment-period/) and he can choose a new plan.

The plans w/o a tax credit will still likely be more than he was paying, but he does have options. "

HealthInsurance,"First of all, ouch! Is it feasible for him to stay on at his job for a while unless he's healed? Totally understand there are additional costs of keeping two residences and such (not to mention the emotional strain of being long-distance), but I would get an idea of how long his recovery will be and weigh the costs and benefits of each option. 

If he leaves, he can do COBRA via his employer's plan (but FYI COBRA includes a 2% admin fee on top of paying 100% of the premium). Or he'll be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period in the Marketplace because he'll have moved. ACA forbids insurers to deny coverage due to preexisting conditions, so you're fine there. When I had to make this decision I opted for ACA to save money (I got a catastrophic plan but this would not be good for him. I had no current or foreeseeable major medical expenses.) This may be helpful: https://www.healthsherpa.com/blog/cobra-health-insurance-aca-better/

As for minimizing costs, you'll have to compare the plans and see what the out-of-pocket costs are for what he needs. There are also subsidies if you do a Marketplace plan. "

HealthInsurance,"As a billing specialist for a physician, I can tell you that insurance companies do not care if you have paid on the procedure when they are processing the claim. It makes absolutely no difference on how it is processed. 
Very simply put, you are being asked to pay up front because in this age of high deductibles, if it isn’t collected up front, it is never collected at all."
HealthInsurance,"Seems typical.  I always tell folks it's $1,000 for the ER to just walk in the door."
HealthInsurance,Can you suggest a place to shop for health insurance directly? I think what I am mostly looking for is a cheap catastrophic plan.
HealthInsurance,"I can only imagine how pissed you are considering I once developed what I now know to be as melasma (hyperpigmentation of the skin) on my forehead, and when my alarmist husband told me “it could be a fungus,” I bolted to the urgent care down the road. The on call doc, who had the face of a 7th grader, didn’t do much more than shrug and say, “doesn’t look like any fungus I’ve ever seen,” before telling me he could prescribe nothing. It pained me to fork over my $30 copay which I could’ve bypassed had I gone straight to the dermatologist (no referral needed). Incidentally, the cream I used to clear the issue was $26 on Amazon Prime. Gotta love healthcare. "

HealthInsurance,"&gt;there's no real break-down of the other numbers. They seem practically random -- like, they could have put almost any number in the examples for the deductible and co-payments.

I think, if you take 
""pencil &amp; paper"" - or a spreadsheet - and work through the examples for given plans, you'll get a ballpark sense that they tend to stick close to how a plan's cost-sharing provisions apply to the case  examples. 

Source? I've done it, though not recently"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah the website is total garbage and super confusing. I found out my eligibility through Health First Colorado, and the person I spoke with told me it was now in Medicaid's hands and they would contact me. When they didn't, I called them probably 10 times and left a message each time, and nobody ever called me back. I then was out of the country for a month, and by the time I returned, the enrollment window had closed.

When I started a new job, I began the application process all over again, but I now somehow am no longer eligible for Medicaid."
HealthInsurance,"This appears to simply three wholly separate bills/charges from 3 wholly separate entities - which is entirely normal/typical when you receive care in the ER.  Just spitballing here, but I suspect:

Jewish Hospital $694.80 - facility ER charges

UC Health $154 - ER physician charges

Mercy Health $113.36 - perhaps labs, xray, or some other ancillary charges.

You have (at least) 2 EOBs, one showing you owe $113.36 (to... someone) and $139.10 (to someone else, presumably).  So far - you only owe the sum of those two - between perhaps 2 different providers.

You made no mistakes or anything wrong.  And you leaving your job or vacation time or whatever has absolutely no effect.

Match your EOBs to each corresponding bill if you can.  You should expect to see at least one more for the 3rd provider.  You may want to call your insurer to go over each EOB and bill to match them together and then pay what the insurance company says you owe (not what the provider says you owe)."
HealthInsurance,"anything  labeled HDHP had better be a High Deductible Health Plan.

and you know you'll never need medications whose prices strain your budget, because.... well, because as far as I can tell you really don't understand the concept of insurance. If you KNOW what will happen you don't need insurance. But you don't **know**. So....."
HealthInsurance,"If it's an FSA, I'd start with conservative contributions, since FSA money does *not* roll over year to year. I'd leave it at whatever the deductible is, and if you end up needing more you can always alter your contribution level later in the year. "
HealthInsurance,"So, what you're being offered sounds like short-term non-compliant plans.  Essentially, these plans won't cover anything pre-existing, will fight to make sure that they can classify everything as pre-existing, and won't save you from the tax penalty.

The correct way to apply is through the exchange.  Do you get insurance through work, or do you need to apply on your own.  What is your income situation and state of residence.  "
HealthInsurance,"Hi AgentMonkey - thanks for the response, very helpful. 

Our out of pocket maximum is $5,200. After we hit our deductible my responsibility is 10% coinsurance. 

I guess my question is this - my wife's procedure will put us over the deductible; will the insurance company charge the 100% for the portion not yet at deductible, and remove 90% of the cost on the remaining amount after I hit the deductible? 

Thanks again!"
HealthInsurance,Not a legitimate question scrub.

HealthInsurance,Your chiropractor did you a MASSIVE favor.  Quick complaining.
HealthInsurance,"I'm also confused as to why the PPO is less expensive than the HDHP/HSA plan, but if that's accurate the PPO looks to be the plan that will benefit you most. Especially based on the assumption that some services, like doctor/specialist office visit co-pays, are not subject to the 1k deductible. By any chance are you leaving out a contribution by the company into your HSA if you choose that plan? The real benefit of the HSA option is the ability to direct pre-tax monies into that account for future pre-tax use."
HealthInsurance,"Let me repeat myself for emphasis:

&gt;The plan ***I’m*** on puts your in network paid amounts towards your out of network deductible and max OOP. And ***if*** this surgery is considered “emergency” they ***may*** do extended in network. They covered my ambulance and the anesthesiologists with extended in network coverage since my gall bladder was considered an emergency.

Are you arguing that the amount charged by balance billing does not count toward your out of network OOP and/or deductible just like my in network pre-deductible amount billed does? "
HealthInsurance,"Call Medicare back and ask why you aren't eligible for B up until A expires in August. Loss of COBRA  should be a qualifying event to go back on B. If they still say you can't get B, insist on speaking with a manager and have them explain why you are still on A. Tell them it's keeping you from getting an individual policy and this is life threatening.

Also look up the manufacturers for your meds and see if they have a program to help people without insurance or with high deductibles. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you very much for your advice.

I'm just don't know much about health insurance and wondering what my best course of action could be right now.

I know that I would feel better knowing that my health insurance is very very good and that if for some reason I lose my job I'll be able to get some top quality medical help.

I don't trust my employer, they lie and always provide the minimum necessary required by law so I'm making a guess and saying that this insurance they are providing is just bad?

They don't offer dental nor vision nor options to get coverage even if I paid for it.

I sure I'm gonna need many expensive procedures this year and was wondering if I could take advantage somehow of the fact that there's still no medical record of cancer (get a really good health insurance for a normal ""You are a healthy person"" price). 

So could I just go with any health insurance provider and get their premium package? I wouldn't mind paying 1k or 2k a month just for peace of mind.

Thanks for reading."

HealthInsurance,"The health insurance system is just all wrong. I went through the same thing as you. I was paying $380/month for a high deductible insurance. I pretty much ended up paying for everything myself. To actually get decent insurance, I would've had to pay $600/month. Healthcare in the U.S. is overly complicated and expensive. It takes 1-2 weeks to get an appointment. If you are in need of medication in the middle of the night, the only way is to go to an emergency and pay $3,000. I mean, there should be 24 hour pharmacies. Something is just not right about this system.

Yes. Not sure why Sandbocks couldn't confirm that. all Summaries of Benefits and Coverage (SBCs) for ALL health coverage - not merely Marketplace plans - include these same examples, customized to the terms of the plan the SBC summarizes"
HealthInsurance,"Ok. You should check with your mom’s employer’s plan. Simply because employers are offering plans that are limiting networks to local areas, so in TX he may not be covered or could be considered Out of Network. If you mom’s plan is a plan that offers a National Network, then there should not be any issues. 

If you have a copy of the plan design I would gladly take a look, but would still request that you check with your mom’s HR department "

HealthInsurance,"Terminate your marketplace plan after you have your new ID card or other confirmation or proof of coverage.

Was in a similar situation and they cancelled retroactive to the date of my new coverage after submitting proof.   Did the cancellation over the phone.

Keep in mind your subsidized premium is an advance on a tax credit that you'll compute on your 2018 tax return.  It will be based on your income for the year, and not your month to month income.  So if your income is high enough you could end up owning all of the advance credits you received back.  So save up some money, or have extra withheld this year (you do this on the W-4 form you'll fill out at your new job) and be prepared."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, I'm not sure that would work for me. I can't recall the last time I was ill, but I do have a back issue. When I lost my insurance last year I was going back and forth between my primary doctor, a neurosurgeon, a pain management specialist and doing physical therapy. The only one that ended up being covered by the new plan I got was my primary doctor, who I saw the least.

I'm totally to blame for not asking more specific questions of the insurance agent in order to make sure the specific doctors I had been seeing were covered by my specific plan. They all accepted Blue Cross, just not the plan I chose. I was in such a rush to get coverage so I could continue my treatment, and then I couldn't continue. At least not in the way that I had been. So, lesson learned for renewal time..."
HealthInsurance,"Why would you rather not have insurance? That's a bad stance to take.

HealthInsurance,"&gt; Unless you have a qualifying life event to open a special enrollment period, you likely can't access anything on the marketplace.

Divorce is a qualifying life event. I've already spoken to someone about it, albeit that was a couple of months ago when I didn't have an exact date for divorce.

HealthInsurance,"I believe the majority of plans for larger corporations are self funded and some medium size businesses self fund as well.  Most of them use an insurance company to administer the claims so it is almost transparent to providers and users that the plan is self funded.

Also, if your employer based plan meets certain ""affordability"" and other standards you won't be able to receive any savings or premium credits on an ACA marketplace plan.

As others have said, a self funded plan isn't any different from a partially or fully insured plan, and usually the fact that it is self-funded is transparent to the employee.  If you're concerned about what coverage is offered then look at the plan document or plan summary to see what the benefits and exclusions are."

HealthInsurance,"Which state do you live in?  "
HealthInsurance,I'm an NY resident. My stay in Mass will be temporary and probably in an AirBnB. Does this impact coverage eligibility?
HealthInsurance,"&gt;does anyone know if you can go to urgent care to ask for sleeping pills

You can always ask, but don't expect any reputable clinician to fill a script simply because you ask for it. That's not the function of, y'know, the medical profession."
HealthInsurance,If you don't qualify for a special enrollment period you can still buy temporary health insurance - best bought face to face with a local insurance broker.  But ask for details on the policy. They generally are not expensive but do not cover routine medical care and really only protect against a major problem with relatively low coverage caps and in very limited circumstances and do not cover pre-existing conditions.
HealthInsurance,"I just want to point out that you are obviously pissed at UHC but reading between the lines i dont think anything was necessarily their fault. Just because you think something is medically necessary, and (this one is hard to swallow) just because an MD thinks it is, doesnt automatically make insurance cover it. UHC will have guidelines in place for something like that. To dumb it down their guidelines will say that the patient must meet criteria X, Y, Z. Maybe your doctor didnt submit any records initially, maybe they didnt send enough, maybe you only met criteria X, Y, but not Z. Its really hard to know without getting a direct answer from UHC. 

That being said, have you received ANY paperwork from UHC? An EOB? A letter detailing the denial of the prior authorization? You will have appeal rights if they denied something where you can present all those records from your MD to prove medical necessity. "
HealthInsurance,Moving back to the states should be a qualifying event for enrollment outside of the normal Open Enrollment in Nov. I'd go to www.healthcare.gov and apply for coverage. You probably need to have your new US address handy.
HealthInsurance,Oh I hope that's what it means. It's the Bronze Plan for United Health Care. I'm in Westchester County. Thanks for your help stranger!
HealthInsurance,"Hmm... that's an odd request. I've certainly never heard of an employer requiring that amount of information for an Eligibility Audit.  Go back to HR and tell them ""NO"".  I'm sure that the 3rd party is suggesting they request this information from their employees and it's not the employer's idea. Someone needs to push back and tell them no way in hell.  

Your next question will be ""can they deny my wife's enrollment?"" Well, they'd be up for a big battle there.  Why they need all of that information to prove she's legal just doesn't make sense.  If you file a tax return jointly or provide a marriage certificate that should be enough.  Do they actually think you'd be trying to screw with the IRS? 

Sounds like the employer is desperate to reduce their portion of premiums.  I'd pitch an absolute fit about it."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, ""better"" doctors was my guess, I just don't think that that's super relevant to me because I don't have pre-existing relationships with particular doctors so I feel like the network doesn't matter much? So would it make sense just to get the cheapest premium platinum plan?"
HealthInsurance,"Dental coverage is typically different than major medical coverage. That said, are you sure it's not just billed as out of network? That's common for radiologist, anesthesiologists, etc. 

Or it's possible it's not a traditionally covered service for the dental service of tooth pulling depending on the anesthesia. Though she is four, so to expect otherwise is kind of rough, IMO. 

What specifically did the EOB say when it denied coverage?"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,Have all of the EOBs posted to the online account portal?
HealthInsurance,"Update! I spoke to insurance and they said it was denied because the surgeon had not submitted her billing yet, but anaesthia had so therefore they had to deny it. The surgery is still being processed by my insurance and they will send the other bill back for review."
HealthInsurance,You can't get a taxpayer identification number and do it that way?
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,You've misunderstood or applied somewhere else. Healthcare.gov would never need a medical assessment. All of the plans are guaranteed issue.

HealthInsurance,"New York State, about $70k"
HealthInsurance,"Excellent points. Smaller company, not experience rated, so moot point. However, in the small group world you could run into some leaner coverage options."
HealthInsurance,"Agree. Provider’s liable and if they don’t approve, you won’t be charged."
HealthInsurance,"Sounds like you may be mixing up the ""look back method"" with ""retroactive coverage"".  The look back method w/the ACA is one measurement employers can use to determine ACA eligibility for new hires. 
 
Retroactive coverage is what you're talking aout, but it usually only comes up when you're talking about full Medicaid. Some states will retroacitively cover 3 months back from the date of your application, depending on the circumstances.  If you qualify for a marketplace plan, you are likely over the limit to qualify for Medicaid coverage.

With employer sponsored healthcare, the only time you'll get retroactive coverage is when there's a paperwork issue or some other delay in processing your application past your effective date.  Your coverage will be retroactive to your effective date. 

If you're signing up through the marketplace on your own (sounds like that's what you're doing), your effective date is your effective date and there is no retroactive coverage.  When it first came out, the marketplace had a lot of issues so they were retroactively covering things (especially emergencies, but not in all states) if your coverage was determined to be delayed due to their data error.  As far as I'm aware, that general policy is no longer in effect but it may depend on your specific plan/carrier.  

Regardless, they're currently still required to cover you for pre-existing conditions so as long as the need for surgery isn't life threatening/urgent, you might be better off if you post-pone to after your coverage begins.  

If that's not an option and you have to do it self-pay, you should let Patient Financial Services/your surgeon's billing department know about the lapse in coverage.  They'll probably be able to work out an affordable payment plan for you, possibly even with a discount.  Sometimes they'll try submitting the claim to your insurance first to see if they'll retroactively cover.

HealthInsurance,"&gt; It's been my experience that double coverage doesn't really do much in the grand scheme of things

this, for at least 20 years. Most employer plans moved to ""non-dup"" coordination of benefits ages ago, meaning having secondary coverage lost a lot of its value ages ago"
HealthInsurance,"The good thing is, since she's not yet 65, she can likely get onto Medicaid via MAGI eligibility, so her assets would not count against her, then when she turns 65, she can cancel Medicaid and move to Medicare. (If she still has lots of assets, she will likely no longer be eligible for Medicaid upon turning 65.) She can then choose from among Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Supplements, or just have Traditional Medicare."
HealthInsurance,"I paid the copay and a bill I did get from urgent care last year which insurance did not fully cover. I had a deductible as well, but when I still had the insurance this new charge was not part of what I was expected to pay.

I should add - according to the urgent care, insurance did not cover this bill because of ""lapse of coverage"" but I was insured by the company at the time I saw the doctor."
HealthInsurance,The original poster is taking offense at everything and being rude and ungrateful and unhelpful. I'm locking the thread.
HealthInsurance,They should tell your but in several doctors offices I’ve seen signs saying it’s ultimately the patient’s responsibility to verify coverage.
HealthInsurance,"You repeating for emphasis added nothing because (my turn):

&gt; Neither of those situations applies to OP.

As for your comment:

&gt; Are you arguing that the amount charged by balance billing does not count toward your out of network OOP and/or deductible just like my in network pre-deductible amount billed does?

That’s exactly what I’m saying because that’s exactly how out of network works. That’s what makes it balance billing. The insurance will “price” the claim using a variety of pricing techniques to determine what’s considered a fair “allowable.” They have to calculate an allowable because they’re not going to process on the billed charges.

Easy numbers.

You have a $10 out of network deductible. You have 80/20 coinsurance like OP allegedly does. You have a $50 out of network OOP. Let’s assume deductible doesn’t contribute to OOP.

The insurance gets the claim in for a major surgery and the out of network doctor bills $10,000. The insurance prices the claim. Perhaps the rate they come back with is $1,000 for a fair amount. That $1,000 is the allowable.

$10 goes toward deductible.

$990 left.

You would owe 20% of the remaining _allowable_ up to your out of network OOP. So $250 would be portioned off from the $990. $50 (20% of that $250) would meet your OOP, and the insurance would pay the 80%.

That leaves $740 left over. Since your out of network OOP has been met, your insurance would pay 100% of the _allowable_. Full stop. That extra $9,000 the doctor billed for? You’re on the hook for that. The insurance ain’t going to do crap about it because (in OP’s situation) you _chose_ to see an out of network provider so you also by extension _chose_ to eat that cost. Your end cost is $10 for the deductible, $50 for your coinsurance, and _whatever the doctor decides to bill you above the allowable_. That’s how it works. That’s how it has always worked.

There may have been negotiation with out of network providers for your specific situation and the allowables may have increased after you were balance billed, but that is a common characteristic of emergency claims being treated as in network. That would not in any way apply to OP’s situation because allowing the full billed charges from the outset or even reprocessing an out of network claim to allow more simply because the customer had been balance billed would undermine the entire concept of networks. Every doctor would stop contracting because in network doctors would be the suckers who accept a negotiated rate while out of network doctors can bill whatever they want and get 100% of it. 

Just to one-and-done this, I’m also tagging u/Interquestions and u/nbphotography87. I have to explain out of network allowables in depth like this at least once every three weeks and I don’t honestly know why. 

Out of network claims are priced to prevent insurance companies going insolvent from excessive billing. You will very likely owe anything above the allowed amount. The amount above the allowable will not be applied to deductible, coinsurance, or OOP. /thread"
HealthInsurance,"See if you'd qualify for Medicaid.  Sometimes married couples do make a low enough combined incomes that they can both qualify.  Contact your local health and human services/social services to see what the income brackets are.  

If not, and your mom isn't planning on going on Medicare (or is staying employed with employer coverage still) chip in some money to stay on her plan if you want to help her out with the costs.  This might be cheaper and you can stay on her plan regardless of student status or marital status until age 26.

Otherwise log into the insurance Marketplace.  Go armed with with each of your incomes will be.  Chances are you will qualify for some subsidies to help with the cost.  If either of you qualify for employer sponsored coverage this might be a cheaper option as the employer pays part of the cost and it comes out pre-tax which can help out with your income bracket.

Congratulations on your upcoming wedding!  It's an exciting time.  Remember that for commercial insurance once you get married you will qualify for a special enrollment period. "
HealthInsurance,Except in PA - children can be held responsible for parents medical debt in certain scenarios. Good old PA
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the reply.

So if you where in my situation you would simply schedule a doctor appointment ASAP and let my current insurance handle the situation? 

Would you do something different?"
HealthInsurance,Is it possible for you to tell us a little bit more about what treatment you're seeking?  As daneslord mentioned an insurer will only pay for medically necessary care - Not purely cosmetic procedures.
HealthInsurance,"Without your EOC (evidence of coverage) it’s difficult to say. But typically yes. You pay 100% of the contacted rate until you reach your dedu, then you’ll pay 10% of the contracted cost. 

I personally hate it when hospitals or doctors charge up front. Because they rarely put on the claim that you have already paid into the procedure and then we(insurance company) only see what you owe total, but no record that you’ve already paid on it. It relies on faith from your facility/doctor that they will bill you the difference of the cost and not the full cost again. 

Unless you have a copay for that MRI I see no reason why you should be paying up front. Maybe ask the hospital why? If they refuse unless you pay upfront I would at least get a receipt that way you have proof you paid on the procedure. "
HealthInsurance,Thanks!

However, because you are technically not a salaried employee, you need to submit an application based on your taxable income.

HealthInsurance,"well, be shopping ACA coverage - in your situation, your forecast of income should qualify you for premium subsidies that would make longer-term coverage affordable, even as you job-hunt"
HealthInsurance,"As you said, this is probably considered a freestanding ER. It's usually the same cost as if you were to go to a regular ER in the hospital. I'm not surprised at the charges you listed for an ER visit.

Next time make sure you go to a walk in, urgent care, or even a cvs minute clinic and it will be a fraction of the cost of the ER.
"
HealthInsurance,"This is a stretch, but would the urgent care have a copy of the front and back of the card you provided at the appointment? Or any other doctor you saw while that insurance was active?

Or, did you make an online member services login? I'm just trying to think of simple ways for you to locate your information, instead of being stuck in an annoying phone loop. 

Or, call anthem and give them your SSN to locate your policy if you dont have your id #? 

Good luck! Hope you can find what you need. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;are these examples actually meaningful when comparing plans, or are they kind of useless? :-o

How useful are nutrition labels on grocery products you might purchase?

Short answer: not entirely useless - it depends to some degree on how ""classically rational"" you want to be in making coverage choices"
HealthInsurance,"I hope it was a mistake, but the bill definitely says DENIED. 
Today is the day I call. Please wish me luck!"
HealthInsurance,"Yes. My own coverage cost hasn't changed much, and it was very affordable when my income was much higher.  Not quite as affordable these days though."
HealthInsurance,"If the insurance is requesting information from the patient(usually an incident report that can actually be done over the  phone) our clinic will usually wait ~60 days. If we call the insurance and they confirm they haven't received anything from the patient will move it to Patient responsibility with a notation stating they need to call their insurance. We found that a lot of times patients will ignore/immediately toss paperwork from their insurance but when they get a bill from their doctor they pay attention. It almost sounds like the same situation here. 

But also echoing what other people have said on this thread, the balance is your mom's not yours. We've had collections balances that we've had to write off due to Patient death. Do NOT pay but it would be very kind you to help the clinic get paid."

HealthInsurance,"&gt; My mom is retired and turning 65 next year

As I said, the devil is in the details - &amp; this detail is big. You're right, once she is ON Medicare you wouldn't have the option of being covered under her plan. And marketplace coverage for someone her age CAN be very expensive - depending on the premium credits she's eligible for, which depends on her income. She MIGHT be paying next to nothing for the coverage she - and you - have now.
 
&gt; We’re also located in KY, if that helps!

Well, it helps to know where you are - but your current governor is doing everything he can to ruin the good thing his predecessor got going under ACA, so in that sense it's NOT good that you're in  KY.

I moved you to Louisville, made you both mid-20s - I'm seeing premium rates after credits from $3 to about $250, with just over a dozen plans available. Not too shabby. Those #s may change for elections you might make in November"
HealthInsurance,"Ok a few things, the employer has to BY LAW provide you with an SBC (Summary of Benefits and Coverage): https://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/aba_health_esource_home/aba_health_law_esource_0712_patterson.html

I'm not an expert in Illinois law and I'm flabbergasted that BCBS of IL doesn't have 2018 SBCs on their website (the latest SBCs listed are from 2016), but she should be able to get an SBC with little to no problem. Can she log into her account on the BCBSIL website? That is something she should be able to do without input from her mother (dependents over the age of 18 have to give permission to access personal health info so she should have her own log-in).

Some plans DO deny pregnancy coverage for dependents, however most of the plans I've encountered cover pregancy, they just don't cover the baby once delivered.

HealthInsurance,"Claim processing is made easier by today’s technology. It takes less than a minute to verify, process, and file a claim. My employer has a division that does this. "

I'm definitely not complaining, just wondering about the legality of all of it.

But regardless of what plan you pick I would always contribute the maximum rollover amount that is tax sheltered. The caveat would be your multi-year plan to be with this employer, as FSAs aren’t owned by the individual and that account isn’t portable if you leave your company. Then again, it’s $500."

HealthInsurance,"Of course. Find a provider that has good base coverage and will allow you to see a primary care physician(PCP) of your choosing.  You'll need to start with your PCP to get in to see a geneticist.  And be prepared to wait. It can take months to get in, and that's only once your PCP has determined your need. Which, again,  can take a few months.

Do you already have a Dr.?"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks so much for the information!  I'll definitely ask about the codes.  Please humor me with this question: in order to fulfill medical necessity, what do they generally diagnose people with?  Meaning, if I don't have an obvious anxiety disorder, or depression, or schizophrenia, or something that requires medication (etc.), but just need to ""work through"" some underlying issues that are impacting mental well-being?  Are those codes appropriate for such cases?"
HealthInsurance,"Yup, you are in the ""unsweet"" spot.  Subsidies were supposed to keep the premiums affordable, but the system wasn't designed for the individual market to spiral like it has.  So people like yourself end up paying a huge amount for insurance, because it wasn't originally estimated that the cost of insurance would exceed 8% of your income for someone in your bracket.  

So your employer doesn't offer insurance....you could always talk to them about getting coverage under SHOP. It tends to make things easier and cheaper for smaller companies.  "

HealthInsurance,You can't change now without a qualifying event - But there are several plans offered by Oscar that cost less than $300 per month.  There was also a BCBS Bronze plan that would have been $404 per month.  For $550 per month you could have gotten a BCBS plan that had a deductible of $350 per month.  When open enrollment starts again in the fall try posting here again and we can look at your options and try and find you something better.
HealthInsurance,"As I had posted earlier, my wife was the one who called and I'm going to call once I get off work.

She was told the tooth extraction procedure was covered by our dental insurance and health insurance covered the actual hospital visit. 

She's having to be put to sleep in the hospital because the oral surgeon couldn't do the procedure at his office. He didn't have the tools to put her to sleep safely, etc. at his office. 

Our health insurance covers the hospital room. The anesthesia, and just now found out we have to pay the nurse too, was like $1400 something out of pocket. "
HealthInsurance,"Can't say it is  ""the right"" plan, but I have a similar catastrophic Kaiser plan in California (slightly more expensive but otherwise similar). Mine specifically says I get 3 primary care visits on top of preventive care, so I feel pretty covered on that end as long as I don't have a medical emergency. Are you needing just a regular doc or specialists? "
HealthInsurance,"The provider will file a claim with your insurance if they're in network because that's a stipulation of their contract. Sometimes they'll do it for you for out of network if they're nice. But it's never the provider's responsibility to verify in-network status for you. Onus is on you. You can certainly ask them to work out a payment plan or knock off a percentage of the bill for a cash paying patient. "

HealthInsurance,"So I spoke with a manager at Medicare. He told me it is true that Medicare Part A expires 36 months after transplants for people who are medicare because of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), which I was. BUT he did some digging and records show I was put on disability/medicare for a disability other than ESRD, which is a COMPLETE mystery to me. I've never been diagnosed with a disability other than ESRD. I'm under 65, I'm not blind, no ALS, etc. I think there's been some kind of clerical error on someone's part. He told me they get their updates from Social Security and to speak with a supervisor there so now I'm on hold with them (been on hold for 1 hour+).

To make things worse, when I went to Social Security in person last week to explain that I shouldn't have Part A, they made me sign a statement saying i'm ""refusing Medicare benefits"". When I spoke to NYS of Health, they told me that ""opting out"" of Medicare will also make me ineligible for health insurance. So, when that request to disenroll gets processed, I won't even have Medicare Part A AND I won't be eligible for other health insurance. 

Right now i'm trying to concentrate on making sure I have my meds. Walgreens is telling me my prograf comes out to $4,133 so that's fun. 

TLDR: I should not even have Medicare Part A. Someone somewhere marked down that I have a disability other than ESRD. I've found myself waiting for hours in offices and on phones to get tiny amounts of mostly unhelpful information.

HealthInsurance,"I joined a large practice. There are billing people in house. They really don’t send us charts back for icd 10 codes other than to say “don’t use unspecified codes.” 

But I bet they could help me make sure my codes are correct if I asked them. That’s a good thought. "
HealthInsurance,"Congrats on the new job!

&gt; I do not pay the deductible?

Then you get sent to collections and eventually join the statistic of medical bankruptcies.  Or just have people calling you over and over until they screw up and break a collections law or run out of time and sell it to a different collection agency.  That's money you owe the hospital.

&gt; Do deducible being met usually mean that the rest of your care is 100% paid for?

Depends on the plan, many ""high deductible health plans"" have the deductible and the out-of-pocket limit be the same, so when you used up the deductible you paid nothing else, but most plans have copays (especially drug copays) or a coinsurance percentage (you pay 20% or so) between hitting your deductible and hitting the out-of-pocket limit.

You're going to have to find your current plan's documentation and figure out whether the $ premium per month plus what(if anything) you'll have to pay for for the rest of the year is worth  keeping. If you switch you start all over from 0 on the new plan and have to meet your deductible again, so remember to include the new deductible with the monthly costs for comparison."
HealthInsurance,"My husband works for a small business that has mostly family working for it, so the policies offered were chosen with everyone's input on what they wanted offered. They also pay 75% of the premium, so we are VERY fortunate. I work for an insurance company, and we pay less and have better coverage with his job's insurance than the best plan on offer with my employer."
HealthInsurance,"It's apparently a growing practice with health care providers, especially in instances with higher deductible plans, as many people are not paying their portion of the bill. The deposit you pay SHOULD be an estimate of what your responsibility will be for all of the services rendered after insurance makes their payment. Assuming you are at an in-network provider, the allowed amount is almost always way less than what the provider actually bills, the insurance will pay their responsibility of that allowed, and you will pay the difference (deductible/copay/coinsurance, whichever is applicable per your plan). Any amount you overpay from your deposit will be refunded to you by the provider. Definitely keep track of all your EOBs."
HealthInsurance,Wow that is so helpful. Thank you for finding that!
HealthInsurance,Preexisting conditions no longer are a factor in determining health insurance. You can buy insurance through your state’s exchange or directly though if you buy directly you won’t get state subsidies if your income is below a certain level though that varies by state.
HealthInsurance,I just find it surprising that this one visit didn't get billed. My daughter has been going to the hospital organization since she was born. Could it be that they initially put her in the registrar with a misspelled name? For an hour they couldn't find her lab records until the doctor saw my employee badge
HealthInsurance,"Everything is subject to the $6,550 deductible (you have to pay that amount) before anything is covered, EXCEPT preventive services (https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/) and a limited number of generic drugs.  

This is a good example: If you go to an in network doc for a sinus infection you'll pay the negotiated rate (retail is probably $150-$200) - which will be somewhere around $100.  He/She will give you an RX for a generic antibiotic, if that's RX is on the limited generic list it'll be free.  If it's not, go to Walmart or Target and get it for $4. If you get more expensive drugs shop around - but you're paying the negotiated rate for the med (full price minus any discount the insurance company gets).

It's a decent plan but that $6,550 scares people.  On the other hand, if you get hit by a car and go to an in-network facility you'll pay $6,550 for your entire visit.

It's important to note that there are NO out of network benefits.  Stay in network and you'll be ok.  You can also put some money into a Health Savings Account to pay for the deductible. If it's through your employer you may be able to have those HSA funds taken out of your paycheck pre-tax.  If not, you can claim the HSA contributions on next year's taxes. The money rolls over every year and it's a nice way to save.  The money can be used for any HSA eligible expenses - including dental."
HealthInsurance,"Reading over your situation, from my experience you might be better off looking into private insurance!"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Is health care a right or a privilege?

Depends if you ask a rich Republican congressman who gets some of the best coverage in the country, or an average citizen who pays a huge percentage of their wages for insurance and still has to most of their medical expenses out of pocket in the most confusing medical billing system in the world.

"
HealthInsurance,"Cancer sucks... sorry to hear that your family is going through this. 

Here are the answers to your questions. 

1. You cannot request your father to be Inpatient in a hospital, unless this is medical necessary for treatment. I would talk to his doctor (with approval from your father) if you feel that his condition does warrant a hospital stay or a stay in a long term facility. 

2. Same as above... although I think his doctor will have an easier time approving this through his insurance company. 

3. I assume you believe that by moving in with you he would lose insurance though your mom’s employer? He would not, assuming they are not getting a divorce? 

4. As long as he is remaining on your mom insurance, he wouldn’t need his own policy... per answer to your question 3. 

Hopefully this was helpful?"
HealthInsurance,I don't know a lot of people that go into urgent care for a cold or flu. Poor people usually do that because they can't afford healthcare that allows quick doctor's visits.
HealthInsurance,"The pregnancy and birth will be covered under your parents' insurance, assuming you are still under 26 when you give birth. The baby, though, will not be covered under your parents' plan."
HealthInsurance,"Insurances were kicking off kids. They would also kick anyone off or gave trouble to anyone who had preexisting conditions as well. It was basically all about the money, insurance companies are extremely scummy. "
HealthInsurance,When did you apply?  Also did you recently lose coverage?
HealthInsurance,"don't believe everything you hear, and NOTHING of what he says

penalty isn't eliminated until twentyNINETEEN tax year"

HealthInsurance,"I live in a state with many options.  I have a chronic illness and my job pays shit and I'm single.  For the past few years, I was paying around $45 per month and this year I somehow managed to find a really decent plan for $19 per month.  No deductible, but OOP at $1250 which I meet in the first month due to a specific medication."
HealthInsurance,"You'd have to try to find out if they're managed by the same group or in the same hospital system. You could probably find that online. 

As far as the EMR system, probably can't do that without calling them. "
HealthInsurance,"I’ve worked in the industry for years. It doesn’t work the same way. Please google “balance billing.”

In network deductible going toward out and/or vice versa is called cross accumulation and it’s not a guarantee with any plan. And yes emergency coverage has to be covered as in network per federal mandate. Neither of those situations applies to OP. Seriously, please google “balance billing” so this doesn’t come back to bite you at some point in the future. There is a world of difference between out of network and in."
HealthInsurance,"Oh really? I didn’t know you could do that. Thanks. "
HealthInsurance,"If you don't pay the deductible, the hospital will eventually send the bill to collections. 

After you meet the deductible, your plan pays for your care at the percentage dictated by the plan. Generally silver plans are 70/30 cost share, so you are responsible for 30% of charges. But this will be outlined in the specific details of your plan. 

After you meet the out of pocket, then your care is paid for at 100%. "
HealthInsurance,"Actually, I'm exempt from the penalty due to low income/unaffordable insurance.

I was hoping for info on private insurers, but thanks. "
HealthInsurance,"you can get ACA if you have moved , changed zip codes/counties, "
HealthInsurance,You won't be able to signup for coverage again until open enrollment - But it wouldn't preclude you from buying coverage next year - Assuming the current law doesn't change.
HealthInsurance,"To answer the rest of your question - It's difficult to tell without knowing more about your him - Age, income, where he lives, does he smoke, etc. - Those prices are fairly normal - The individual insurance market has seen some high rate increases over the past few years.  It's also possible that he might be getting a smaller subsidy because of an increase in his income "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;So, are these examples actually meaningful when comparing plans, or are they kind of useless?

I'm not sure how to answer that.  But here's what I can tell you.

The examples are regulated.  These SBCs (summary of benefits and coverage) came about as part of the ACA and there are very specific rules about what all SBCs must look like.

The intent behind it is that it makes it easier/simpler to compare plans across carriers because they all have to use the exact same format.  The problem (to some) is that the format isn't always ideal for any particular plan design.  And those coverage examples have to make certain assumptions.

The examples assume, for the condition shown, X number of office visits, X prescription drugs (if any), the assumed cost/allowed amount, etc.

There is an exceedingly complicated formula where the plan's basic numbers are plugged in (deductible, coinsurance, copays, etc.) that spits out figures.  (I actually worked hands on at my company with getting a wholly new system set up that could generate these things applying the formula dictated by the gov't, it was a giant PITA).

Basically, all these things are supposed to show you are some very general out of pocket examples that you can use - combined with the cost of coverage - for you to better judge what coverage will cost you.

So if you have a couple/three plan choices and these examples all look fairly close (say $50 or less difference), but the cost of coverage varies - it will lead you to the most cost effective plan.

Another factor that sort of makes these things worthless are employer plans and their offerings.  When employers offer varied plan choices, they tend to be what we call ""actuarially equivalent.""  The plans have varied levels of deductibles and coinsurance amounts, and the cost of the coverage ratchets up or down based on those amounts.  In the end, after all the math, they work out to be basically the same.  The only difference being who and the amount of paying ""first dollar.""

Annnnd all that insurance goblety-gook aside, look at those as a very general summary.  If costs look the same, it's because they pretty much are the same.  In order to narrow your choices down you'll want to look at more detail than is contained in those summaries - stuff like the plan's network (are there doctor/hospitals in network near you, is your current doctor in the network, etc.)."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;It's usually the same cost as if you were to go to a regular ER in the hospital.

Unfortunately, there's not much in the way of charge ""norms"" for emergency care, so....."
HealthInsurance,"No, though you'll almost certainly find people who believe otherwise. 

They may be able to acquire policies off marketplace - try something like [Stride Health](https://www.stridehealth.com/) or eHealthinsurance?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; You're going to have to find your current plan's documentation
 
look for your Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC). [It looks like this](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf). It has the info you need, EXCEPT for your contributions/premiums. Your plan is obliged to provide you your SBC, often via PDF, so you may already have it someplace in your email. If not check your employer's/insurer's website"
HealthInsurance,They might. Hope you have insurance now
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"So I just looked into this and you're right, it's possible. Thank you for your contribution on this. Now I have one more question.. My main goal is to move both parents in with me, which would result in my mom quitting her job and thereby losing their insurance...do you have any idea on what I can do to get him good insurance plan with his condition and the possible costs?"
HealthInsurance,"I'd double check with the insurance company and the providers.  ALL the providers.  The Surgeon, Anesthesiologist, Hospital, etc. to make sure they are ""in-network.""  Check again right before the procedure (things change).  

It's not unheard of for an excellent surgeon to be ""in-network"".  It's just usually more difficult to get on the schedule of someone who's in high demand. I live in an area with several top of the line hospitals and providers and they all take insurance. Good on you for checking before the procedure! So many people don't."
HealthInsurance,Who is your plan with?
HealthInsurance,"I just did a quick Google search and they don't seem to have great reviews... Have you found that they cover anything you need to do or is it just basic ""wellness"" coverage?"
HealthInsurance,"That depends on why it failed, if OP set this up online and typed his information wrong, that's his fault. Some banks reqyire you to notify them of drafts like this or they will block the transaction- that would also he OP's fault. If it had gone through even once and then they had failed to take payment afterward I would agree with you, but the fact that it never went through and OP didn't read the emails that show the past due balance does not help the situation."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; but pure private health insurance costs are like 4k a month!

Where did you determine that figure?"
HealthInsurance,Good to know that. thx
HealthInsurance,"So, companies are responsible (per federal law) to ensure that dependents enrolled in healthcare plans are actually eligible to join. They do this using a documentation audit system. Your dependents are legally able to join the health care plan if eligible, they aren't *entitled* to the healthcare plan without sufficient documentation, however. If you cannot provide satisfactory documentation to establish that the dependent is eligible to join the plan (usually within 30 days), yes they can revoke/terminate insurance coverage. 

It's the birth certificate that stands out as the odd factor here for a dependent spouse application. It's not unheard of to provide birth certificates as part of eligibility documents (generally that's done for children). In any event, the common terms for a spouse include copy of the marriage certificate and documentation establishing the current marital status, including a tax return with both spouses on it, and or bank statement or utility bill with name of both partners sent to the same address, lease agreement, etc. The documentation requirements should be spelled out in the verification packet sent to you by your company. But at the end of the day, you must comply with the verification standards as outlined in the plan contract details. Nothing they're asking for is illegal. Odd to ask for as much as they're asking for, perhaps, but not illegal."
HealthInsurance,I have never heard of a look back period. If your coverage is effective May 1st you are covered for services May 1st going forward. No plan is going to pay for services rendered prior to the effective date.
HealthInsurance,"Because the billed amount is largely irrelevant and is a negotiating tactic for the physicians. What matters is the contract negotiated rate. Say they bill $200, and your contracted rate is $150. You only pay $150. If you're in cost sharing, the sum of your payment and the insurance payment only needs to hit $150. 

On an insurance plan, neither you nor the insurance is ever paying the billed rate. 

Only the contracted negotiated rate will count towards your deductible (and only the part of that which you are responsible for as the patient, so 100% prior to deductible, and X% after your deductible). "
HealthInsurance,"You will qualify for special enrollment. Choosing a private company vs the marketplace would depend on how much coverage you want, how much money you want to spend every month, and if you have any preexisting medical conditions.

For example, the private plans I work with offer health vision, and dental. Markeplace only provides health. However private plans don't offer government assistance that the marketplace can.
"
HealthInsurance,"haven't heard of this, would like to know more

In my experience most insurers have long been pretty stingy about ""tricked out"" durable equipment (special wheelchairs, etc)

Doesn't seem like something insurers would go for unless required by statute/regulation"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"I did read that bridge strategy. From a cash flow perspective I feel fine not enrolling and just paying cash unless something catastrophic occurs. What I couldn’t figure out from the bridge strategy was whether I would suffer any consequences from my insurance lapsing, given my pre-existing conditions. 

I’m new to the community so I am not sure what your “what do I win?” Comment means in regards to my question. Since it’s reddit I’ll assume it’s snark :)"
HealthInsurance,Is the provider in network?
HealthInsurance,"OP, ask your boss or whomever at work for copies of the Summaries of Benefits and Coverage (SBCs) for each of the options you may elect. [SBCs look like this](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf). Each insurer is obliged to provide you one of these ""nutrition labels for health coverage"" for each option you can choose among. SBCs make it somewhat easier to compare plans feature for feature to determine their value to you. The one key ingredient YOU need to keep track of is the premium or contribution cost to you - SBCs do not include that."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; The one key ingredient YOU need to keep track of is the premium or contribution cost to you - SBCs do not include that.

I have those and did notice that they don’t provide amounts for premiums."

HealthInsurance,If hes a resident of california he should see if he qualifies for medicaid
HealthInsurance,What is the mothers income and age?
HealthInsurance,"Sorry but good luck enforcing that since most providers understand the negotiated rate isn’t always what best for the patient and with premiums what they are for awful coverage, I hardly see any consumers calling out there providers to insurance companies. 

Healthcare needs transparency not what we have currently where we find out costs after the fact unless we push and persist."

HealthInsurance,I pay a little over $600 for a PPO plan in my state.  It shouldn’t matter who your employer is if you’re buying it on your own. I would avoid an HMO at all costs.
HealthInsurance,"People are trying to help you and took the time to respond—-don’t be an ungrateful a-hole. What I posted was relevant to your post. Lame, dude. ��"
HealthInsurance,"others have mentioned short term policies. Yes, you can buy them, but their value is...limited, and because they don't satisfy ACA standards, you'd still be on the hook for penalties for lack of coverage.

Maybe try health sharing ministries. They aren't actually health insurance, and so their value for your premium dollar is more limited than they let on - but that sort of ""coverage"" gets you out from under the penalties. Not sure if ACA's enrollment timing rules apply to them"
HealthInsurance,"Insurance companies are regulated by each state (part of why health insurance in the US is as weird as it is...but don't get me started). You'd file complaints - a grievance, or appeal - with your state's Insurance Commissioner (or Supervisor, or whatever that role is called in your state, via the state Department of Insurance (again, or whatever it's called in IL). 


CC'ing your state government representatives on any action you pursue with state regulators lets the regulators know you mean business. Elected representatives may not be good at it, but they really like to be able to use their office to help constituents - constituents and their families &amp; friends vote! Helping people is good for winning votes! (scan any bio of Lyndon Johnson - great stuff on his maniacal efforts to help his Texas constituents)"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Oxford Metro M Bronze EPO HSA $6550 100% Gated OHI CNT 

That's exactly what I needed.  This is a gated plan, which means you need to pick a Primary Care Physician and go through them for referrals (for specialists).  Looks like RX is covered at 100% AFTER the deductible.  Certain generic meds are covered with no deductible.  Here is the benefit summary:

HealthInsurance,"&gt;This implies that I am supposed to bankroll my own medical emergencies in the interim timeframe of ""insurance ended"" to ""new insurance acquired""?

Not sure what you mean here. Take a look at this [walkthru of a COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) - it may clear some things up for you"
HealthInsurance,It's because there is a difference in insurers.  Some are more expensive and cover more expensive doctors.
HealthInsurance,"He told me he paid about $25 per month, but it's possible that he meant $25 per paycheck? We get paid every two weeks.  It wasn't necessarily an amazing plan by any means, but I don't have too much more info about it right now as he's not in for a few more days and this plan isn't available to me because I'm salaried."
HealthInsurance,"Seriously. And I used to think my $300 monthly employee portion was harsh!

I got the 3rd ""cheapest"" plan (of about 30 plans) and it's terrible. I can't decline mental health coverage for no reason that I can comprehend, and I can't decline maternity because if you're female and live in Texas, you have to have it. So I have all this extra coverage that I'll never use, at least not in Texas, and the rest barely covers what I do need."
HealthInsurance,"Your provider (assuming they're in network) will try to get a retroactive approval.  Honestly, if they're in network, it's sloppy on their part not to get the prior authorization."
HealthInsurance,"Np. I think it's the insurers' way of making sure ppl don't just go through a fake separation/divorce just to get insurance because they get diagnosed w/a serious illness, etc."
HealthInsurance,"Depending on the insurance carrier and state, you might lose coverage at the end of the month. CALL your insurance company and ask.  Also ask them for a ""Certificate of prior coverage.""  This is what you need in order to sign up at work.  They might not be able to give it to you until you've been booted off but a little persistence is worth a try."
HealthInsurance,This is great info. Thank you
HealthInsurance,"Both doctors are with the same provider, but the hospital and medical record system seems different. I would like to get the doctor's notes transferred to the new doctor but I would assume that something that is not normally shared?"
HealthInsurance,"So if her open enrollment is in November, and mine is in February, how do we get over to my plan effectively? Is it even possible?

+\u\NearlyNormalJimmy"
HealthInsurance,"You're right that KS did not expand Medicaid, so you won't qualify unless you have a child that does. Does the surgery have to happen before the policy starts? Honestly, even if you moved to a state that did expand Medicaid, those applications usually take between forever and never to process, so from the doctor/ hospital's view you would still be uninsured at the time of service, it just might get sorted out later."
HealthInsurance,"Sometimes providers offer discounts for full pre-payment and uninsured patients.  "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the input.  Ill update yall when it works itself out.  "
HealthInsurance,"I see the original error in interpretation/communication. My intention was to say, be sure the new plan isn't member Rx-responsibility up front, LIKE an HSA qualifying plan, which could net any additional compensation. Fear this is where we've gotten off track. We both obviously understand what an HSA qualifying plan entails and requires no further discussion."
HealthInsurance,"Im in PA, the only reason I really needed it is to avoid a fine on my taxes but it's looking to be cheeper to take the fine then pay private companies. "
HealthInsurance,"If you either just joined your company or your company just had their enrollment period, you had a qualifying life event that allowed you to be dropped or added from more or less any plan. Including hers. I'm not sure where she's getting her info, but it's incorrect. As soon as you qualified for your plan, you qualified to be removed from hers. There's a window, though, so her telling you she can't do anything may have let that window go by. Whatever. Maybe that's one of those situations where it's just best to pick your battles, you know?

As far as the insurances go, it's worth underscoring that you don't get to choose who your primary is. NAIC guidelines say that any plan on which you are the actively working subscriber is primary, so as long as you're not paying the premiums for your mom's part of the plan, hers isn't really going to have any effect on you, negative or positive. Everything should be processing through your plan first. Lab work. Doctor's visits. Prescriptions.

I'm not really sure what this means:

&gt; Or do I just need to pay off my primary deductible to get coverage from my primary ins.?

So if you have more general questions about insurance deductibles work, definitely feel free to ask, but for all intents and purposes your plan is first and, if you want, you can give your mom's insurance information to healthcare providers to bill second. Maybe her plan will pay something, maybe it won't. Depends entirely on how her plan is setup and how it does the math. If you only gave healthcare providers the info for you plan, though, no one would blame you and there wouldn't be any repercussions, so maybe that would be the easier options."
HealthInsurance,"without the statement, your Explanation of Benefits (EOB), and maybe a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC), its kind of hard to know for sure, but if networks are involved &amp; treatment was out of network a fraction of a component of the charge - like the anesthesia you mention -  may have been regarded as ""not covered"". Hard to know for sure without much more specifics, &amp; probably not worth your while to post all the documents"
HealthInsurance,"healthcare.gov is your best bet for a primer. You can use the site's enrollment tools to ""test"" how well the Affordable Care Act satisfies your dad's current situation.

One wildcard factor you haven't mentioned is dad's income. His outlays for coverage may depend on whether he'd qualify for premium subsidies.

Another, longer term question: would dad be thinking about staying in the US beyond his 65th birthday? He could qualify for Medicare coverage during the intervening time. Long term, that would probalby save him a bunch."
HealthInsurance,You don't have to use the exchange (healthcare.gov) unless you want to (and qualify for ) a subsidy.  Everyone is free to shop direct with any carrier.  I would get in touch with a local independent agent.  They will be familiar with all the options available to you.
HealthInsurance,"For the best health plan through my employer I pay. $430 a month to insure myself and my spouse. Its a good plan with a 10% co payment, $1,000 deductible and $6,000 dollar out of pocket max. "
HealthInsurance,If you were in an auto accident then the auto insurance should be covering this
HealthInsurance,"Yes. But not until April.You need to get an ACA marketplace plan and use the new move special enrollment period. The plan will start the first of the next month, so in April you could get surgery if you can wait that long. "
HealthInsurance,What was your previous monthly income?  Is there any reason why you don't want to apply for Medicaid?
HealthInsurance,In that case I'd call and fight with the insurance company to get you covered for that month.  I'm Sorry! That sucks.
HealthInsurance,"Hi! Those are really good plans and great prices.  Your employer must pay the majority of the premiums for the employees.  

You're saving $780 a year by going with the $60 option vs the $125 option.  That $780 basically pays for your $800 deductible on the Coinsurance plan (should you need to pay it).  We always look at it this way, that $800 is a potential savings - and if you give it to the insurance company in the form of premiums, you sure aren't getting that money back.  This way you can *potentially* save $800 and even if you need to satisfy the $800 deductible, it's a wash between plans.

Do carefully look at the plan designs for the RX - note if there are any maximums on the coinsurance plan.  Is it 20% up to a certain amount per RX once you've satisfied the deductible? "
HealthInsurance,"Yea, unfortunately we have looked into that already. But we are trying to see if anyone has experience with any specific programs."
HealthInsurance,"There are private insurance plans that you are able to get onto year round if you qualify. 

What state are you in?"
HealthInsurance,There is no legal consequences if you aren't cheating them.  Pit in your anticipated annual income
HealthInsurance,"She's 22. She doesn't have any income at the moment. When she does work she does freelance set design in film. "
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"You'll probably lose coverage on the day you turn 26. You can contact the health insurance company you are will and advise them you need documents supporting the loss of coverage because you have to sign up for a plan and require proof. They'll be able to provide you with that. Usually insurance companies send you them prior to losing coverage. Check your mail. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! Is that something they could figure out by calling the dentist office?

They got a cap. Does that change anything?"
HealthInsurance,"Agree, will back pay, reading income and whatnot the child will qualify for state Medicaid."
HealthInsurance,Not illegal.  Just against his contract
HealthInsurance,They can give people that go through the Wellness Screening a *discount*. Guess it's all in how you word it.
HealthInsurance,"Sorry, I don't know what a CPT is.

No, I don't believe she gave me anything at all. I literally only went in so I could have the vaccination form. I didn't get vaccinations either. They didn't find anything, refer me anywhere, or any test that's outside a physical.

Yes, it was just a single page of general questions where you checkmark off from one to four (e.g. ""do you feel sad often"") the nurse didn't even discuss it at all.

Thank you for responding!


**edit** 

Sorry, just googled what CPT is. I'm not seeing anything on it that looks like a code on the bill (if it would be there at all), but I'll keep looking. I can only see one side of it though, it says there's important information on the other side yet only gives me access to the front........."
HealthInsurance,"So then this question is easier. Basically, you need to talk to the head b**** in charge of billing. And ask her, what am I doing wrong, and how can I make it right. Invite her out for a fairly expensive brunch, by which I mean on your box. Show her a little respect, and even though it won't be deserved, she will actually do her job.  To be honest, her job and the people in her department is to make sure that you are doing your job right, but billing staff at doctors offices tend to get lazy. Ask for some training. And if you don't get a response, ask again, via email, and blind carbon copy your boss."
HealthInsurance,"Hi! Weirdly enough, I also live in Rensselaer county, and work at a local insurance company. A lot of my medicaid members have issues with the New York State of Help being generally unhelpful. 
I feel like I'm on the border of soliciting, but I'm not giving the name of the company I work for so maybe this is ok? 
So my insurance has a phone line you can call, and they kind of act as the mediator between you and NYSOH. 
I'm sure other companies do to.

So if you like the company your parents have insurance through and want to stick with them, I'd give them a call, let them know you're looking for a managed Medicaid plan, ask if they have a department that can help you enroll through NYSOH. 
Or just call around to various insurance companies, and ask them all.
Generally, NYS medicaid benefits are basically the same no matter who you choose. The main difference will be the network. So if you currently see specialists, or even just really like your primary doctor, make sure to check with the prospective insurance company to make sure they are in your network."
HealthInsurance,"I have never done any research on the internet about it, but as far as I’m aware, the impact is to the provider and not the patient. So in this case, should the insurance company find out and decide to take steps for it, the provider would see a decrease in payment until they likely reached a settlement. But again, that’s if the insurance company finds out and decides to take steps. "
HealthInsurance,"This is correct, insurance will cover your ER visit without issues of consumption, additionally, they cannot tell your parents anything outside of the treatment received at the hospital. The only thing insurance will tell your parents is what they covered in the explanation of benefits, such as x-rays, cast, physician/hospital costs. The Hospital might bill a little depending on what insurance doesn't cover, that depends on plan/deductable. But your good, insurance covers and your parents never have to know."
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Yes, I am familiar with the filing requirements. My point is that for the duration of my stay in the USA, my online gambling income will be zero, because I will be unable to access gambling sites domestically. This obviously will take a significant toll on projected 2018 earned income, which I thought the insurance market takes into account when determining eligibility for applications filed by self-employed individuals."
HealthInsurance,"jump on the internets (oh hey look, you're already on), go to something like [HealthSherpa](https://www.healthsherpa.com) (it's free, no need to register before shopping, maybe a bit simpler to navigate than healthcare.gov for shopping), enter your specifics as prompted, &amp; see what's available. 

My hunch is you'll be putting away a BUNCH of that $1,400 (your employer is, frankly, nuts - but in a good way for you ;- ) )


Oh, and unless you need pricey work &amp; can wait 6 months/year to do it, forget dental insurance &amp; use your surplus employer cash to pay for cleanings/fillings. "
HealthInsurance,"all health coverage is ""local"" - your options, and their costs to you, depend a lot on your individual circumstances.

in your case you've supplied almost all of the pertinent ""local"" details, except, as others have pointed out, your contributions for each of the options you have shared here. with contribution amounts you can fill in [a simple matrix comparing your total cost of coverage for each option](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif). But while you're at it, supply a city &amp; state &amp; we can probably confirm whether other options might be an even better fit for you."
HealthInsurance,"If you enter your income as at least $12,100 (The Federal Poverty Level) you'll qualify for a premium subsidy and cost-sharing reductions (If you choose a silver plan) - The deductible shouldn't be more than a few hundred dollars.  



It would depend on the individual clinic or hospital - But many financial assistance discounts are applied to the patient's portion (i.e. Insurance pays $4500 - Patient owes $500 - If a financial assistance discount of 80% is given them the patient owes $100) - But you would have to check with the clinic or hospital to be sure."
HealthInsurance,Part that complicates this is that I went May June without insurance as I had a qualifying event from turning 26 and being kicked off my parents insurance.  So when I file it's thinking I went 3 months without insurance
HealthInsurance,"I'm not disagreeing, but this doctor seems to be making a real effort."

Thanks for replying!

I don't have insurance with my company currently. I have it through my parents. 

A courthouse wedding seems like the easiest. 

Are there any other viable options?"
HealthInsurance,Yes please!
HealthInsurance,"I'm logged into BCBS now and that's where I'm getting the information from. The BCBS account I've logged into is where it say $4737.28 in Billed Amount. To the left of those amounts they all say ""Processed""."
HealthInsurance,"From what I understand, the HSA plan does not include any contribution from my employer. That said, it's also the only plan where I can use an HSA (the other ones I can only use an FSA)."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for the advice. I'm not terribly concerned about being ACA compliant right now...rather, my focus is on not dying...

I'll look into the community health center. As for being a pre-existing condition, how do insurance companies determine whether you had a condition before or after coverage begins?"
HealthInsurance,"So, bit late to the party, but..

Here ls my advice:

Collect all your bank statements of your payments. Did you pay each and every month? Mark the months you didn’t pay and keep notes.

Next contact bank and find out who those payments went to. They went to insurance company? Great! Get something the insurance company can verify, transaction numbers, amounts and dates.

Add this to your notes.

Still with me?

Awesomeness!

Next call insurance company you had coverage with. Be firm yet polite. They are human just like you.  That should get you ether a refund or a document stating you had coverage.

If they have no clue what your talking about, try to find out where you had coverage if any. 

The people on the phone at healthcare.gov and state based websites, literally read a screen. Hence why you get 10 different answers from 5 people. The jargon they use is technically and the agents have to fill in the gaps.  Most have never even dealt with insurance or navigated the waters so to speak. 

Anyhow, next step , do they show any form of enrollment? Write it down. Dates, times, names or coverage/plan, etc
 

That should give you an excellent starting point.


Once you kinda know where you stand, you might qualify for  an exemption. There are lots of them, and you might be eligible for one to help out with the tax fee."
HealthInsurance,When did you lose coverage?
HealthInsurance,I'm not worried about that I am worried they will F with the estate ie force a probate. I just settled stuff with a small estate affidavit. I don't want to have to deal with a probate and such. Over $115k they are going to use whatever legal avenues they have to get that money and I don't want it to come to that. Her taxable portfolio was $75k and I used a SEA to claim it and am going to use it to pay her only debt at the moment which is the mortgage.
HealthInsurance,"Letter(s) as follows...
Letter 1: (UC Health) Amount due: $154
Letter 2: (EOB from Blue Cross) Amount due: $113.36
Letter 3: (EOB from Blue Cross) Amount due: $139.10
Letter 4: (Mercy Health) Amount due: $113.36
Letter 5: (The Jewish Hospital) Amount due: $694.80

So the last letter does not look like an EOB. Letter 1&amp;2 have that on the top.

Here is letter 5: https://imgur.com/a/TucYg

HealthInsurance,"You mention starting these in January. I'm not familiar with Florida Blue, though I could ask a colleague, but it's possible you were able to take advantage of a grace fill for the first 1-2 and then your cost share increased due to not meeting a requirement. First hunch."
HealthInsurance,"Have you looked at the Explanation of Benefits from your insurer?  "
HealthInsurance,What's your income?  Some hospital's are very willing to reduce charges for people with lower incomes.  Most will also offer no interest payment plans.
HealthInsurance,"It is really unusual for a 15 year old to be on Medicare. If you don't mind me asking, what qualified him?"
HealthInsurance,"Many if not most employers adopted what's called ""non-duplication"" Coordination Of Benefits rules years &amp; years ago. Oversimplifying that means dual coverage is almost never an economically rational arranagement for you."
HealthInsurance,Private insurance! There are some plans that offer preferred rates based on health.
HealthInsurance,"Depending on where you live, the plan I have might not be available to you and the price might be different because its based on the individual. But the coverage is great, in my opinion."
HealthInsurance,"Yes. Let's imagine a clean slate: assume you don't have any claims so far this year, so nothing has gone to your deductible or out of pocket yet.  Assume also that the surgery costs $10,000 (for the sake of illustration).

The costs would break down like this:

10000 - **2700** (deductible) = 7300

7300 * 10% (coinsurance) = **730**    
2700 + 730 = **3430** (This is your responsibility.)

7300 * 90% = *6750* (This is what your insurance pays.)


In the case that you stated, you have $369.40 remaining on your deductible.  Assuming the same $10k for the procedure above, it would break down like this:

10000 - 369.40 (remaining deductible) = 9630.60

9630.60 * 10% (coinsurance) = 963.06  
963.06 + 369.4 = **1332.46** (Your total responsibility for the surgery)

9630.60 * 90% = *8667.54* (What insurance pays)"
HealthInsurance,"If it's the same tooth then there might be something wrong with the root canal.  Some dentists include all required follow up in the price of the original root canal.  So check with their dentist first.

HealthInsurance,Amazing! How did you find out it would be covered?
HealthInsurance,"Generally comes down to if the hospitals are related and or use the same type of electronic medical records system. These days they can usually also import your medications from the pharmacy as well, or at minimum, definitely any controlled medications. "
HealthInsurance,"Alternative is no insurance  and pray for no major health issues.

For 2018 the penalty for not having health insurance  is $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater.

And of course you'll have to cover your own medical expenses out of pocket."
HealthInsurance,"You can apply through the marketplace and possibly get a subsidy.  Your income has to be at least 100% of the federal poverty level to qualify (Texas did not expand their Medicaid program).  UNT also offers a student health insurance policy that is about $2700 a year currently.

HealthInsurance,"Thanks very much for your reply. I'm also hoping for a positive outcome for reinstatement, but much of what I've read says once cancelled, it is final in many cases. I'm hoping since I am working directly with the insurance company, not the marketplace - there may be a chance. 



If reinstatement is not possible, there's still 9 months to go in the year; so now I am considering asset protection in the event of an emergency. Are you aware of any alternatives for insurance outside of the options which have a defined enrollment period? Is there anything I can do to get coverage for catastrophic insurance for the remainder of the year? "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I'm not an American so I am unsure of how I can find this information.     

I would begin by googling ""historic costs health insurance USA.""  
The results are right there."
HealthInsurance,"BCBS Federal tends to be a really great plan for therapy (source: I do the billing for a therapy office)! They'll need to put a diagnosis code on the claim (which is totally private, just between them and the insurance company), but therapists are generally pretty good at picking a code. Even if you don't qualify to be diagnosed with a mental illness, there are codes like Z codes which can be something along the lines of ""problem with spouse"" or ""parent child relational problem"" (which any person can have, and I'm totally paraphrasing btw). As always, ask if there's any diagnosis your plan won't cover; we mostly treat eating disorders and some plans don't cover binge eating for example, and I've also seen plans where we're not permitted to use a Z code, but if you explain in general to the rep on the phone why you're going in they should know what exceptions to tell you. Finally, if you go in and for whatever reason they won't cover your visit, find out why and you can ask the therapist to make necessary edits. Good luck!"

HealthInsurance,"As a medical biller for 20+ years, I can tell you a hard, cold fact: if it isn’t collected up front, 80-90% of patient balances are never paid. Doctors and hospitals are realizing this, and collecting up front. They are happy to do refunds if overpaid. "
HealthInsurance,"Hi! It depends on which carrier you have.  Your physician should be able to appeal it for you.  They are probably initially denying it because Adderall is supposed to be prescribed for ADHD.  Your prescribing physician can best explain to the insurance carrier why he/she feels you need it for an ""off label"" use.  No guarantees it will be covered, but they should be able to appeal it for you."
HealthInsurance,"I believe you have to go through a section 125 cafeteria plan through your employer to use pre-tax dollars towards any health care expenses. "

HealthInsurance,"When clinics/doctors enter contracts with health insurers part of that contract will dictate what they (the health insurance company) will pay for X, Y, Z  services. So, this clinic may bill $100 if you dont have insurance, but their contract with your current insurance likely states that they have to accept their rate of $45 as payment in full. Its a perk of having insurance, you are almost always going to have a discounted rate over someone who isnt insured."
HealthInsurance,"Next to the billed amount should be a second value showing the contracted rate. What does that say?

My EOB summary says billed amount, discount, covered amount, what your plan paid, what I owe. 

For example, my psychiatrist bills $300 for an hour. 
My EOB reads: $200, $50, $150, $0, $150. 

Only the $150 counts to the deductible.  "
HealthInsurance,"by ""do it"", do you mean ""acquire ACA qualifying coverage""?

HealthInsurance,"Enroll in a Medicare Part D program. Part D is standalone prescription drug coverage and you don't need Part B to get it. Also losing COBRA is usually an SEP for Part D. Go to [Medicare.gov](http://medicare.gov) and use the compare drug plans tool to see if anyone covers your medication. 

I have a feeling this is going to be a medication not on the formularies for most companies as it's typically covered by Part B, but this is a quick search that may hold some answers.

Enroll in Medicare Part B. Currently we're at the tail end of the general  enrollment period, enroll before March 31 and Part B will begin July 1st. I realize that's only a month of outpatient medical coverage over 3 months from now, but it's something...

In the meantime the advice about the manufacturer is a good start. 

I'm sorry you've found yourself in this mess. I hope waiving Part B in favor of COBRA when you did wasn't at the advice of a broker as you see now it was a dangerously bad idea. It's a terrible flaw in the system that organizations have been lobbying to be changed for years."

HealthInsurance,"Freestanding Emergency Departments that are open 24/7 are typically the same price as hospital ED's. There are free-standing ED's that aren't open 24/7, which usually have lower rates because they don't need to pay staff to be there 24/7.  Recently, some insurance companies have started denying claims for non-emergency conditons when you go to any Emergency Department. The increase in non-emergent patients (and the associated denials) have lead some ED's to institute up-front co-pays for patients presenting to the ED for non-emergent conditions. With both, their physicians (including radiologist/pathologists) may also be out of network for your insurance, making those bills higher. 

Lastly, a main reason that Emergency Care is so expensive is because of people mis-using and abusing Emergency Care sevices.  Whether attached to a hospital or free-standing, Emergency Department's are intended for emergent situations.  

Most insurance companies have a nurse hotline you can call if you're unsure if you're situation is urgent/emergent. Some plans also include telemedicine benefits.

HealthInsurance,What state do you live in?  What's your income?
HealthInsurance,"$1400 is a lot. Well over what plans in your area likely cost for a single 28 year old, even adding dental. But I see a different problem here, have you had health insurance from somewhere else this year? 

It's great that they offer that much, but you're now purchasing as an individual and you have to play by those rules. There's an annual enrollment window from 11/1 to 12/15. Outside of that you need a special enrollment period(SEP), which can be triggered in lots of circumstances, but that list narrows if you don't currently have health coverage or a plan that ended in the last 60 days.

Without an SEP your options are definitely limited."
HealthInsurance,"I would just wait it out. At this point, if the insurance denies the authorization then it is likely the provider will appeal. So hang tight."

HealthInsurance,"&gt;Is it legal

sure. You can get a flu shot wherever you want. If you want your insurer to pay some/all of its price, under your policy, you go to clinicians whose services they'll pay for."
HealthInsurance,"I'd call your insurance to clarify. It could be that you were billed as a routine eye exam and contact lens fitting. 
The weird thing about some vision insurance is they will cover a routine glasses exam, or a contact lens exam, but not both. So a routine eye exam may cover at $0 copay, but the fitting itself is an extra copay charge depending on your prescription or if they count these services as separate from the glasses exam. Also, Toric lens may cause the copay to increase depending on the bill, or the cost of the lens itself. "
HealthInsurance,"Did they list the facility itself as in network?  Not just the physician? If so,  then it may be an error.  
 Try contacting the facility and advise them that you're receiving a denial notice from your insurance. They may attempt to appeal this with your plan to process correctly. "

HealthInsurance,"The employer doesn’t have a family option?

Regardless, it may be a qualifying event if you are eligible or are receiving a subsidy, because that will likely change. Call healthcare.gov and they may allow the plan change request. The insurance company directly will not. "

HealthInsurance,"Nope they don't cover any of my expenses.  Right now I'm living on savings.  I'm not sure if I can count that as income? "

HealthInsurance,"Talk to your university.

Some have free counseling for students, full stop. Some have up to five sessions/semester covered. Your university will almost certainly have seen students in your situation before and will probably be able to help. Because of HIPAA and FERPA, they won't be able to tell your parents.

It's a practical solution, rather than an insurance-focused one, but I've been in your shoes fairly recently. Once that EOB goes out in the mail, the company can't control who opens it. Your university will limit the flow of information and may not bill your insurance at all. (My first uni didn't, and I never bothered with either my college nor my second uni in that regard, so I don't know for sure.)

Your college's office for students with disabilities can probably point you in the right direction. Your RA probably could, as well. It sucks and it's scary, getting help, but I'm rooting for you."
HealthInsurance,"Since no one commented I thought I’d give my two-cents. If you use your parents’ insurance they can and will see the doctors you use. Your doctor can not tell them what you’re being seen for, but since they’re paying for your insurance they will know where the moneys going. You can see what resources your school has. They usually have a lot for students and you should be able to use your school insurance instead of your parents."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks a lot for helping me to figure out all this! 
But it's still not very clear to me. On IRS website it says:
While you can claim most exemptions from coverage when you file your tax return, certain exemptions must be granted by the Health Insurance Marketplace in advance. This includes coverage exemptions for certain hardship situations and for members of certain religious sects. 

And for affordability exemption it says this:
May only be claimed on tax return

Does it mean that if I claim this exemption do I still need ECN number for that? Why turbotax allows to proceed without ECN?

"
HealthInsurance,"Anytime!

Yes, the affordability exemption has to be claimed on the actual tax return as its income based. basically they look at your income, and coverage in your area, and see if it was affordable. If it wasn't they would grant an ECN for you to file with.  If it was affordable and you didnt have any coverage, your get hit with fee.

( and by affordable, they dont look at ""hey they have to pay for food, utilities,etc"" they look at household income, and say hey you made this much, and your cost for health coverage is this much. its under the 9.69% amount so its affordable by our standards)

Other exemptions, you dont need immediate proof,  hardship is good example, flood, natural disaster, etc (there is a list of the hardship exemptions on marketplace)  They know some things are outside your control. With a hardship, there is not alot one can do to avoid it. You would just take next step and apply for the exemption at a later date with proof.


As for affordability, its 9.69% for job based coverage.

&gt; A job-based health plan covering only the employee that costs 9.69% or less of the employee’s household income. If a job-based plan is “affordable,” and meets the “minimum value” standard, you're not eligible for a premium tax credit if you buy a Marketplace insurance plan instead.



In previous posts you stated your household made $91,000 average a year. (rough estimates follow, and I stalked your post history to pull numbers, sorry if I offended you, let me know and i will throw in random numbers)

&gt; $91,000 divided by 12 months a year = $7583

&gt; 9.69% of the monthly household income = $734.79

&gt; Monthly cost to the employee of the lowest-priced plan the employer offers for self-only coverage = $800

&gt; Is the plan affordable? NO.
&gt; The employee’s share of the lowest-cost self-only plan ($800) is more than 9.69% of the employee’s household income ($734)

So if you were offered job based coverage for that amount, then you could get an exemption from the fee.

Have your HR Dept, or whoever handles the insurance, fill out this form:
[To find out if your employer’s plan meets the affordability standard, ask your employer. You can also ask them to fill out the Employer Coverage Tool (PDF).](https://marketplace.cms.gov/applications-and-forms/employer-coverage-tool.pdf)



As for your tax software, right from their site: ( seems they fill out the paperwork for you)


 Q. 	Are there any exemptions or exceptions to the penalty?
A. 	Yes, and we've got it covered. If you didn't have health insurance in 2017, we'll make sure to check if you had any situations that qualify to get the penalty waived. That way, you can be confident your taxes are done right and you get the exemptions you qualify for.

Q. 	I couldn't afford health insurance in 2017. Do I still have to pay the penalty?
A. 	Depending on your income and how much coverage would have cost, you could qualify to get the penalty waived. When you do your taxes, we'll ask about whether there were any affordable health insurance options available to you in 2017 and waive the penalty if there were not.

HealthInsurance,"Hello, so open enrollment has already passed. You may qualify for a special enrollment period if you have had any one of [these](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/special-enrollment-period/) life changes.

A person can apply for Medicaid at any time, but regrettably, Georgia has not expanded medicaid. Eligibility criteria are [here](https://dch.georgia.gov/applying-medicaid). Unless any of these apply to you, you are not eligible to enroll in health insurance, until the next enrollment period, which will be in December."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the reply!!  
So i do have my own insurance.  
I guess my questions were how it applies to my new insurance, and how to get certain things without my parents knowing"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;basically they look at your income, and coverage in your area, and see if it was affordable. If it wasn't they would grant an ECN for you to file with. If it was affordable and you didnt have any coverage, your get hit with fee.

Sorry, by ""they"" do you mean IRS or healthcare.gov? 

I and my wife work as freelancers, so I'm applying for 8.16% exemption based on marketplace cost.  "
HealthInsurance,"sorry, by they, I mean the IRS. 
Healthcare.gov looks at it, but only to see if it was affordable when filling out said application.

Hopefully you can get that exemption! "
HealthInsurance,Thanks!
HealthInsurance,"Ohhhhh, I completely misunderstood. My apologies. So you do have insurance. What exactly are you looking to find out?"
HealthInsurance,"Medicaid eligibility is based on monthly income and takes precedence over the Marketplace- so if they qualify for Medicaid now (which it sounds like they do) that’s what they need to do. Just update dhhs when your husband starts work. Most states also can pay back medical bills in Medicaid - if that’s the case (called retroactive eligibility) - so for such a short gap you might be able to just wait and submit the forms if needed. 

When your husband gets a job your son can be on the Marketplace but generally won’t qualify for subsidies due to something called the family glitch. You all will have to pay full price as long as he’s considered your dependent, or he could get insurance through his school if it offers coverage. "
HealthInsurance,"This sounds stupid I know, but I need to get birth control without them knowing "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you, this is extremely helpful!"
HealthInsurance,"You can do that. You are an adult. They cannot call and ask any health related questions, or what medications you are taking. That's all PHI protected by HIPAA. Even if you were on your parents plan still, they cannot access your health information legally without your permission. 

And furthermore, if you're 29 years old, it should be none of their business if you're on birth control. I'm guessing they're religious or something. That's a whole other issue.
"
HealthInsurance,"What the poster below said, but also.  What you need to do is call the insurance company, and have the paperwork for your account mail to a different address. If you live with them, I suggest getting a post office box. And having all your health related information sent there. Birth control is provided at no cost through your insurance company. Just make sure that the paperwork go somewhere else. Just because your name is on it doesn't mean that they might not open it."
HealthInsurance,"The first is 20% coinsurance. And the second is a fixed copay. "
HealthInsurance,"Knowing what things cost, I'd go with the coinsurance plan."
HealthInsurance,"I'm coming at this from a healthcare claim validation perspective. The provider either didn't send the code in the right place, or didn't send the correct code. I do not see how you could resolve either of these unless you can submit the claim yourself? 

A diagnosis code is a required field to process electronic claims. I believe it is field 21, position A. I am less familiar with paper claims so I hope I have these form fields right. A claim will kick out before it even gets to the adjudication step if the field/box 21, pos A is not populated. You can have more diagnosis codes, but that first one is considered ""primary"".

There is also form/box 24, diagnosis code pointer. That is a numeric value which points to which diagnosis code goes with this service. It is also a required field, the first one designates primary diagnosis for this service. There can be up to four diagnosis code pointers, but there has to be at least one per service.

So that's one option, the provider didn't populate the form fields. 

The other is as waspycreole said. They put the codes on the form, but they used the wrong code list. Code lists are copyright protected so it'll be mighty difficult for you to guess which code the payer wants.  "
HealthInsurance,"OP, you'll get better guidance if you can provide a more precise ""schedule of your relocations. If, for example, the span is only 2 months, you might find this [COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) is useful for you. If it's much longer - or if your stay in Utah will commence many weeks from now - you may devise a different plan.

If your passage to Colorado is transitory, your principal coverage needs will mostly be for unexpected emergencies -which ""out-of-service area emergency"" provisions in an ACA plan sold in any state where you enroll in it should fairly adequately address."
HealthInsurance,"This is super convoluted.
I just spent 45 minutes on a call with marketplace representative and he told me that I can only apply for an exemption for the current year but not 2017. So there's no way of getting ECN number for me."
HealthInsurance,"sorry to hear of the situation you &amp; your family member are facing. 


There may not be one best response, but two things seem like they might help:

1) scan information in your loved one's Wellcare insurance policy for their claims appeals process - they will have some guidance on who to contact and the process to follow.

2) contact your state's department of insurance and department of health to file complaints.

Depending where you are, you may also benefit by contacting your state government representative(s) - an assemblyperson, or your state senator. Insurance is regulated at the state level - even programs for the elderly and/or infirm that are funded with federal dough - so state-level representatives can be helpful allies in your cause.

With all that, you should still be prepared for frustrating delays &amp; slow-grinding bureaucracy..... Your biggest challenge is persuading a bunch of people with no ""special"" stake in helping you to move *your* family member's case up on their priorities list. Be polite - but be persistent...."
HealthInsurance,"Deductibles for both plans are at a level that tells me you're paying for most of your therapy for the year, unless you're getting a LOT of physical therapy. 

I'm not sure you can make a choice on the economics of either plan for you. Have you confirmed your favorite clinicians are covered by both plans?  Just because they're both Blues plans doesn't guarantee this.

tl;dr my feeling is it's kind of a coin-flip for you, based on what you've told us"
HealthInsurance,"Yea, they have a set verbiage they follow. I would apply anyway thro the site and see what happens. Worst case they say no."
HealthInsurance,"HIPAA officer at a hospital here. Yep, instantly fired."
HealthInsurance,I understand that I am getting a penalty. What I am trying to do is sign up for the cheapest insurance I can to avoid that from happening next year.
HealthInsurance,"What I'm telling you is that you're too late to avoid getting a penalty next year, unless you have a qualifying life event that lets you sign up for insurance, like getting married or moving. You could also still gain insurance through an employer."
HealthInsurance,"My understanding of in-network insurance contracts is that they require the provider to submit the claim, and the provider cannot collect more than the applicable copays/deductibles from you at the time of service (or any other time, for that matter). Most insurance contracts also forbid balance billing as well, which means that they cannot charge you for the amount that your insurance doesn't pay (unless it's your copay or deductible, of course). I would file a complaint with your insurance immediately, this therapist is clearly breaking multiple rules."
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Just a thought given that you said your insurance was 'listed' on the therapist's website. Did you verify the network contract when you spoke to your insurance? Insurance companies have thousands of different plans and providers aren't necessarily in all plans. In addition (unfortunately) any provider can 'take' your insurance which misleads people to think that the provider is in network. However, they can take all PPO plans that offer any out of network benefits. If they aren't in network by contract they are not obligated to file claims to your insurance. Hope it all gets worked out for you!"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah I know I'll most likely be paying a 1 month penalty if I get insured by the end of this month. I believe it's $62.50 per month based on what another redditor wrote. "
HealthInsurance,"Sorry, I guess I am not being clear. You are too late to sign up for ACA-compliant insurance for 2018. The deadline was December 31 in Rhode Island. It was December 15th most other places. You can't just sign up whenever. Open enrollment for 2019 begins on November 1."
HealthInsurance,"""high risk"" isn't a thing anymore. Preexisting conditions aren't considered by ACA compliant plans. But knowing you're going to be using your insurance more than average, you should be on the lookout for a lower deductible plan with good prescription coverage."
HealthInsurance,"It really depends on what that specific plan offers for coverage of specialty drugs like Embrel, and how willing you are to duke it out witb your Pharmacy benefit manager.   Enbrel is not easy to get covered, even with a ""good"" plan.


But knee jerk, it's hard to imagine how a lower premium and some savings in a HSA could possibly offset the cost of Embrel even if the CDHP pys anything.  You re possibly looking at approx $1200 for each 50mg pen (5k a box).  If you're anticipating out of this stratosphere costs, a CDHP makes more sense because you'll reach your deductible quickly so the lower monthly premiums will matter, but you'd still have to be insulated from your co insurance for things like enbrel."
HealthInsurance,"It's going to depend on the plan benefits.  You need to do the following in order:

1.  Get a copy of the drug formulary; make sure that enbrel is on the formularly.  If it isn't, you'll have to get a exception from the insurer (that's a whole nother kettle of fish).

2.  Look at the summary of benefits and coverage; compare both plans, and see what you'll have to pay under both plans.  You might want to post a redacted copy of the summary of benefits and coverage for both plans here."
HealthInsurance,I love this....
HealthInsurance,"If you have lots of medical costs, especially if they are recurring (like specialists and meds every month) buy a more expensive plan that had a lower deductible and covers more stuff.  A bigger network can be an issue too, if you need anything unusual.

If you're healthy, the cheaper plans will not cover much of your day to day (a check up, strep throat, well woman, etc...), so things will mostly be the same as they've been in the past, but if something horrible happens, you'll be covered (after you pay that large deductible).  So that extra money you pay every month is just insurance, and not much else.  It's protecting you from HUGE bills.  Take the money you aren't paying for more comprehensive coverage, and invest in your self and your health and your long term wellness.  Better food, a gym membership, smoking cessation, a better mattrrss, whatever gaps you can identify in your own current health.  Staying healthy is the absolute best investment you can make."
HealthInsurance,Why can't you stay under your parent's insurance?
HealthInsurance,"Second this.  You can stay on until your 26th birthday. "
HealthInsurance,My mom was too poor to afford her insurance plan and my birthday is Monday. Sorry forgot to mention that.
HealthInsurance,"In that case, have you looked into a Marketplace plan?

In all honesty, you likely won't get a subsidy. $250 a paycheck isn't exactly the worst I have seen (depending on the plan), but you may be able to find something cheaper on there."
HealthInsurance,"I've been Googling around and the cheapest I saw was from United Health Care but they said I'll still receive a penalty at the end of the year on my taxes because they were short term.

Also, it's $250 a month, not $250 a paycheck. It's $125 a paycheck but that's still $250 a month that I will mostly like only use once this year... I'd rather pay nothing every month and pay the $100-$200 doctors visit and the $50 prescriptions.

It makes no sense to me."
HealthInsurance,"Side note: regardless if it's on formulary or not, it will always require a prior auth and the auth criteria tend to be very strict for Enbrel.  A prior history of taking it with good results, won't be enough.  "
HealthInsurance,"Googling isn't the same as actually going on the Marketplace. The plans on the Marketplace aren't short term policies.

The reason the individual mandate exists is because to reduce the uninsured pool (this is a good thing) and to make sure people with pre-existing conditions can get policies (also good), everyone was going to be required to opt in or pay a penalty.

A substantial amount of healthcare costs come from a very small amount of people. However, them not having access to care raises the cost for everyone (hospitals can't recoup costs, etc.)

The Marketplace is something created by the federal government (or in some cases, the state) to get policies that would meet the standards of the individual mandate."
HealthInsurance,"Every policy that I saw in the Marketplace was a short-term policy that gave me the exact same message, ""This policy is not covered under the mandate Affordable Care Act"".

We must be going to different websites."
HealthInsurance,$250 a month? Welcome to the real world. I pay $650 a month for my health insurance for just myself.
HealthInsurance,"what in the fuck why

seriously I'm 95% sure I'm only going to go once this year..."
HealthInsurance,"The problem with health insurance is that you think you won’t use it or need until you do. You just never know. "
HealthInsurance,"I'm not saying I don't want any, I just don't this expensive crap"
HealthInsurance,"Yes, this is normal. Any member besides the primary member is a dependent. "
HealthInsurance,Thank you!
HealthInsurance,"No.  One, the insurer wont allow it. Also, the HSA would be issued as two seperate accounts, under two different ssn numbers. 

Sorry."
HealthInsurance,"Ok.....so, what plan specifically ? UHC is a real company...

Is this a short term plan?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Can you enroll an eligible dependent without their consent as well?

Yes.

Private/individual insurance is going to be secondary to employer sponsored coverage.  The private insurance will ask about other coverage and you're obligated to inform them.  Lying about it constitutues fraud.  Any claims sent to the private coverage first (while the other coverage is still in force) will be denied and not paid until they have been sent to the primary."
HealthInsurance,"This is absolutely true. Anesthesiologists are often non-par with the network. They can balance bill after insurance pays. Your out of network is usually the same benefit percentage for anesthesiologists for this reason (might be an Obamacare requirement, don’t remember exactly). However the way they calculate what insurance pays you is based on Medicare or “usual and customary”.  So if in network is 90%, you’re responsible for 10% of the in network negotiated rate. Out of network would be 10% of usual and customary, but they may BILL whatever they want (ie a much higher amount). Also the out of network deductible may be a completely separate bucket. 

Basically, you need to call your insurance company ask ask about all this stuff. Keep in mind that insurance companies make mistakes all the time so a bit of time on the phone and asking the right questions can save you $$$. 

Source: I work for a health insurance company. "
HealthInsurance,"Typically mail order is cheaper for everyone involved. However, there has been a lot of focus on specific drugs - so they may be shifting around what drugs qualify as maintenance drugs. For example, all insurance companies are tightening up on opioids. "
HealthInsurance,"You have three leveled of appeals. The last one goes to an independent third-party. Don’t be afraid to push all the way to the third level. 

Aside from your insurance company, you can also as your employer HR representative. They usually have escalated contacts  at the insurance company that can help make shit happen. "
HealthInsurance,"My insurance is through my husband (and he works for state government), do you think I can still go the hr route?"
HealthInsurance,"This guy is correct. The “embedded” verbiage means that any individual in your family only have to meet the individual ded and moop. So not as bad as you thought! "
HealthInsurance,"Your husband would have to do the asking/complaining. But yea that is still a viable approach. Once HR is involved, they will reach out to their Account Management people at the insurance company and those people will look into it much deeper than a CSR would. HR could also help with the appeal process (likely by asking the account management people) so bring up both issues. “The squeaky wheel gets the grease”.  "
HealthInsurance,Thanks!!
HealthInsurance,No problem. Good luck! Health issues are the worst...
HealthInsurance,"Unfortunately, there is a small possibility that your new insurance simply does not cover your old brand drug. They should have a chemically equivalent generic, which you indicated does not work for you, but they should also have a different brand name drug in its place which they are hoping you switched over to. There are lots of contracts and things with prescription manufactures so they may be contracted with a different manufacturer of a similar drug and cut out the old one entirely. 

You should definitely go through all of the suggestions above - appeals, complain to HR, etc. But I just wanted to mention there is a possibility that you’ll need to switch. "
HealthInsurance,"You mentioned this is a “special case” because the service is not covered by the primary insurance. Unfortunately this is not true. Carrying multiple insurance plans causes a lot of issues and confusion. It is standard that you send everything to primary first before secondary, because UHC doesn’t want to pay a penny that they are not legally liable for. They have No idea what Kaiser does and doesn’t cover, or what percentages, etc. The only way for them to know what they should pay is by sending to Kaiser first. 

That said, reach out to your HR rep. They should be able to get in touch with escalated contacts at the insurance company who may be able to straighten it out for you.  Ask them about the appeal process too - just in case there is a filing time limit for that as well you want to get the ball rolling. 

Good luck. "
HealthInsurance,"I just wanted to second your opinion. The only option would be to move to the other state to reap the benefits of its more liberal coverage requirements. 

You could ask your employer if there is a way to move plans (switch to a corporate job but work in your current office, etc) but that is unlikely. Especially a self-funded plan where the employer is paying for the added cost out of their own bank account. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks so much for this wonderfully informative answer. I'm from the Republic of Ireland. I have a rare eye condition and although I have visited specialists both here and in the UK, I'm much more confident with the specialist in the US-who is an expert in the field.

Would the there be any tricks of the trade applicable for Ireland as well."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. I didn't mean to say it's a ""special case"" in that we shouldn't have to follow the correct procedure. I now totally understand why that process is the way it is and we are making our doctor's office do it correctly from here on out. All I meant was that I am hoping that since it can be easily proven that Kaiser wouldn't pay for anything no matter what we may have a shot if we can talk with the right people, get the right documents, and hope UHC shows us mercy.

I am working to find the correct person to talk to. So far the typical representatives from UHC that I can get to on the phone are telling me this will be ""so easy"", ""no big deal"", etc., but if the professionals at our doctor's office can't even untangle this web then I am scared I won't fare any better.

The UHC ""explanation of benefit"" documents note a 180-day limit for appeals (we are coming up on about 90 now). My main time-related concern is the fact that UHC didn't notify anyone about this until well after the 90-day limit for the dates of service had passed. This means that once our doctor's office finally submitted the claims to Kaiser for denial, Kaiser obviously says they won't pay but their reason code is due to ""timely filing"" rather than ""not covered"". I could see UHC taking issue with this as the reason. 

Now that we know the rules and are following the procedure, we are getting denials from Kaiser saying ""not covered"", which seems like they should be easy to send back to UHC, but the big bucks are in the backlog that was re-evaluated and retroactively denied.

You are absolutely right that carrying multiple insurances causes huge headaches for everyone. In hindsight we would have gladly paid the minor extra for the cash price just to avoid this unbelievable stress and possible huge financial troubles for us... in addition to not being able to start our family.

Thank you for the reply."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Typically mail order is cheaper for everyone involved.

It has been, certainly a decade or more ago; less &amp; less so, particularly for Medicare Advantage/Part D enrollees"
HealthInsurance,"Unless the provider was out of network, in which case they're aren't going to ""fix"" anything :/"
HealthInsurance,"Some insurance companies recognize that you don't have a choice in some of these positions so they'll automatically treat some out of network providers as in network anyways. If you still get a bill for more than what the EOB says, call the insurance. Sometimes they can adjust it."
HealthInsurance,"Though it probably won't bear too much fruit, it might also be worth reaching out to someone in HR. Your work chose the formulary by which your plan abides so the buck stops with them."
HealthInsurance,"The messed up part is that Wageworks isn't able to call out to Cigna because your employer didn't pay Wageworks to. Wageworks can. They simply won't because they're not being paid to. Last ditch effort: ask a Cigna rep to call out to Wageworks and conference them together with Cigna's eligibility department to get the information updated over the phone. Wageworks isn't making the call so their hands aren't tied by your former employer wanting to save pennies. That should be the end of it. If the Cigna rep doesn't know or doesn't understand, ask for a supervisor. You'll probably have to drop off the line for the conferencing to happen, but Cigna reps are pretty good in my experience at calling people back."
HealthInsurance,"This is what I think I should do, just not sure what would be the difference between having bad/good insurance with/without cancer officially diagnosed.

Is bad insurance good enough to treat cancer?

Should I wait till I found some good insurance to get my cancer officially diagnosed?

Could I have 2 health insurance (private and employer)?"
HealthInsurance,"9 times out of ten you pay after deductible. Rarely I’ve seen plans where you pay a cost share before meeting the deductible. 

Based on the way you explained the benefit I’m 99% sure you pay 100% until meeting the deductible. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you!! I really appreciate the help. Everything else seems more or less understandable until I got to the section on alternative medicine LOL. I want to see a chiropractor eventually, so I thought I'd ask. :)"
HealthInsurance,Why dont you buy a critical illness policy? I believe It would pay out if you were diagnosed unless there is a record of a diagnosis or doctor thinkibg that you should get checked out.  Buy an expensive policy and cancel it if you dont have it
HealthInsurance,Sometimes you can contact your chiropractors office and tell them that your insurance has chiro visits subject to the deductible.  Ask them if they have cash payment plans for situations like that.  I did it once and paid the dr 300 dollars for 10 visits.
HealthInsurance,What do you mean by very shitty / bad health insurance? Is it the coverage you're worried about or the network of physicians?
HealthInsurance,"Claims submitted will apply to your deductible first ($60-120 depending on the treatment billed) and once your deductible is met, your patient responsibility will be the 20% of what the insurance allows. (For example, if your insurance approves $100, they will pay $80 and you will be responsible for $20). 

As the comment above mine says, most offices should offer a payment arrangement if you agree to ""x"" amount of visits. 

The typical allowed amount with most insurance carriers for an adjustment is around $40-$60 (depending on the insurance company) if they also perform physical therapy services like therapeutic exercises and massage therapy, then more ($40-60) will apply to the deductible per visit. 

Im a medical biller, so feel free to PM me with any questions you may have =) "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; 1) there are tons of options 

no there's not, not really


&gt;2) and there is no enrollment period. 

but you need to attest to your insurability, policies have limited duration, don't cover pre-existing conditions, and don't satisfy ACA standards for coverage so don't spare you from penalties for not having coverage, which are in force thru 2018.

Other than that, great!


OP, tell us what city &amp; state you're in &amp; you might get more  actionable suggestions"
HealthInsurance,"no penalty for 2 month gap 

don't let it get to 3 months"
HealthInsurance,"mostly coverage I guess, are there any insurance that don't cover some types of cancers?

ps: sorry for the late respinse, I lost my account pass"
HealthInsurance,"yes, this is the kind of options I'm looking for, I'll definitely look up into this, thank you so much.

edit: new account, lost my pass"
HealthInsurance,"yeah, no, that isn't as likely to work as it appears. On receipt of anything like a monster claim, insurer will look back &amp; find .... something.... disqualifying. That or benefit payout will be constrained in ways that might make purchase less than the windfall you might hope for.

Cancer can be difficult to diagnose &amp; then difficult to treat. Your 'discovery' phase may involve moe than a few specialist visits. Identify plan options that give you some flexibility in choice of and access to specialists (basic rule: PPO, with less-generous coverage of NON-network doctors, v HMO - with NO benefit for non-network MD treatment), ideally a plan with a relatively low copay for specialists, and a relatively low maximum annual out-of-pocket limit.

&gt; ....getting diagnosed with cancer (*which would only raise my premium*)?

this doesn't happen under ACA. "
HealthInsurance,"When I went on COBRA, I found there was zero difference in coverage.  My share of the cost did go up however.  However, just like any insurance plan, your employer could change benefits for everyone (usually done at change of a new year)"
HealthInsurance,"If you're in New York, this actually qualifies under the new York state surprise bill law which protects people in these these exact situations. Go to dfs.ny.gov and type 'surprise bill' in the search bar and click on the first link. That pulls up a form that also gives a general definition of this law at the top. You'd fill out the form and attach a copy of your bill from the lab to it and send it to your insurance to get the process started. If all else fails, of course!"
HealthInsurance,"If you can't find an insurance plan with vision, you should look into discount programs, such as VSP.  www.vsp.com"
HealthInsurance,"OK, I'll check that out. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;to my surprise

terms of coverage can vary by policy, rather than by insurer, though as you might expect, there aren't always sharp variations from policy to policy.

&gt;Both meds are listed under my plan as specialty drugs but says I pick up a percentage of the cost.

can you clarify? You opened by suggesting your meds weren't covered under your new plan at all. in the quoted bit it sounds like you're saying your meds are covered, just not at an  affordable tier for you."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"that's ... odd. You have a valid script &amp; they've issued a denial for.... what?

can you post a de-identified copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) your insurer sent you?"
HealthInsurance,Can you tell us what medication you're trying to get?  And what state do you live in?
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"You can try finding your medication in the attached list and finding what the prior authorization requirements are -

HealthInsurance,"&gt; Rejected why? Who knows and nobody at BCBS can tell me. 

they're *obliged* to tell you, and promptly. 

Dig out your plan's Summary Plan Description (SPD), OR your Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) and find the page that tells you how to learn about your right to appeal a claim decision. Your SBC may be easier to locate  and scan through. [it looks like this](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf). The appeals info will typically be in the last page or so. Be polite - but be persistent. Or as my dear departed ma used to say, ""don't let the bastards get you down"""
HealthInsurance,"You are never liable for more than the allowed amount on a paid claim when you go to an in network provider. 

With the numbers you have given, the provider must write off the $800 that was not allowed by your insurance and you would pay no more than your coinsurance, as you have already met your deductible."
HealthInsurance,How would I go about this? Do I call my insurance provider? What would I say to them? (Thanks for the response!)
HealthInsurance,"I'm not sure what you mean.

The provider will receive a remittance from your insurance that shows if their claim was paid or denied and will detail any patient responsibility amounts. They will then bill you for that amount."
HealthInsurance,"Sorry, maybe I'm still not understanding. I only received the explanation of benefits for that anesthesia so far, but no bill yet. Should I expect to see the full bill for roughly $1000 or will I only need to pay the coinsurance? 

Your comment above makes it sound like, even though the patient responsibility on my Explanation of Benefits shows nearly $1000 (with a section that says ""Coinsurance: $150""), I won't be responsible for the difference of $850."
HealthInsurance,"Something's not right here. Are you able to scan and upload your EOB, making sure to redact any private information?

Are you positive your anesthesiologist is in network? Many do not contract with insurance. If they were out of network, the numbers you describe would be accurate."
HealthInsurance,You'll probably get a bill for $150. If it's more than that then call the provider to fix it.
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, let's hope that's the case!"
HealthInsurance,Messaged you a link to the benefits screengrab.
HealthInsurance,"You are effectively purchasing a one year contract, so yes you have to pay for the whole year."
HealthInsurance,"Lesson learned: detailed narratives are great, but getting to the bottom of a case can be tough without source documents"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Odd guess here but year just changed, and many insurance companies are trying to get users to switch to mail order 90 day supply thro their pharmacy. Rather then having you go to local store and getting it filled.  

I've been seeing plan design trend in the other direction, *away* from aggressive mail order incentives. Curious what are others are experiencing?
"
HealthInsurance,"Outside of an open enrollment/election period, there is no law or regulation that would require an employer to terminate anyone voluntarily.

I've never heard of any way an eligible dependent (spouse or child) could terminate their own coverage without the consent/direction of the employee, even during open enrollment.

Assuming this person is unable to get their coverage through their parent's terminated, at a minimum the parent/employee will have access to the name of the patient, the date of service, the place of service (name of provider), and the dollar amounts billed/allowed/paid.

Granted, mistakes can happen, but the insurance company should not provide any information regarding types of treatments, diagnosis, prescribed drugs, and those details.

I would suggest this person call the insurer directly, inform them of the situation, and ask if there are any extra safeguards that can be taken.  It's going to depend upon some of their own internal procedures, but it might be possible to obtain a separate, unique identification number that's different than the employee's, or somehow flag in the system for additional safeguards.

If talking to customer service gets them nowhere, there should be some sort of compliance or privacy officer/office they may contact.  That contact info might be found on the insurer's website or through customer service.

Above that, about all I could think of would be to seek legal counsel - someone who specializes in ERISA, HIPAA, and/or employment law.

As a practical aside, lets say parents have access to everything and there's nothing anyone can do about it.  What would be the potential harm?  If they are going no contact, what would a parent do with medical information?  These are rhetorical questions - but maybe think about what's actually at stake here before spending too much time worrying about this part of things."
HealthInsurance,"Keep in mind, that even though you went to an in-network hospital, many anesthesia professionals are out of network.  If that is the case, they can balance-bill you where you are responsible for any amount over what insurance pays. You'll have to check with your insurance to see how this is handled.  

&lt;sarcasm alert&gt;

Yes, while you're under anesthesia, it's your responsibility to verify that everyone in the room is in-network.  If someone is out of network, they can charge an arbitrary amount and you're on the hook. We have the best healthcare system in the world!

&lt;/sarcasm alert&gt;"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, the only thing that led me to believe the anesthesiologist was in-network was that the coinsurance counted against my in-network out-of-pocket limit. "
HealthInsurance,"If you cancel your enrollment in the ACA, you won’t have coverage thro them.  You probably won’t be able to re sign up to get cover unless you qualify for a life event and have proof of such.

The fee for it having coverage still applies until 2019.( as far as I can tell)

If you have coverage outside the marketplace, ie private insurance or thro employment,  you could cancel your marketplace coverage.   The fee comes from not having any coverage and the IRS.gov website has a handy calculator to figure out what your “fee” could be, based of income, household size and who had/didn’t have coverage for each month of the year."
HealthInsurance,"So...  your reasoning is good, this might be the right choice for you.  My final two cents is that you want to be *really really* sure that you will be able to get group health insurance through new employment within three months or so.  If something truly catastrophic happens that needs ongoing treatment, you won't be able to purchase an ACA policy to replace this one until open enrollment rolls around again for January 1 policies (you only get an ACA special enrollment period if you lose *creditable* coverage).  If you're working as anticipated, this won't be a problem.  If you're not, it could be.  Good luck."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; at a minimum the parent/employee will have access to the name of the patient, the date of service, the place of service (name of provider), and the dollar amounts billed/allowed/paid.

At the company I work for we see diagnosis/procedure codes among other things. If we're lucky it says right in the claim's processing notes what they mean, if not maybe we have to go look them up which we have a program specifically for. And member services reps tell people they shouldn't be talking to things like that every day. All of that stuff is written on EOB's to a great extent too, and if my friend would like those not to be mailed to their parents, they would have to update their address with the insurer which I could also easily see someone providing their parents if they called and asked.

&gt;As a practical aside, lets say parents have access to everything and there's nothing anyone can do about it. What would be the potential harm? If they are going no contact, what would a parent do with medical information? These are rhetorical questions - but maybe think about what's actually at stake here before spending too much time worrying about this part of things.

The fact is that there's a hundred ways to find info about someone, especially with the internet today. I don't want this being one piece of the puzzle that leads them to my friend's new phone number/address. Even if the bare minimum they get from insurance is provider name, that still tells them which city my friend lives in and it's kind of a small one they're going to. There's also the risk that they literally just call that doctor's billing department and say ""Hi I'm [child'sname], here's my date of birth and ssn and insurance id and whatever else you're gonna use to HIPAA verify me that I know because I raised them. Can you tell me exactly where you sent the bill for my copay? I never got it."" If you're really smart you say ""Hi this is myname from InsuranceCompany, I have a member on the line who never received their bill"" and they just tell you everything about it. I do it every day and I've only had two people ever refuse to tell me anything, saying it had to be the patient.

Even if they don't get contact info from this, they're morally opposed to certain things my friend's medical needs require (one of the many reasons to go no contact), and it still gives them ammo to attack my friend over if they find the contact info elsewhere. As well as maybe giving them extra motivation to find my friend.

&gt;I would suggest this person call the insurer directly, inform them of the situation, and ask if there are any extra safeguards that can be taken. It's going to depend upon some of their own internal procedures, but it might be possible to obtain a separate, unique identification number that's different than the employee's, or somehow flag in the system for additional safeguards.

We're working on this. I gave them a list of things to talk to the insurer about and they're going to on Monday. They came to me first because I apparently know everything about insurance even though I only work on a specific type of coverage. Not that I mind, I still want to help them find the right things to bring up when they do call.

&gt;I've never heard of any way an eligible dependent (spouse or child) could terminate their own coverage without the consent/direction of the employee, even during open enrollment.

How is this possible with the direct effect that it has on someone's coverage/life? I can't think of a single other arrangement a parent could force their adult, financially independent child to be part of. Can you enroll an eligible dependent without their consent as well?

I also have a follow-up question that I thought of. People keep telling me that my friend doesn't have to use their parent's insurance, but I was thinking that my friend's new coverage they get on their own would either force them to go through the parent's insurance first (if parent's is primary) and refuse to pay if they didn't, or process the claims and then automatically send the rest of the bill to the parent's insurance (if parent's is secondary). But I was talking to someone at work about this (who still knows as much as me about this type of policy) and they mentioned that our policies work that way for a reason and told me that private and employer insurance does not, but I'm not so sure. When you sign up for insurance on your own, do their terms usually require you to disclose whether you currently have any coverage? Or require you to use them if they're meant to be the primary payer? Am I right in thinking that claims may end up going through this insurance whether my friend wants them to or not?"

HealthInsurance,"Don’t pay the stupid penalty.  There are many exemptions you can take to avoid paying it. If you don’t pay it, the IRS cannot force you to pay it.

Bottom line- don’t worry about it. Next year it won’t even be a question. "
HealthInsurance,"Go online to healthcare.gov.   There’s a search bar on top right. Type in exemptions. It will pull up search results and one of the first ones will be a handy tool to walk you thro question by question what exemptions you may qualify for and how to apply for them.

There is a fee for 2018 for not having insurance. The IRS will take it out of your taxes and can possibly charge you a late fee. I do recommend going to IRS.gov and checking that out.

From what I read of your situation, you very well may be eligible for a fee exemptions so you won’t be hit with a penalty.

HealthInsurance,"Marriage should be a qualifying life event that will let you enroll your new bride without waiting for your employer's open enrollment period. Go to your employer and get her signed up, and once she's fully enrolled as of a particular date, then you can drop the parent's insurance. That way there's no period she's uncovered. DO NOT DELAY, as a QLE has a clock on it, usually 60 days. If you miss that window, you'd have to wait for the yearly open enrollment slot to sign her up."
HealthInsurance,"What state?

And you literally have to call the state office about your Medicaid application. A lot. 

They get slammed with applications and renewals this time of year and getting answers slow way down.

Unfortunately the marketplace, healthcare.gov, can’t do a lot until that state Medicaid decides what they are doing.  Ether approve it and your covered or deny you, thus “possibly” opening a special enrollment period for you because you were denied Medicaid.

It’s all depends on many factors, and who says what.

You can go online to healthcare.gov and there’s a search bar top right. Type in income limits.  
It will have some search results and one is a tool that you can enter household size, state.
It will show you the basic income limit for your state.

If you're young-ish, and in the right part of the  US, your marketplace coverage will only cost you around $250-300/month even without tax credits.

Optum is a 3rd party that exists specifically to recover claims UHC paid in error. Optum also has their own appeal process separate from UHC. It sounds like the doctor tried to resubmit a claim to UHC with the kaiser denials instead of giving those denials to Optum.

I know this sounds like a fucking nightmare, and it is, but this is the best advice i can give without actually seeing the claims/letters."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. I would really like to see some actual documentation as well, but even I do not have that.

Shouldn't our doctor know to submit to Optum? How does anyone know when they should submit to Optum instead of UHC? Why wouldn't UHC direct it to Optum? That hasn't been mentioned to us before so I'm trying to learn where we went wrong here.

HealthInsurance,"&gt;he qualified for Medicaire so now he is on Medicaire and we pay $500 a month for that.

Good for you to lend a hand to your dad with stuff like this. 


You - your dad - shouldn't be paying $500 a month for Medicare. You're missing something. 

He wouldn't pay anything for Part A (covers hospital treatment). He'd pay a monthly premium for Part B; 90% of Medicare beneficiaries pay $134 or less for that. 

He may be eligible for plans that supplement Medicare (Medicare Supplement plans), or essentially take the place of original Medicare coverage (Medicare Advantage plans), but those won't typically cost him $500/month - the latter, particularly.

If you can dig up some more specifics we might be able to confirm whether your dad's in a good coverage place, or whether he might be able to find a better coverage arrangement."
HealthInsurance,"ok, so I was gonna report this as spam ;-D


but first, I really have to know - at what point do YOU appear in this genius clip?"
HealthInsurance,Okay yeah I looked a little more closely we are paying $500 a month for both blue Cross AND Medicaire combined so we pay $264 for Medicaire a month. Sorry I'm still figuring things out. That sounds reasonable right?
HealthInsurance,"&gt; so we pay $264 for Medicaire a month.

again - that's over $100/month more than Medicare Part B should cost your dad. So something's STILL missing.


Is dad keeping his company-sponsored coverage so YOU have insurance? If so, you might want to find out what kind of coverage you could get for you, outside of the employer's coverage. You might wind up paying less overall, without lesser benefits.

We'd need details to figure it out, because all health coverage is ""local"" - subject to individual factors like your age, your expected income, your health status, and particularly, your location (city, state)."

Pay off debt beyond the match contribution. If you don’t have debt, consider moving moneys into an investment account and/or buy some term life insurance.

ALSO, and should’ve mentioned this, the 2018 contribution limit is $3,450. That’s the TOTAL contribution (you and your employer), so you contributing $2,500 is a no go, as that will be a total contribution of $3,500 and you’ll be penalized for the amount over 3,450."

HealthInsurance,"**Please call both insurance carriers and update your coordination of benefits. Also, update your providers' billing departments so they submit claims correctly.**

Does the amount my secondary insurance pays go toward my out-of-pocket maximum on the primary?
&gt; No, Your primary plan will process without consideration to any other plan because it is primary. The secondary plan shall calculate the benefits it would have paid on the claim in the absence of other health care coverage and apply the calculated amount to any allowable expense under its plan that is unpaid by the primary plan. The secondary plan may reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the primary plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all plans for the claim do not exceed 100 percent of the total allowable expense for that claim. In addition, the secondary plan shall credit to its plan deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other health care coverage.

What happens if the new plan declines a claim? Does it just go to the secondary to be processed like the primary insurance doesn't exist?
&gt; In the event your primary insurance denies a service, you or your provider should submit that denial to your secondary insurance for consideration. Your secondary insurance still needs the information on how the primary insurance processed the claim whether or not the service is covered.

If the two insurance plans require I use different specialty pharmacies, how does that work?
&gt;You coordinate benefits in the same way. You'll want to use the specialty pharmacy that affiliated under your primary plan and submit the claim to your secondary plan for consideration.

Are there any differences if the two plans are both from the same insurance company? I have a choice of plans, so could choose one from my current company or from a different one.
&gt;I would suggest staying with the same insurance company for both plans. Provided customer services sets up the coordination of benefits and claims handling notices correctly, once your provider submits it to the first plan, the insurance company should process it under both plans without any intervention from you. Additionally, staying with the same insurance company for both plans reduces your risk for paying out unnecessarily. See the next response for the explanation.

Are there any ways I'm not thinking of that having two plans could come back to bite me?
&gt;If the two plans are with separate insurance companies, you risk the provider charging you more. The point of using an in-network provider is to receive a member rate or discounted allowed amount. The issue is that the provider's contract can change between companies. This relates to how claims will be reimbursed by the secondary insurance. The secondary plan shall calculate the benefits it would have paid on the claim in the absence of other health care coverage and apply the calculated amount to any allowable expense under its plan that is unpaid by the primary plan. **The secondary plan may reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the primary plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all plans for the claim do not exceed 100 percent of the total allowable expense for that claim.** In addition, the secondary plan shall credit to its plan deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other health care coverage.
&gt;Let's assume the provider is participating with both plans. Let's also assume your primary plan has a higher negotiated amount that the secondary insurance. The secondary insurance can only pay up to their negotiated amount less what was already paid by the primary plan. **The provider, however, may collect up to the highest negotiated amount.**

**Plan 1**

* Submitted Amount: $5,000

* Negotiated Amount: $2,000

* Normal Benefit: $0 (Let's assume, high deductible)

* Patient Responsibility: $2,000

**Plan 2**

* Submitted Amount: $5,000

* Negotiated Amount: $1,500

* Normal Benefit: $1,200 (Let's assume, you only have a $300 deductible, then 100% covered)

* COB Payable Amount: $1,200 (Your primary insurance didn't pay anything, so we're paying our normal benefit)

* Patient Responsibility: $800 = $300 (Your deductible under your secondary plan) + $500 (the difference between the negotiated amounts)"

HealthInsurance,"I'm very sorry you're dealing with this.  With her current hospital bills the hospital may offer a charity care program that will heavily reduce or even eliminate most of her bills.  Going forward -  Open enrollment is over for the year meaning that your mother won't be able to buy a policy without a qualifying event (Like moving or getting married).  Texas didn't expand Medicaid under the ACA - But they do offer coverage to adults with disabilities.  Your mother will most likely not be able to be added to your sister's policy - I have seen very few policies that allow you to add anyone other than a spouse or child.  If she doesn't qualify for either it's possible to continue to receive care under a hospital's charity care program or at a Federally Qualified Health Center - Which provide care at very reduced prices. Could you also please answer a few questions?

1) What county does your mother live in?  
2) Was your mother working before being hospitalized?  If so, how much was her yearly earnings?
3) Does she plan to for back to work?
4) Does she have any medications she now has to take?  Any upcoming procedures or doctor visits scheduled?"
HealthInsurance,"Very, very sorry for your predicament.

What's mom's financial situation? Does she/might she qualify for Medicaid in Texas? (All states have mostly-federally-financed Medicaid programs, but each state can, &amp; does, apply its own operational  provisions). 

All health coverage is ""local"" - options, and costs, depend a lot on your ""local"" circumstances, of place (city, state), age, health, income, etc. So sharing details is vital to obtaining responses you can act on - or at least narrowing the range of places you might seek options.

EDIT: sorry, I'd opened this topic, got involved in something else, pecked out a post, then discovered you've had some useful replies already. Still, more info = better quality replies, &amp; probing TX medicaid qualification rules may still be fruitful (spoiler alert though: Texas is a horrible place for health coverage &amp; health treatment prices)"
HealthInsurance,"You are in exactly the right place. And also, this is exactly what we do. So, in addition to the other questions that have been asked below, we need to know if she is now considered disabled. You might want to speak to a disability attorney, she might be eligible for SSI and SSDI, depending on her condition.

Although it takes 24 months of being disabled before you qualify for Medicare, she might be able to use her income from SSI and SSDI, assuming she is approved, as qualifying income towards a subsidized plan.

One of the things that has occasionally worked, in order to trigger a new enrollment period, is for her to move. And by that I mean, her principal address should change, at least across zip codes, preferably across counties. Sometimes the marketplace allows that as a triggering point for a special enrollment period. It doesn't always work. Also, she should apply for Medicaid regardless, because if she gets denied, she may be able to use that to trigger another special enrollment period. It happens."

HealthInsurance,"About the first point - regarding the OOP max on the primary plan.  Your response may be a little misleading.

&gt;Does the amount my secondary insurance pays go toward my out-of-pocket maximum on the primary?

As far as you, the patient is concerned, yes it does (sort of, though technically not).

It doesn't matter what happens or who actually pays anything.  Generally, any remaining balance due after the primary processes the claim applies to the out-of-pocket max.  This will depend on the plan.  Some plans don't apply copays to the oop max, etc.  

The primary insurance doesn't care who pays the balance or even if it is paid - it just applies whatever balance is left to the OOP max."

HealthInsurance,"Thanks so much!!! Follow-up questions:
&gt; In the event your primary insurance denies a service, you or your provider should submit that denial to your secondary insurance for consideration. Your secondary insurance still needs the information on how the primary insurance processed the claim whether or not the service is covered.

But if the secondary insurer usually covers the service, they'll cover it regardless of whether the primary does, right?

&gt; You coordinate benefits in the same way. You'll want to use the specialty pharmacy that affiliated under your primary plan and submit the claim to your secondary plan for consideration.

Will the secondary plan pay my copays/coinsurance, though, if it's a different insurer, since it's not the specialty pharmacy they use?

Also, that's interesting about the negotiated amount issue, and definitely not something I would have considered. How much of an issue is that, do you think, other than the deductible? Both plans I'll have are quite good, so it'd have to be a pretty massive price disparity to kick over to me, right? I sometimes have tests/medicines my insurer won't cover, and having a different insurer will definitely up the odds that I can get one plan or another to agree to cover it."

HealthInsurance,"Your optometrist gives you the rx on a piece of paper, you plug it in to the website."
HealthInsurance,"But if the secondary insurer usually covers the service, they'll cover it regardless of whether the primary does, right?
&gt;If the primary insurance denies, and the secondary insurance has proof of that denial from the explanation of benefits, then the secondary insurance will cover it according to its benefits. If the primary insurance makes any payment, the secondary insurance must have proof of such payment from the explanation of benefits. Then the secondary insurance will reduce its payment by any amount already paid by the primary insurance so payment does not exceed 100% of the allowable expense.

Will the secondary plan pay my copays/coinsurance, though, if it's a different insurer, since it's not the specialty pharmacy they use?
&gt;Only one specialty pharmacy can fill your medication, right? It's not like you can ask two different pharmacies to fill the same medication. You would have double. So, if you already know the specialty pharmacy under the primary plan is not in-network with the secondary plan, then the secondary plan would possibly process that claim towards its out-of-network benefits, if you plan has such.

How much of an issue is that, do you think, other than the deductible?
&gt;Ultimately, it depends on the negotiated rates that a provider has with different insurance carriers and what the secondary insurance considers to the ""allowable expense"" to be when they are secondary. The insurance companies may not always be able to give you an exact rate for services because contracts are not always set up with fix costs for services.

Both plans I'll have are quite good, so it'd have to be a pretty massive price disparity to kick over to me, right?
&gt;Yes, for the most part. "
HealthInsurance,"It may because of processing backlogs in Michigan DHHS, and there is a chance situation resolves automatically."
HealthInsurance,He's be hard pressed to find comparable insurance for cheaper than what he has through his employer.
HealthInsurance,I agree.
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,thanks so much
HealthInsurance,"&gt; people under 30

:("
HealthInsurance,"Did you lose coverage recently?  Also, what school do you attend?"
HealthInsurance,Yeah I lost it a few months ago around July. The school I'm attending isn't well known. I'll pm you the name of the school.
HealthInsurance,"You don't have to be under 30 to get a catastrophic plan, but that is probably the easiest way to get it. You can also qualify for a hardship exemption: https://www.ehealthinsurance.com/health-plans/catastrophic-insurance"
HealthInsurance,Open enrollment has closed and it doesn't sound like you qualify for a special enrollment period.  You may be able to get coverage through your school though.
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"thank you! and i just checked out the link, and found some more affordable rates. however, i saw in one option that the deductible is $0. does that mean i only have to pay the prices listed for a doctor's visit (copay of $25) and generic medicine (copay of $15)?

it also says under the hospital section of the plan, it says there's ""No Charge"" for Inpatient Physical and Surgical Services. Does that mean that surgery is free? i find that hard to believe"
HealthInsurance,"HSA is linked to a high deductible insurance plan. If your parents and you have this kind of plan, you can open a HSA thru them. You can check with HR but I'm pretty sure you won't be able to do that thru your company regardless of the plan your parents have."
HealthInsurance,It goes by date of service
HealthInsurance,"A lot. I try not to hold it against providers' office staff since insurance reimbursment _is_ confusing, but I don't really feel most of them know what a deductible really is or how contractual reductions work."
HealthInsurance,"I would also recommend letting Cigna _know_ you have Medi-Cal so they can put it in their systems. Otherwise, eventually legitimate claims are going to get pended asking ""we realized you have some other insurance. Mind telling us what it is?"""
HealthInsurance,"For your first question, yes. Second one, I'm not sure but it sounds like it? If it has a $0 deductible it might honestly just be a really good plan. I would call and ask though, I wonder if that's only for emergency services or something. "
HealthInsurance,"You must be participating with an HSA-compatibe qualified high deductible health plan in order to contribute to an HSA.  Unless your parents' plan is HSA compatible, you can't open or contribute to a HSA while you're on their healthcare plan."
HealthInsurance,Thanks
HealthInsurance,"My suggestion would be to look for a plan with low drug cost-sharing.  That is, look for low drug copays that won't be subject to a big deductible first.  Look for the plan's formulary and check what drug tier your prescriptions fall under to estimate your out of pocket costs.


Rather than looking only at the metal tiers, I would also actually call the specific insurance companies offering coverage and ask them about what they do for their members with diabetes.  Since diabetes is a disease that responds so well to being organized, a lot of insurance companies have extra diabetic services that you won't see listed on the summary of benefits.  Some places offer some basic dental coverage to people with diabetes or lower cost-sharing for foot care or discount supplies through the mail.


Good luck.  Other readers might have more insight than I do, diabetes is a tricky disease to manage affordably.  "
HealthInsurance,"Oof - you have a lot going on here.
So, let me get this straight - your ex-wife and your daughter have insurance through your ex-wife's employer and your daughter also has Medicaid.  You get insurance through TriCare, which your daughter would also qualify for.  Your ex-wife's premium costs for her and your daughter just went way up and it's become unaffordable.  Is my understanding correct?

If your daughter's on Medicaid, there's no financial reason why you would need for her to be on either of your insurance plans.  But I think your ex-wife's employer is correct, and your daughter being renewed with Medicaid is not a qualifying event.


Did your wife just have open enrollment?  It's unusual for cost sharing to jump so much in the middle of a plan year. 
 If so, she needs to work with HR ASAP and get any evidence she can to HR or better yet her company's broker that she wanted to change her enrollment and drop your daughter from the plan.  It might not work, but it might not be too late.  Good luck.


"
HealthInsurance,"It is HSA compatible, as he has a HSA account"
HealthInsurance,My reading of the question is that OP doesn't have an HSA account yet and wants to know if they can get one.
HealthInsurance,"sorry, I am OP but I mistyped.  I mean the plan I am on is HSA compatible as my dad already has a HSA account"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Should I pay for healthy insurance using Cobra

no need to decide immediately. [Here's a walkthru of a COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) that can provide a low-or-no-current-cash-outlay way to evaluate your options a few extra weeks. Not having insurance IS an option - not a very prudent one"
HealthInsurance,"if by ""very expensive"" you mean ""I would be required to pay 10% or more of my pay for the plan's premiums"", you may be able to purchase marketplace coverage - better than short-term policies you have to submit health status information to qualify for -  AND qualify for premium tax credits.


If on the other hand you mean ""I just don't want to pay more than $50/month for health coverage, more than that I ""can't pay"""", you're out of luck either way"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; a lot of insurance companies have extra diabetic services that you won't see listed on the summary of benefits.

so much this. Bijou's exactly right - you need to get into the weeds of each plan option's coverage terms to know if they're doing special things for diabetics.

Look for each plan's ""Evidence of Coverage"" document - it's typically scores to hundreds of pages long &amp; gets into considerable detail on plan features - much more so than the mostly worthless marketing brochures insurers make much more prominent on their websites.

If you can't find these documents via searching their websites  - and you'll want the documents specifically for the plans you can enroll in - contact their customer service people and ask them to send you a link to the PDF of the document. 

Even if you find the EOC on your own, and one plan's diabetes care provisions look more attractive than others, call up to ask additional detailed questions to confirm that what they have will work for you."
HealthInsurance,"Oh hi!  Ok, in that case you can totally get an HSA account, it's a great benefit to get started on young.  It's my understanding as an insurance broker that, so long as you have a compatible plan, you can open up an HSA where ever you would like, although your employer might have set up some participation restrictions for the one they offer to their employees.  Check with HR.  Good luck :)"
HealthInsurance,"Yes.  Also adding that short term won't cover anything pre-existing and doesn't shield you from the tax penalty. "
HealthInsurance,"Ok.  So you have a referral and your doctor suggested that you go to a particular Dermatology office, but you don't have to go to that one. Check with your Medi-Cal provider, and see who else is in network for you."
HealthInsurance,"Symetra is a massive company,  can you link to the program you're interested in? "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks Bijous, I appreciate your help. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks man! I’ll definitely call &amp; see what they tell me. "
HealthInsurance,"Billing for births typically pays for a set number of prenatal visits, plus the vaginal or caesarian birth.  If there are complications insurance sometimes pays more, but normal healthy births are usually paid at a bundled rate.


I might call your insurance company to ask about this to make sure."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; It's my understanding as an insurance broker that, so long as you have a compatible plan, you can open up an HSA where ever you would like

Not so fast, OP - check with dad to find out how much he's salting away. The maximum is driven by the number of covered by the HDHP; the cap for self-only is lower (by half, maybe?) than for ""family"", ie, more than 1 covered  under the  HDHP).

Frankly I'm not sure how opening multiple accounts would work; how, for example, two ""competing"" financial institutions would ensure that only the ""permitted""sum was deposited in the total of the two accounts. That responsibility may, in fact, lie with the account-opening party(s)."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Im afraid they'll take alot of money out of tax returns

sure sounds like ""coverage"" that doesn't satisfy ACA requirements - so penalties may indeed apply for 2018."
HealthInsurance,I would check with your school to see if they have a student health plan those are usually the cheapest and have the best coverage if that doesn't work I would look into some of these healthshare companies like Liberty healthshare that's if you're relatively healthy you can probably just get the cheapest plan there.
HealthInsurance,"Your coverage starts in Feb if you sign up by 1/14- for 12/20 it starts in Jan. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;he was forced to register for a new plan because of his updated income he is no longer eligible for his current health insurance plan.

Is there any chance your dad wasn't notified of the change in his coverage status early enough to make a coverage change? If you can document a case like that there may be some value in filing an administrative appeal via NYState of Health. Otherwise, what Danes said...."
HealthInsurance,"Ok I misread the question. So the 30 days allows the parents some grace time to find a plan for baby, but once they have a plan, all the bills related to baby, since birth, are applied to baby's plan.  If the parents add baby to thier own family plan, there might be some savings in terms of family deductible and such, but nothing is for sure.  If the OP can qualify for CHIP low income coverage for kids, it worth looking into.  Thr income threshold is better for kids than for adults."
HealthInsurance,"First of all, I'm going to cop to not knowing *anything* about taxes.

That said,  whether or not she qualifies for Medicaid as well as the rest of your family, is going to depend on what state they are moving too. Unlike the National Health Service, Medicaid Eligibility is determined state-by-state.

When she applies for Medicaid, she should apply listing all the people who live in the household. This does not include you. 

The children will qualify for Medicaid regardless of the state, but whether or not she qualifies will depend on the state that she moves too.

On a completely unrelated note, I have family in Aberdeen. Whenever I want to visit them, I always use Icelandair to get there. It's usually the cheapest."
HealthInsurance,"Hiya:

First, do you have insurance? If you do, make sure that you are going to places that are ""in network"" for your insurance (call the insurer, and get a list of urgent care that takes it).

If you don't, or your copay is stupid high, for simple stuff, you can use [amwell](https://amwell.com/#).  It's a telemedicine service; you see a doctor via streaming video.  They can diagnose most simple things like infections and antibiotics.  That service is $59/visit.

Alternately, [freedomtelemedicine](www.freedomtelemedicine.com) offers a subscription service; unlimited visits for a family for $260/year or $194/year for an individual.

Just as a reminder; this won't go against your insurance copay unless you have very specific insurance (usually, aetna and cigna)

Hope that helps.  "
HealthInsurance,"Yes I do have insurance. Looking to drop the copay/deductible amount to the cheapest possible in network with just the cheapest version of a visit.  "
HealthInsurance,"If you drop your group coverage, then you will be subjected to the shared responsibility tax penalty. Just FYI. But you are not bound to having to use the ACA or waiting until next November. You can definitely get any number of private plans that are available. Just don't get anything that's Short-Term or a limited Benefit plan. Those are essentially scam insurances for the most part."
HealthInsurance,"Just a heads up, even private ACA compliant plans arent sold outside of open enrollment. Because we have to cover preexisting conditions, letting people enroll whenever they want would cause insurance companies to go under real quick."
HealthInsurance,"Doc in a box places (Minute Clinic, TLC, etc.) and telemedicine might be cheaper for simple stuff like that.

ETA: I should read more thoroughly, /u/daneslord has this covered. Anthem also has their own telemedicine solution called LiveHealth Online. Not sure if any of the other large carriers not mentioned like UHC or Humana have their own."
HealthInsurance,"Is your old plan ending and they are giving you a new plan, or is the price just going up? Did the new plan go into effect Jan 1? And what is your income? 

Those questions will help me figure out if you qualify for an exception to the open enrollment period. "
HealthInsurance,Getting married should be a qualifying life event. She should be able to sign up at healthcare.gov with an ACA plan at that point.
HealthInsurance,"Sorry, I wasn't clear on that. I was just mind boggled at the time.

No change in plans, just the price jumps from 6000 to nearly 7000 per year. (I edited the original post to show the low rounding of the nearly cost. I was looking at my 2017 sheet when I made the post.)

I make 60k flat. My understudy has is own insurance through United Healthcare, I quoted a similar plan to his which ends up with better coverage, lower out of pocket and deductible.

If I can dump work insurance, I would use my health reimbursement account, through work, to pay for the premiums."
HealthInsurance,"Makes sense... Like when you switch car insurances, they want the car inspected before OKAYing the policy."
HealthInsurance,"Did you contribute to an HSA, IRA, or 401k last year? Or alimony or student loan interest?"
HealthInsurance,"About $18,800.

I don't have a paystub from the temp agency, but the ones I know for sure add up to $18,015. 

$13,866 is from the months I was fully employed (Aug-Dec) with employer health insurance, if that makes a difference."
HealthInsurance,"Yes to 401k. Never Married/No Alimony, No Student Loans."
HealthInsurance,"How much to the 401k? You are close to a numerical affordability threshold and I’m trying to get you over it, haha. Also, any moving expenses?"
HealthInsurance,"Nope, Haven't moved. I contributed 3413.82, employer contributed $2875.00. I have until the 5th to figure this out. Thats when our Cafeteria plan submissions are do"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Not asking for free stuff. Just advice. I freaked out a little because I have to see my dr on a regular and have several prescriptions that I take regular. Not having insurance is a big deal. 

"
HealthInsurance,"Ok,that makes sense then. I've never had to deal with insurance errors and cancellations, didnt know what to think."
HealthInsurance,"I might also add that in the meantime, thinking I had no coverage, took out insurance with another company. The bcbs is better coverage so I cancelled the second company. I think they are going to reimburse my payment,it was 14 days after the fact. 

Its just been irritating, frustrating and a whole lotta time on hold."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, pay the policy premium and ask your provider to resubmit the claim to BCBS. If the provider gives any hassle, call your BCBS member services and have them call the provider for you, they can even conference call with you, so you can listen in and make sure they get it done."
HealthInsurance,"I make more than that, thanks.
"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Am I missing something here?

no, not really

I doubt there's a devious scheme involved, but the current congressionial majority doesn't want anyone to like anything about the health coverage statute they can't manage to repeal, so....coincidence? Yeah, that is probably all it is"
HealthInsurance,"Hey man, if you got a moment could you look at these? https://imgur.com/a/B2Y0A  These are two pictures of my tooth that was told I need to have it root canaled and two other pictures of what they told me was a light cavity. (I'm not sure which is which, just asked for this years xrays to give to the new dentist office)

I got a discount plan that will cover 80% of the costs for the procedure hopefully but I'm getting cleaning/examined this Wednesday and then maybe the root canal next Saturday. Will my tooth/ I be okay over this week time period you think?

There is a visible hole in my tooth, is there anything I should do to keep it safe when I eat?"
HealthInsurance,"You have quite a large occlusal cavity on tooth 18. That needs to be root canaled. Also most of your cavities are between the teeth. You need to floss better. My only advice is to brush, floss, rinse after you eat and get that tooth root canal asap before it reaches the nerve."
HealthInsurance,"If it makes you feel any better I had BCBS through the marketplace for a little over 2 years and constantly had issues with my account being cancelled or my payment not going into my account. At one point they figured out that I somehow managed to have two accounts in their system and one was an expired acct from California, where I never lived. It was very frustrating. Just make sure you keep a record of when you call and who you talk to. It helps if you’re organized."
HealthInsurance,"I'm not sure you did this correctly.  How many people are in your household, ages and sexs please, and how much would it cost to just insure yourself?  Also, what's your yearly gross?

Just fyi, you don't always have to have the same insurance as your daughters; it is often cheaper to have the workers have their employer's health insurance, and the kids something else.  "
HealthInsurance,"if i went with my new employer to cover myself is $72 a month. to cover myself and the kids is $600.

yearly gross is 58000"
HealthInsurance,i don't qualify for the tax credit on marketplace because my new work offers health insurance though its not NOT affordable.
HealthInsurance,"yeah, I was checking for that.  This is called the ""family gap"".  Your insurance is a great price; definitely have that for you - you don't need to be on the same plan as your kids.  

May I ask what their ages are, and what county you live in?  I can try and price you out.  There are some carriers that offer policies off the exchange.  "
HealthInsurance,"off exchange does that mean non ACA compliant and therefore I will paying a fine at the end of the tax year?

im 37, kids are 6 and 3 BEXAR county
not many providers for that country which sucks!!

it may be a great price but I cannot afford it.
I have mortgage credit cards, loans, bills AND day care to pay off which leaves me nothing. "
HealthInsurance,"nno no no.  We never recommend non ACA plans here; ever ever.  It's just that some carriers have decided not to offer their plans via the federal marketplace; but still offer them.  I'm going to try and run this for you, and report back."
HealthInsurance,whats your email address and I will email you?

HealthInsurance,"Thanks, I'm going to give them a call this week."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"No usually you can't stock up on medications, insurance will only pay for a 30 day supply every 30 days. First go to goodrx.com see how much the perscription costs via their discount program, if it doesn't save you a lot I would lookup a bronze plan with good perscription coverage and do an analysis to see which is cheaper."
HealthInsurance,"Are you in school? If so see if your school has a student health insurance plan, they can cost 50 to 75 percent less with identical or better coverage."
HealthInsurance,"So I called the insurance back this morning and this rep seemed a bit better informed. I initially asked the exact same question and he said it depends on the reason why I want it out and how the procedure is coded. If it's because it's expired then yes it's covered 100%. If I wanted it out because of a known side effect, then it would not be. 

In my case, this should be the answer I want and I can make sure to talk to the person who removes it and make sure they code it as expired. I'm a little worried since I had it put in under a different insurance, in a different state that I might not have ""proof"" I've had it for three years? But I have the tools I need to fight it after-the-fact if needed! "
HealthInsurance,I'm pretty sure open enrollment has already passed for this year.
HealthInsurance,"We need details OP - where you are (city, state), age, expected annual income for starters. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Is it possible to get health insurance short term? 

sure - but it won't cover this thing you've got now, or treatment related to it.

Check  your area's [community health centers](http://www.nachc.org/about-our-health-centers/find-a-health-center/). They can at least provide direction, if not a full-blown clinical assessment for you"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Is there a law that states I am guaranteed a few months of coverage after I leave my job?

a what now? Have you been in America long?"
HealthInsurance,"Chicago, Illinois. No income. Currently a student and have no income "
HealthInsurance,"I know the open enrollment has passed. Wanting to know if gettin denied from Medicaid still slows me to get insurance via market place "
HealthInsurance,I think this might qualify as a life event and you can apply through the market place with a denial letter from medicaid.  Look on healthcare.gov for the answer to that question.
HealthInsurance,"This is just infuriating! "
HealthInsurance,Hello.  Did you enter your income on the website? What is your gross yearly income and your county?
HealthInsurance,"Yes. My base pay is $2.14 an hour and then tipped wages. I don't feel comfortable putting my gross yearly income but the yearly cost would be close to half of my yearly income which seems way too high. "
HealthInsurance,"Hey, so your income gets you subsidies...you need to put it in the application."
HealthInsurance,"This exactly. You want to put what you file on your taxes at end of the year. Something very very close to it. 

You should be getting a tax credit or “subsidy” based of income. Which in turn should lower the monthly premium cost of those insurance plans."
HealthInsurance,It worked for me!  Denial in early January so I'll be covered starting 2-1.
HealthInsurance,"Talk to a local broker, they are usually the best help."
HealthInsurance,"When I was a server I always qualified for Medicaid, definitely look into applying for that!"
HealthInsurance,Kansas hasn't expanded medicaid.
HealthInsurance,"I work in mental health in Colorado and there are insurance companies which, although we have a contract with them, we refuse to accept patients for certain procedures because the insurer is difficult to work with. For example, we'll have someone who clearly needs day treatment for at least 2 weeks which costs ~900/day but to save $$, the insurance company will only authorize 4 days of day then tell us we need to see the patient individually 3x/wk for the next month for $100/visit. We don't have enough appointment spots to do that plus it doesn't give the patient the care they need. So after they do this enough times, we refuse to see their patients in that program. It's completely legal. Now the kicker is, insurance companies will eventually realize that their patients in the area need that care and will usually start to change course and say that if we see their patients they'll auth what we ask for. The only thing is I'm wondering if your procedure is common enough for them to be motivated to change. Try asking around to other facilities (even ask the one you're looking at... chances are they can point you in a good direction since they can't help you), chances are someone in the area will try and get that pre-auth for you. 
EDIT: adding on, since it's just an ""office rule"" you might be able to get them to try if you bug them enough, or have someone from Cigna reach out to them and tell them they want them to get the auth (which implies they're willing to grant it)."
HealthInsurance,"Honestly, it's not as bad as people say. Most people are poor and don't want to pay. Which is why some people view it as ""good"" that the individual mandate is gone. The issue is most people aren't as smart or have as much foresight as they think they do and end up needed emergency surgery that the hospitals have to write off because the person doesn't have insurance which raises everyone else's premiums. I'd go talk to a local broker that can sign you up for a good company...or just google around for health insurance marketplaces (online brokerages) and get some quotes from them, they usually have people who can talk to you on the phone who are based in the US."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! I’ll look into updating my application! "
HealthInsurance,"Excellent. Also, if you choose a silver plan, not only are your premiums subsidized, but the amount you have to pay for services is subsidized as well."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you sooo much for responding.  So, did you end up paying for insurance?"
HealthInsurance,looks like sola has your solution....yay?
HealthInsurance,"all health coverage is ""local"". Your options, and their costs to you, depend a lot on your particular circumstances - of geographic location, age, expected income, expected health treatment needs, and more.

So, what's your story?"
HealthInsurance,"A good customer service person should be able to walk you thru the bill. But you have to find them first. I got a supervisor who knew less than me! There is also often a way to dispute or challenge a payment.  I think the best may be to wait a bit. Charges and payments can take a while to sort themselves out. Go ahead and ask more questions, but I wouldn't pay much yet, in case there were errors. It takes a long time to get re-imbursed for an over-payment to a medical facility.

Also, ask if someone can fully explain all the fine print of Usual and Customary, Maximum Allowable billing, Balance Billing etc. If the insurance is thru an employer, someone in HR may help. Also talk to someone in the billing department at the hospital. Yes, it's tiresome and confusing, but you seem very well informed and it's worth it. "
HealthInsurance,"I'm not certain but I believe UHC's ""Community Plans"" is a marketing label for plans UHC offers principally for dual eligibles - people eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. 

In short, seldom for someone who is under age 65."
HealthInsurance,"25 year old, white, male, living in central Illinois, income in the 50k range, hardly ever need the doctor, no real pre-existing conditions, probably considered overweight if BMI is the measurement used"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Look at the summary of benefits and coverage; compare both plans, and see what you'll have to pay under both plans.

OP, [here's a graphic that provides a model of the kind of comparison you want to make for your plan options](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif)"
HealthInsurance,"Well, you're young enough to qualify for catastrophic marketplace coverage options. In Springfield IL those start at around $270/month. 

But you missed the annual enrollment window for coverage, so this info may be moot, unless you're ready to move to NY or Washington DC, where open enrollment periods are still ongoing. What were you doing during the 2017 enrollment period most everywhere else, including IL - November 1 to December 15?"
HealthInsurance,I was and still am on my dad's insurance for the time being. I want to get off of it and find something cheaper though. I was hopeful there would be options lower than the one you mentioned.
HealthInsurance,"good to hear you have coverage now.

So, you have ~$50k annual income - no employer-sponsored coverage? If you're self-employed, have you looked into any options as an 'employer'? (I'm not sure if IL enables self-employed to establish 1-person ""group"" plans)"
HealthInsurance,I just graduated college and am about to start my job. There is health insurance offered but it's pretty poor coverage and expensive. So I wanted to know third party options.
HealthInsurance,I believe it's usually offered to those who are on SSI and receive food stamps
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  it's usually offered to those who are on SSI and receive food stamps

by ""it's"" do you mean Medicaid? because sure - but that may not be within the UHC Community Plan marketing penumbra"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; pretty poor coverage and expensive

Again, all health coverage is ""local"". Do a Total Cost of Coverage comparison of your employer's coverage vs marketplace plans. [Here's what that comparison can look like](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif). "
HealthInsurance,"By it I mean the UHC dual community plan "
HealthInsurance,"No, UHC Community Plan is usually offered only to those on Medicaid and/or those who have Medicaid + Medicare. It's not short term, it is ""legit"" in that it's a large insurer that does business in many states in both commercial/private/employer and Medicare/Medicaid plans. It's not necessarily better than other options. It's always best to look at the total premiums + out of pocket costs along with which providers are in network (mainly: are the providers you prefer in network?)."
HealthInsurance,"What state are you in? If you are losing eligibility for parents' plan due to age changing, you may qualify for a special enrollment period in Marketplace coverage (which will be ACA mandate compliant). The mandate still applies for 2018.
That said, because your employer offers you self-only insurance that appears to cost you less than 9.5% of your MAGI, you're probably not eligible for the APTC (Tax Credits) that would make Marketplace insurance cheaper. Your employer sponsored insurance appears to be considered ""Affordable"" under federal law."
HealthInsurance,"Also are you only offered this one plan by your employer? What is the deductible/copays? Can you share the ""Summary of Benefits and Coverage"" document? Your HR department should have the SBC document available on a website or on request."
HealthInsurance,"Some Medicaid HMO/EPO plans do require you to choose a PCP (Primary Care Provider) however this is usually changeable at some future point. If you have Traditional Medicaid directly from a state government you can go to ""Any Willing Provider"" that accepts Medicaid in most states. Also for a select few people that abuse the system, Medicaid may restrict them to one doctor, one pharmacy, one hospital, etc for a while."
HealthInsurance,"Under most insurance policies, ER visits must now be treated as ""in network"" under ACA federal law. Definitely insist everything be submitted to insurance first. Then ask the hospital for a copy of its Financial Assistance Policy. Many hospitals will forgive or write off or discount all or part of the bill depending on your income, even if you do have insurance."
HealthInsurance,Just you? No wife and kids or anything?
HealthInsurance,Just me
HealthInsurance,"It appears that Ambetter is accepted by most/all locations of these hospital systems in Indiana: IU Health, St. Vincent (Ascension) Health, Franciscan Health, Community (Central Indiana). (Note Community refers to a specific brand of hospitals whose website is ecommunity.com, not the general idea of all ""community"" hospitals.)
It appears that several (but not all) of the hospital employed physicians who work for those hospital systems are also in network with Ambetter. So I would look for a clinic affiliated with one of these hospitals (some of the hospitals even have primary care clinics or offices inside their hospitals), and then call up and ask them if they would accept a new patient with Ambetter insurance. 
Regarding urgent care, Ambetter is accepted at CVS MinuteClinics, Med Express, and Concentra urgent care clinics. Again, I'd just pick one and suggest calling first to make sure they take Ambetter new patients.

If you are in Central Indiana, you might also like the website zocdoc.com which allows you to pick what kind of insurance you have, and then it will show you doctors that are accepting your insurance, accepting new patients, and allows you to sign up for an appointment on the spot. There are also patient reviews shown to help you select a doctor."
HealthInsurance,"When billing his number will be 01, yours will be 02 and so on"
HealthInsurance,Uhccp does offer short term plans as well. Given that op mentioned getting something in the mail leads me to believe that it's a solicitation for short term insurance.
HealthInsurance,"I've seen several pieces of mail regarding the UHC community plan.  It's for dual eligible, Medicare/Medicaid.  I'm under 65 and not Medicaid eligible, but still received the mailings.  I think they are just doing a mass mailing campaign right now.  "
HealthInsurance,"To be honest, like most employer-based healthcare, it's as good as your employer is willing to pay for it.

without any additional details, all I can say with certainty is that Cigna's OAP is basically the same as a PPO, but with a few tweaks, primarily to their contract w/ healthcare providers.  You'll likely have in and out of network benefits, but all the details from there are based on your specific employer's plan.

that said, OAP's (without the Choice Fund HRA/HSA options) are typically co-pay based plans with reasonable deductibles ($500 - $1000.) if that's what you're getting for $40/mo, then your employer is quite generous.   


source: worked almost 10 years at Cigna."
HealthInsurance,They said 90% will be covered? What does that mean
HealthInsurance,"You can get catastrophic coverage as you’re under 30. At 50k and single you’re probably not eligible for any subsidies. "
HealthInsurance,"Call the hospital billing department and explain you’re a student. Ask what financial assistance they offer, if any. Often they will help you some since they’d rather get half the bill then never get any of it and let it go to collections.

Do the same for the ambulance company.

Be very polite and courteous and emphasize you’re a student that doesn’t make a lot and this happened when your family really couldn’t afford it. Have your insurance info, any bill statements, and any medical paperwork or discharge instructions handy in case they need specific codes for things. "
HealthInsurance,Can you post the summary of benefits and coverage? It looks like [this](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/149308/file-18060187-jpg/images/summary_of_benefits_and_coverage_sbc.jpg)
HealthInsurance,"that means you have 90% coinsurance (ins pays 90%, you pay 10%) - that's not bad.  there likely is also a deductible that you would end up liable before that 90% kicks in.  that's what you need to find out.

Like /u/daneslord sald, if you could post the summary of benefts and coverage, we could make more sense of it for you."
HealthInsurance,"generally, medcaid members are protected from balance biling (a medical provider turning around and billing the patient for anything not paid by insurance).  Have you verified with the ambulance company that they are aware that you had medicaid at the time of service?  Have you tried contacting the appeals and grievances dept of your medicaid provider about this?  Or contacting the state dept of health (whoever is in charge of medicaid)??"
HealthInsurance,"~~An out of state provider is not bound to any agreement with OP’s state Medicaid and can bill him. Last I checked, CMS frowns on the practice but has no ability to do anything about it.~~

ETA: I am a maroon, thought OP was talking about out of state services, not just OON."
HealthInsurance,"What sarajustme said.  Call the phone number on the bills and explain that you have Medicaid.  ""Balance billing"" is the magic word, providers are not allowed to do this with Medicaid patients.

Not all providers accept Medicaid, so you can sometimes run into trouble with follow-up care when you actually have the option of choosing which doctor you see.  But for actual, emergency care, you should have no balance due."
HealthInsurance,"I'm late to the party, but you can search for federally funded health centers using [this tool](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/).  These facilities all welcome Medicaid patients (just stick within your state of residence)."
HealthInsurance," Yes.  All health insurance is local.
So, what is your insurance situation? Through your employer? Self employed?"
HealthInsurance,"In theory, yes. In real world, could cause issues such as dual enrollment, who bills which insurance, what shows up when they run your insurance, etc.  paying twice for coverage, one being marketplace and other being your possible short term.

I totally get the peace of mind. I would start by calling your existing insurance company and have a discussion about your medical concerns about being listed as tobacco user, run what if situations by them and then write it down. 

After that’s see how you feel. If your still set on getting a short term policy, then you already know what you are looking for vs what you have.

Still have 10 months to go in 2018.  Don’t know if that’s “short term” by insurance standards. 

IMO, I would find out what my situation was with current insurance, see how I feel about it if something were to happen. See what I’m looking at coverage and cost wise.  Then I would know right where I stood from that point.  I would then take a bit, think it over and see how I feel about the updated situation. If I still felt like I needed the short term, I would start shopping around, as I now know what my existing coverage is and does vs what my expectations could be. Thus filling in gaps for peace of mind. 



Information is power !  "
HealthInsurance,"I just called and asked them if tobacco related illnesses would be covered under the policy as written and the rep gave me a firm no. "
HealthInsurance,"It's just when I search on google, it doesn't specifically tell me about the term ""immigration document Id"". I could call them up for specific but they're closed now sigh...."
HealthInsurance,"You would download the appropriate form from your link, print it out, fill it out and mail it to the marketplace. They take it and if approved send the exemption information needed to fill out your taxes.


They issue an exemption certificate number or ECN.  You put this code on your taxes with IRS form, or thro tax filing software. 


Applying :[applying for exemption ](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-coverage-exemptions/apply-for-exemption/) 



How you’ll find out if you qualify for an exemption:

The Health Insurance Marketplace will mail you a notice with your exemption eligibility result.






How to claim an exemption you qualify for:

If you qualify for an exemption, the notice you get from the Marketplace will include your unique Exemption Certificate Number (ECN).
You’ll use your ECN when you file your federal taxes for the year you don’t have coverage. You’ll use it to complete IRS Form 8965—Health Coverage Exemptions. Each member of your household who qualifies for an exemption will get their own ECN.
"
HealthInsurance,"And now you know.  Sorry about that. 

I would guess you are going to start shopping for short term or another insurance.
This can get complicated as stated earlier and it’s on edges of my expertise.  


Hopefully you can find something that works for you!


"
HealthInsurance,"Right -- I don't think that's an actual term, they're just using it as a catch-all for the number they need from all different immigration documents. Which is obnoxious. My guess is it's the A-number, but I wouldn't be shocked if it was the card number instead."
HealthInsurance,"ugh I guess I'll just have to wait until next Monday to call them up and ask before applying huh? Thank god they got rid of the individual mandate so I won't have to deal with penalty of not having an insurance. But won't this law skyrocket the monthly premium when I'm no longer eligible for medicaid other than regular insurance? "
HealthInsurance,"Perhaps you misspelled ""hug."" Would you like one? ��

HealthInsurance,"let's keep this simple: 

you are responsible for charges up to your deductible amount. After that, your plan is paying something. You haven't said what portion of something that might be. 

Your out-of-pocket limit is the maximum annual amount you pay for covered charges. Your plan pays 100% of covered charges after that.


For more detailed responses here, post a de-identified copy of your *Summary of Benefits and Coverage*. [It looks like this] (https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf)- your plan is obliged to provide it to you."
HealthInsurance,"Um....just so you know, they got rid of the mandate.  Starting in the 2019 tax season. There's still one for 2018.  And as for your alien  number, use the one on your green card.  Or your TIN."
HealthInsurance,"Copays don't count to deductibles.

Some insurances don't count MRIs and scans in their covered services. You have to read your insurance policy for that. Some insurances don't cover specialists.

Premiums keep your insurance active. It doesn't count towards deductibles. "
HealthInsurance,"so what does count towards deductibles?

thanks for responding!"
HealthInsurance,"Copays can be good or bad. Copays for doctors offices could be 30$ a visit, 50$ for specialist visit. That could be good if you did a gazillion things. Could be bad if the things they do are not covered or they did nothing just saw you 2 minutes. You still pay the copay.

Copays for drugs could be good or bad. You could pay 10$ for all generics including ibuprofen or could be something expensive like HIV generic that is 1000$ but you just pay 10$. "
HealthInsurance,so it takes effect starting 2019? So am I going to have to face penalty although I'm waiting for eligibility? (I mean I'm going to apply directly to medicaid but that application from marketplace is being transferred to department as of now)...
HealthInsurance,"thank you - i edited the post to include this link:

HealthInsurance,"sorry - this looks more like that:

http://www.bcbsfl.com/DocumentLibrary/SBC/2018/1807.pdf

thank you!"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, probably easiest to wait till Monday. The individual mandate is actually still in effect for this year, but you should qualify for an exemption because of your low income. And actually as long as your income is below $50,000 or so your insurance costs won't go up even with mandate repeal, because the financial help you would get from the government goes up just as much as the overall premium increase."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,Your surgery is not a doctor office visit. It's a surgery. That would count
HealthInsurance,"*Now* we're cooking with gas ;-)

s'ok - after you meet your $5,200 deductible, YOU pay $280 - which is 20% of the remainder of  the total of the treatment charges you've laid out in your post. Altogether, that's $5,200 + 280 = $5,480.

So you would still not be at your annual out-of-pocket cap (""OOP""). You'd need to incur another $7,000+ of covered  charges to hit the OOP (doing the math at the end of a long week, no warrantee on these figures).

Your plan applies $350 copay for MRIs - so that figure probably is NOT included in computation of your deductible (adjust your figures as necessary). On the other hand, your copays WOULD ordinarily count towards meeting your OOP. Your plan lists only these things as NOT being included in the OOP: 

&gt;What is not included in the out-of-pocket limit? Premium, balance-billed charges,and health care this plan doesn'tcover

hooray! No mention of copays there


"
HealthInsurance,"lemme make sure I understand this correctly.

my surgery cost: 5,200
facility cost: 1,400

after I pay the 5,200 surgery cost, I should only owe 280  (20%) of the 1,400 facility cost? or would I pay the whole thing because of my out of pocket limit?

I swear I have a brain - for some reason, it's so difficult for me to wrap my head around insurance. I should have prefaced this with ""explain it to me like i'm 5"". thank you for taking the time to look at everything."
HealthInsurance,"if you qualify for medicaid, the penalty is waived as of your application.  Or if your income is low enough, you get a waiver.

And yes, all of this is awful, and if you don't work in the industry, you'd never understand it.  Welcome to the frustration that is this subreddit.  "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I should only owe 280 (20%) of the 1,400 facility cost

this. You'll only owe more for covered charges if, y'know, you incur *more* covered charges.
"
HealthInsurance,"So here's how I understand it. A deductible is what you pay before your insurance will start paying for anything. A copay is a set dollar amount that you pay every time you do something (doctor visit, fill a prescription, etc) that unfortunately does not count towards the deductible. Once you meet your deductible you only have to pay copays or coinsurance (like a copay but a % instead of a fixed dollar amount). And once your deductible, copays, and coinsurance meet your out of pocket max for the year, your insurance pays for everything, and you only need to pay your premium. 

If you didn't have insurance, your surgery would have likely cost you a lot more than $5200. You are paying $550/mo so that you only have to pay $5200 + coinsurance, and up to a max of $6900, for medical procedures, which should technically be a deal. A plan like yours I think would only be worth it if that surgery would have been extremely expensive without it, bc right now you're paying a very high premium and a high deductible and only just barely getting past your max OOP limit (or are just under it? sorry I wasn't quite sure after reading the comments). 

Normally plans will have low deductibles and high premiums, or vice versa... but yours seems to have both. I'm in CA and I feel like our insurance is expensive, but through Covered CA (our obamacare) I was able to find a $0 deductible plan for $350/mo, and copays are $10-$20. Maybe there's something I'm missing here, or maybe FL is just terrible, but I would def shop around next during open enrollment. 

edit: I see your plan is a PPO, mine is an HMO which could explain the price difference. If you're going through the trouble of getting in network care anyways, maybe switch to an HMO next year? "
HealthInsurance,"The items on your plan that say 20% after deductible count towards the deductible.  Items that say co-pay do not count.

Here is an example.  I recently went to see a dermatologist.  The dermatologist office visit was a $50 co-pay for the office visit to a specialist.  So I had to pay the $50.  While there the dermatologist found a mole that had to be removed and tested.  The fee for removing the mole was not included in the basic office visit and they charged $100.  Then they sent them to be tested and the test ran $60.

So here is the rundown of my expenses for the visit:

1.  Office visit (basic exam) $50 copayment - does not apply to deductible

2.  Procedure to remove mole $100 - does apply to deductible

3.  Lab testing of mole - $60 - does apply to deductible

The costs that apply to the deducible I had to pay 100% of since I hadn't met the deductible yet.  If I had I only would have had to pay the 20% co-insurance.

All of these items counted towards to out of pocket maximum.  If I had already reached my out of pocket maximum then I wouldn't have had to pay anything at all.

Of course all the rules change if you go out of network.

Hope this helps.

To me the most confusing part of figuring out the cost is what services are included in a basic office visit co-pay.  For example when going to the dermatologist I had thought that the $50 co-pay for the specialist would be my entire cost.  That ended up not being the case as that fee only covered the basic exam (i.e. him looking at my skin).  Anything he found that needed to be treated was an extra cost for the treatment as that billable under a different code even if it took him one minute.

Another example is if you go to a specialist and they tell you that you need an x-ray.  The specialist fee is a set co-pay, but they'll charge you an additional cost for the x-ray (that is a deductible type item) and another fee for a radiologist to read the x-ray (also a deductible type item).   "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks.
I was reading turbotax forums about this and they say that you don't need to have to have ECN to apply for an exemption on your taxes."
HealthInsurance,"wow, that helped a lot. thank you so much. i am bummed that the two MRIs I had each had a $350 copay.


I am a relatively healthy person on cheap prescriptions - I have some pain that is being explored. while exploring that, they discovered neuropathy in my left arm that isn’t related but needs surgery. I understand if you can’t answer this - but am I on the wrong plan in your opinion? $520 a month with a deductible of $5,200 and out of pocket limit of $6,000 and some change? I know I am lucky this is happening in February and not November, and they said we could set up a payment plan - so I am thankful for that and am feeling less overwhelmed about what I can’t change. but dang, it’s so much money. :("
HealthInsurance,"True, to a degree. If I recall correctly, some tax software files for the exemption for you, with the IRS form.  Then you basically get told down the line if it’s approved or denied.   

The ECN comes once you get approved for an exemption.  So you probably could file for one and should be somewhere in the software that lets you tell them “ hey I applied for one” etc."
HealthInsurance,"The rates all depend on your age and location.   I'm a little older and I pay about $850/month with a $7000 deductible and slightly higher max out of pocket.   I could buy lower deductibles but the math I did suggest that it isn't worth it unless I were to blow through more than about $5K of expenses and I typically don't do more than about $3K.

This country's medical system is totally screwed up.

Question:  are you insured through work or do you buy your own individual plan through the marketplace or direct from an insurance company.   If you buy through work then you're likely only paying for a percentage of the cost.  $520 sounds great to me but then I'm around 60."
HealthInsurance,"A $350 co-pay for an MRI isn't bad.  I think on my last plan tests like an MRI wouldn't have a co-pay. Instead they were part of the deductible and I think they cost a whole lot more than $350.  I'm not sure of that though since the only types of MRI's I've had were a more complex type which I think cost a couple thousand.

One more point:  Sounds like your surgery and other expenses will take you over the out of pocket max.   If so then it's still early in the year.  So this would be the year to catch up on any medical needs you might have been putting off or might not have been sure if you needed yet.  Expensive tests, dermatologist exam, orthopedics for your feet (if covered under your plan), etc."
HealthInsurance,"I also found this
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i8965.pdf#page=3

It seems like you can only get ECN for a year in advance, not for the past year. I tried to fill in form from healthcare.gov and it says that I should use 8965 for past year. "
HealthInsurance,"i’m 30 and buy it through directly from company. it is totally screwed up. ��

[Individual Shared Responsibility Provision – Exemptions: Claiming or Reporting](https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/individuals-and-families/aca-individual-shared-responsibility-provision-exemptions0

**Marketplace Exemptions must be granted in advance and reported when you file your return**

While you can claim most exemptions from coverage when you file your tax return, certain exemptions must be granted by the Health Insurance Marketplace in advance. This includes coverage exemptions for certain hardship situations and for members of certain religious sects. 

If you can claim the coverage exemption on your tax return, you do not need to apply for a Marketplace-granted exemption.

If the Marketplace grants your coverage exemption, they will send you a notice with your unique Exemption Certificate Number or ECN. Keep this notice with other important tax information. 

When you file your tax return, enter your ECN on Form 8965 in column C of Part I, Marketplace-Granted Coverage Exemptions for Individuals.

*If the Marketplace hasn’t processed your exemption application before you file your tax return, complete Part I of Form 8965 and enter “pending” in Column C for each person listed.*

You’ll submit one Form 8965 with your return and use separate lines for each individual and exemption type claimed on the return. Form 8965 can be filed electronically with your tax return.







---- 

You would still need to fill out the application for one, mark it as pending in tax software, and hope your approved. Otherwise you will owe the IRS money for not having health coverage.
You submitted a few posts, back about 5 months ago asking very similar questions about the penalties and some good information was provided to you.
At this point, your situation is getting beyond internet forum help. I highly suggest sitting down face to face with tax agent, to go over your taxes, filing, and situation with health coverage. 
In the next year( the one we are in 2018) get a jump on any exemptions you might qualify for. The fee for not having health coverage still is in effective till 2019. Which means this is the last year, 2018, they will have the fee.
"
HealthInsurance,"You should see if there are updated summaries. The first one you link is an SBC from a 2016 plan and is in the wrong format.  The other summary is from a 2017 plan year. 

Who knows how many small things and how the cost shares have changed in those two years.  Even the same plan will have small changes and different costs from year to year."
HealthInsurance,"This is just what my employer gave me "
HealthInsurance,Will mostly depend on how much you will have to pay for each plan in premiums vs how much you will use the plan. The 2000/20% has a lower out of pocket which means you will pay less if you max out your plan but will probably cost more in premiums.
HealthInsurance,"do state marketplace plans overlap with other states:
-No most do not. Check with your existing state you reside in, they can tell you yes, or no.  Most times, plans are valid for only that state. If moving to a new state you would have to re-apply with that state.

If not, which state do I go through for insurance:
- Whatever state your currently living and residing in. If your in Colorado, you would apply for that state. Move to another state, re-apply there.

As for a move, this is directly from the marketplace, ie Healthcare.gov

[life change event](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/)



&gt;A move is considered a life change event, but you have to have qualifying health insurance before you moved.
&gt; Changes in residence

&gt;Household moves that qualify you for a Special Enrollment Period:

   &gt; Moving to a new home in a new ZIP code or county
   &gt; Moving to the U.S. from a foreign country or United States territory
   &gt; A student moving to or from the place they attend school
   &gt; A seasonal worker moving to or from the place they both live and work
   &gt; Moving to or from a shelter or other transitional housing

&gt;Note: Moving only for medical treatment or staying somewhere for vacation doesn’t qualify you for an SEP.

&gt;Important: **You must prove you had qualifying health coverage for one or more days during the 60 days before your move. **You don’t need to provide proof if you’re moving from a foreign country or United States territory.




If this is thro healthcare.gov this applies, now if your going thro each state for Medicaid or state based aid, you will need to research each states requirements and application turn around time to get valid coverage thro out your moves. You dont want any gaps in your coverage if you can help it.



"
HealthInsurance,My office is covering 100% of the premium so I just have to do Copays
HealthInsurance,"Yes she can. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I'm curious if anyone knows if moving qualifies as a life event 

Sure. But how big a move is it - around the block, to the other end of your state, across the country? Are you leaving your plan's service area (which may be as small as your county and maybe one or more of the surrounding counties)?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Should my wife be able to terminate her COBRA policy (in NY state) since that state exchange is still open?

HealthInsurance,"Thanks! We’ll move quickly. You’ve answered it, but I should have stated my question more clearly: since the existence of COBRA policies is directed by federal law, does the federal or the state open enrollment period apply for them?"
HealthInsurance,"The two (COBRA and NYS's open enrollmen period) are not connected. Your wife's ability to drop COBRA is not determined by *ANY* state's ACA enrollment process. In fact, she can drop COBRA any old time she wants, just as anyone with COBRA coverage can. 


Your state's enrollment window dates determine whether dropping COBRA makes sense. In your wife's case, based on what you've told us, it sure seems to."
HealthInsurance,"Broker's are paid commissions through the insurance companies, not by you. Will make no difference at all."
HealthInsurance,"Also unless you have a qualifying life event, like a new baby or move/divorce, the enrollment window is closed for the ACA. You may have to grab a private plan through any number of insurance companies"

If so, that basically means there's no financial benefit to using one over the other? It seems from my google-fu that the main difference is there being more options off the exchange? If I have that right, I think a broker would be the best choice for us.

Thanks :) "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; not if it'll cost me twice as much.

As another poster noted,  you're paying for a broker's services - if insurers in your state are paying commissions on marketplace policy sales  - whether or not you actually use a broker. Commissions are 'baked in' to premium rates. If insurers have stopped paying commissions on marketplace plans - they have in CT - then a broker who helps you with marketplace coverage is looking to earn some dough by selling you other stuff - disability or life insurance coverage, or critical illness insurance, etc. They may tell you otherwise - don't believe it. Ask anyone you're considering using explicitly how they are paid. If they don't tell you, clearly and simply, find someone else to do business with."

Everything I have researched has told me quitting does not qualify you for ACA, but if you have sources on the contrary can you please DM or post here? The only reason he hasn’t quit at this point is because of insurance.  Curious to know what you found.  We are located in NJ, just in case that makes any difference. "
HealthInsurance,"[Here's a link to the .gov site,](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/) just scroll down to ""loss of health insurance"" then ""losing job-based coverage.""

In PA there are plans through insurance companies that are available off the exchange which aren’t available on the exchange. These are the same companies that are offering plans on the exchange. It gets confusing. Try and find an experienced broker Who doesn’t seem like a salesman to help you lead the way. The healthcare.gov call centers usually don’t give you any good advice because they are not licensed agents/brokers. 

Also, remember the subsidies go off of your net income fo 2018. If your husband is starting a business and loses money the first couple years it is possible you could get a subsidy. It is really tricky with this because you need to predict what you’re going to make for 2018 not what you made for 2017. I tell all my clients if there is any chance that your income will be below the threshold that allows you to get a subsidy you should consider going through the marketplace.

Google the subsidy Calculator and go to the first link. It is a Henry J Kaiser subsidy Calculator. This calculator coincides with the healthcare.gov subsidies to the penny. You can see what incomes qualify for subsidies and what don’t full around with the numbers. You can also go to healthcare.gov/see-plans to see what options are available.

I apologize for any typos I am doing this on my phone."
HealthInsurance,"You don't need to.  You can submit an application saying that your coverage has ended.  They'll ask for documentation, but it will go into effect before then.  Should take effect Feb 1 if you apply before the 15th."
HealthInsurance,Excellent advice.  Follow this.
HealthInsurance,"Ok, who were you receiving this care from?  Is it medicaid?  If so, you must report a change in income.  Depending on the state, you can be greylisted (not a black list, it's complicated) from future benefits from the state (social welfare programs)
"
HealthInsurance,"Hi.  Yes, moving is a qualifying event.  Moving to a different city is easier to get approved.  

Re: moving to a different country; yes that makes you exempt.  Just be sure that you have some sort of health safety net there (and that you qualify for it)"
HealthInsurance,"Just to add on to what everyone has said...is this plan HSA compatible?  If so, google HSA.  They're pretty awesome."
HealthInsurance,"I showed my husband the thread and we're definitely going to see a broker. That's what I would suggest for you too, because that's probably the best way to ensure you get accurate info for your specific location and circumstance. Idk much about it but I assume they wouldn't charge you to sit down and go through your options. 

I can't imagine they'd exclude quitting because of our exact situations, it would discourage people from starting business, and the SBA would probably be raising hell over it. "
HealthInsurance,"I should've worded my post differently! I didn't mean I thought a broker would rip me off or charge a crazy amount, I misunderstood how this entire process worked and thought all plans on the exchange were discounted in some way over private plans. That's why I thought it would cost more lol 

Our financial situation is weird. We went from poor to not quickly and we can say with reasonable certainty that we won't qualify. We have an appt with a tax guy to help us figure out our income and everything. 

Now that we have somewhat of an idea how this works, we're definitely going to use a broker. Thanks so much for your help :) "
HealthInsurance,No.
HealthInsurance,"Unless you live in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, NY, Washington, or DC, open enrollment has ended for 2018.  If you were previously diagnosed with ADHD, your treatment most likely will not be covered by a short term medical plan.  

"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Everything I have researched has told me quitting does not qualify you for ACA

Leaving your job...whether being fired or quitting it...is a qualifying life event if you are losing health care coverage.  "
HealthInsurance,"Can you elaborate? I was under the impression that COBRA had some restrictions about when you could terminate it. At least that's how I read this chart (which is specifically about job loss triggering COBRA, while my wife was aged off her parents' plan - not sure that matters):

https://www.healthcare.gov/unemployed/cobra-coverage/"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Obamacare *is* private insurance.  The only real health insurance plans that are going to be available to you now are short term medical plans that don't cover pre-existing conditions such as your ADHD.  "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Would you mind explaining why? I was under the impression that if you paid more than 9% of your income through work you could still get a subsidy? "
HealthInsurance,"There are no subsidies for insurance except insurance obtained through the marketplace. The 9.69% number you mention is the threshold for ""affordable"" insurance. If your insurance through your employer isn't affordable (more than 9.69% of MAGI), you can go to the exchange instead for insurance and possibly qualify for a subsidy."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;The healthcare.gov call centers usually don’t give you any good advice because they are not licensed agents/brokers. 


Not always true, but not always not, either....��
"
HealthInsurance,"Right on. Appreciate it. "
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, that chart's...not the best.


You can't drop COBRA  **and enroll in New ACA coverage** any old time.

You CAN drop COBRA and enroll in ACA coverage *if you happen to be in an open enrollment period*, as it looks like your wife is.

Confirm with NYState of Health staff."
HealthInsurance,"No subsidy for work insurance.  The law says that if individual coverage through work costs more than 9%ish of your income, then you can purchase insurance through the exchange and qualify for a subsidy if your income is below 400% of the federal poverty level."
HealthInsurance,"Call the insurance company. Ask them about the payments and what they have on file. Once you have the full story, cancel the auto payment with them. You don’t want some random payment showing up on your credit report.  They will try to transfer you to the marketplace, ie healthcare.gov.  Do not let them until you get as much information as possible. 


One of two things happened from what you have described:

1.  Plan was valid, payments were made, and your card used was stolen. They will continue to charge the card. Speak to insurance company about issues. If it was for your 2017 plan,  they are the only ones to help at this point.

2. You neglected to contact the insurance company about losing access to that card. Call them and see where they stand.  If it’s the same company your with in 2018, they could bill you for any past due amounts before letting your 2018 coverage be useable.

Even if you didn’t use it, doesn’t have any effect on anything.  To draw vague circles, it’s like car insurance, a lot of people have it, never use it. Doesn’t mean they don’t pay for it.  ( I use that analogy loosely)


 Call the insurance company now. "
HealthInsurance,"Moving by itself may not grant a special enrollment period.  You would have to have had qualifying health coverage for 60 days before your move. They will ask for documention of move, and coverage.

It’s a system of checks and balances to prevent people from circumventing the way it’s supposed to work.  


As for the out of country, go on the website and search for exemptions, it will ask you various questions, one being were you outside the United States?  It will then show you what exactly you need to do to apply for the exemption and all the steps involved."
HealthInsurance,Thank you! Showing this to the husband this evening ��
HealthInsurance,Thank you - I just found out he was told by a friend who works in HR (not at his job) that quitting does not qualify.  Relieved to know that’s not the case!
HealthInsurance,No buts its about 50k a year I imagine that disqualifies me...I was making about 8k a year before.
HealthInsurance,"Yeah its Medicaid I think...its a site called healthnet I'm not sure how all of it works honestly nor do I know if I still have it, I will definitely call and cancel, thanks."
HealthInsurance,"I'm currently on Kaiser in CA. which has presence in a couple other states. But not the state we would be moving to
"
HealthInsurance,"Moved it up $900 to a $4500 deductible to lower the premium. Max out of pocket is $6650. I’ve never had a plan where there isn’t a copay. Is this normal? "
HealthInsurance,"Yes, you must pay. Odds are they will send you to collections if you don’t."
HealthInsurance,Thanks for your help!
HealthInsurance,"Thanks so much for your reply, makes me feel a bit better about what to expect and look for in the future. Will definitely look into companies with better health insurance options, and I'll go with paying a bit extra to save more in the long run. Thanks again."
HealthInsurance,"It is entirely up to your therapist as to the amount, frequency, and length of your appointments that are medically appropriate for your condition."
HealthInsurance,"You may get a check back, depending upon how it all washes out. It will be up to you to pursue a refund for excess payment to one provider or another.  They might kick out a check without you asking for it, but I doubt it.  And it might be a lot of trouble on your part to get a refund assuming you're entitled to one.

You would only need to put that $ back into your HSA if the total HSA distributions for the year exceed your total out-of-pocket expenses for the year.  And if that happens, you don't necessarily have to do it.  But distributions in excess of your expenses are subject to additional taxes and/or penalties.  I don't know exactly how that all works.  That's more IRS/accountant territory."
HealthInsurance,"I had a similar situation. My deductible was 2k and had to have an MRI one week with endoscopy/colonoscopy then next week. 

MRI place said they would bill me. I had to pay up front for the other procedures because it wasn’t showing I met any of my deductible yet.

I paid up front and kept an eye on my claims. As soon as I saw the EOB from my insurance stating that I paid almost $300 more for my second weeks tests than I needed to. I called the place that did the endoscopy and they were able to re process it and send me a refund for the $300. 

Also when I finally got the bill for the mri, I noticed they charged for something insurance didn’t cover. The billing center was able to remove that charge for me, it was only $60 but hey anything helps.

Definitely keep an eye on your EOB and ask it to be re processed if the amount paid is different from the EOB."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;If my co-pay if $5 for primary and $15 for urgent care, should I just go see urgent care most of the time?

kind of a strange title, because at first glance it seems your *better* move is seeing your primary care doctor for $5, vs UC clinician for $15.

Big picture, if you've got a plan that sets your PCP copay at $5, you've got 1st world problems ;-)

But I DO see your ""value logic"", and I ESPECIALLY like your valuation of convenience/easy access/no appointment needed for UC. (full disclosure: I have a business relationship with a walk-in clinics locator application)"
HealthInsurance,"My feeling is your account would be easier to follow if you used numbers rather than narrative about your transactions.

Have you paid the ENTIRE charge for your upcoming procedure prospectively? If so, a) WHY would you do that b) any insurer indemnification is yours, up to the amount of the bill. If the hospital/your clinician(s) are jacking around with the bill AFTER you've paid, that's on them, not you.


An aside: this kind of thing:

&gt;Due to hdhp, the hospital required that I pay for it in advance

drives me insane. You've provided  info re: your health coverage, hospital's confirmed it, if I'm you I NEVER pay them more than some kind of ""deposit"", a fraction of my deductible amount, before the procedure - or at least the facility/clinician's business staff &amp; I have a tense conversation about who gets paid what when."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; You would only need to put that $ back into your HSA if the total HSA distributions for the year exceed your total out-of-pocket expenses for the year. 

Of course [IRS publication 969 is silent on the whole ""putting overpayments back"" thing](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969#en_US_2016_publink1000204088). Are HSA adminstrators *obliged* to accommodate  accountholders who want to put distributions back? Feels like they *should* be, given that IRS will slap a 20% penalty tax on ""excess"" distributions not used to pay qualifying treatment bills.
"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; It is entirely up to your therapist

which in the end means, to the patient, ""if you're a capable negotiator, you may be able to persuade your therapist of the potential efficacy of longer sessions - but understand that they may only pursue that change if it's efficacious for them as well as for you"""
HealthInsurance,"I am unsure of the full cost of the procedure. Online estimates provided by insurance company indicate the high estimate is $12,906. Based on the math of what I paid form the HSA, my procedure is on the higher side.
  
I have a 4k deductible, then 80/20 coinsurance to an individual out of pocket maxium of 6,850.00.

I have 1,803 remaining on my deductible. I was required to pay 4300 from my HSA (accurate number unavailable, site is down). 

&gt;Have you paid the ENTIRE charge for your upcoming procedure prospectively? If so, a) WHY would you do that

When I called to schedule a test earlier in the year for this diagnosis, same hospital, they said and I quote ""will you be paying for this via credit card or financing today?"" prior to forwarding me to appt scheduling. Partial payment was not an option then, so no, I did not ask whether partial payment would be an option now."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;now they are on the hook for paying back the subsidies due to vastly underestimating their own income as well as not factoring in my modest increase

hmmm. Pretty sure if you were claimed as your parents dependent for tax purposes, your income wouldn't factor into calculation of your parents' subsidy eligibility. 


But never mind that;  the question is whether your parents can drop you now, absent a special enrollment event.

I'm not seeing it.

But here's a thought; if you apply for Medicaid coverage, &amp; are turned down, that *might* qualify you for a special enrollment event ([see healthcare.gov screener checklist items](https://www.healthcare.gov/screener/marketplace.html))"
HealthInsurance,"Right - so you did NOT pay the full amount of the prospective bill - but you DID pay a good-sized portion, maybe all, of what your out-of-pocket expenses might be for this procedure.

 Here's my calculations: 

- ~13k bill -1,800 your remaining 2018 deductible = $11.2k;
- 20% of that amount is $2.2k;
- 1.8 + 2.2 = $4k = amount you've paid so far

&gt; Partial payment was not an option then

were you going to be operated on that day? If not, then partial payment is/was ALWAYS an option. Billing office staff aren't the persons to be paid - the persons/institutions providing you care. They're billing office staff. Lesson for future; politely, but firmly, explain to them what you'll pay that day - if anything. Have them have your treatment providers contact you if there are any further concerns about payment. *If you eventually end up in the same spot* - them insisting on you paying all that dough up front - you've lost nothing. If they in fact yield in the face of reason - after all, you can be sure they aren't collecting payments in full of deductibles/copays up front from all of their *other* patients/customers - and permit you to pay some amount lower than the calculated deductible/copay, you ""win"" the cash flow battle for that day."
HealthInsurance,Well put.
HealthInsurance,Yes.
HealthInsurance,"Ok, so all is not completely lost.

They changed carriers (insurers are ""carriers"", and doctors and hospitals are ""providers"" just fyi), but did they send you the paperwork.  They are required to send you the form; how did they do it?  Ask them for details.  

And I'm curious as to why you'd have to decline coverage if they already said you're not enrolled?  Ask for clarification.  In the meantime, ask them for an appeal form; this ""stops the clock"" as to your being late.  

Something isn't quite right here."
HealthInsurance,"Depending on how your plan is structured; one copay for urgent care might be the better option.  "
HealthInsurance,"They mass-emailed all employees at the company the open enrollment packet on the afternoon of 1-23-2018. 

It read: 
Good Morning,

REMINDER: Open Enrollment is January 24-28 (Wednesday, Thursday and Friday from 8-5pm, Saturday and Sunday 8-11am)

Which seems awfully short as it is, especially to look through 36 pages of new material.

Is this the appeals form you speak of? [ https://www.healthcare.gov/marketplace-appeals/appeal-forms ]


1st EDIT: Our HR is saying there is no appeals form

2nd EDIT: HR asked if I was out of the country. I replied yes. They laughed and said that wasn't true (it wasn't) and there was nothing they could do since it's a ""government thing"".

3rd EDIT: So Obamacare enrollment has been closed, so that government option is no longer available to me. The company I work for has changed insurance providers and forced us to fill out new paperwork which were were given only a few days to comprehend, fill out and turn in and now I'm going to have to pay the maximum ""FINE"" for not having insurance, which leaves me without insurance? 

I was dreading this years taxes, but next year is going to be even more fun."
HealthInsurance,"All treatments are either medically appropriate, or they are not.  If someone is not receiving medically appropriate treatment then they are free to seek another practitioner - for any or no reason really."
HealthInsurance,"TIL: Open enrollment is not required to be a certain length of time. Most employers have an open enrollment period of at least two to four weeks. Some, just three days."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; medically appropriate

you understand of course that this is a term of art, rather than a law of physics. Bloodletting was once deemed medically appropriate (although admittedly I believe some variations of it are returning to favor)"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I'm curious as to why you'd have to decline coverage if they already said you're not enrolled? 

yeah  that's weird - they have no default to some minimum level of coverage? If their default is to NO coverage, you shouldn't/wouldn't have to decline it now, would you?

do what danes is telling you"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Our HR is saying there is no appeals form

How big is your employer? If 100+ employees, there may be no *form*, but there had g-d well better be an appeals process, spelled out in a plan document, or you can let your employer in for a hellride.

Ask HR to provide you a Summary Plan Description (SPD) - stat. That MUST have the plan's appeals process spelled out, and employer MUST provide you that document (they have a ""reasonable time"" to do so, but they should be able to get it for you promptly). If not ....&lt; makes ""cutting throat"" motion in employer's general direction&gt;.

Even if SMALLER, I'd look into whatever your state's insurance department provides in the way of online help filing an appeal with them against whatever insurer your employer has hooked up with."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;my husband found another job and so our state healthcare (through healthy Indiana plan) was canceled

that event alone wouldn't cause anything like automatic cancellation of your state-sposored  coverage.

But why worry about Indiana anyway, if you're moving to Illinois - which will provide you a special enrollment period for coverage there. You say hubby's job's coverage is ""too expensive"" - just for him, or 4 both of you? 

If - as many employers do - his employer charges relatively little to cover him, but a LOT to add you as a dependent, let hubs sign up for employer coverage &amp; you grab some marketplace coverage. You may not qualify for premium tax credits, but marketplace coverage may still be less expensive, premiumwise, than employer's options."
HealthInsurance,"The company is definitely larger than 100 employees. I have sent an email to HR requesting a copy of our Summary Plan Description.

In the meantime, how can I find out who to contact in Tennessee? it looks like our new carrier is Blue Cross Blue Shield. 

Looking through our Benefits Enrollment Guide, I believe this may actually be the SPD?  

Do you think I have any recourse in this, especially since we were all emailed the documents on the afternoon of the 23rd?"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"I do have a copy of our SPD but there is nothing about appeals mentioned. Also, after a call to Tennessee's Consumer Insurance Services, I was informed they don't deal with private employer plans and have been directed to call the US Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration at 866-444-3272"
HealthInsurance,"A little more background: our combined income made it so that we are no longer eligible for HiP insurance. We are definite not covered and haven’t been since August!
Neither of us have an insurance option available through either of our employers, and paying $500+ a month for insurance after moving out of state is not going to be feasible for the short term.

I was looking at short term indemnity plans... I know I’ll have to enroll again when we move to Illinois.  This would have to cover traveling out of state for work, too, because I know my husband will continue working for clients based on IN, IL, KY, and OH

Or should I be looking for long-term coverage through the marketplace in Illinois before we move?"
HealthInsurance,"If you change carriers, you have to elect. I'm a broker and I've done hundreds of enrollments in my life. The only time you default is if you stick with your current carrier and don't submit anything, we won't mess with your enrollment."
HealthInsurance,"I've been told I am ""SOL"" by the US Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration"
HealthInsurance,It includes an appeals process for appealing claims. I've never seen an SPD that says anything about appealing the enrollment window an employer allows their employees at open enrollment. Please cite this.
HealthInsurance,"The U.S. Department of Labor provides guidelines on what employers must cover in their SPD. This includes the plan name and IRS-assigned number, employer’s name and address, administrator’s name and contact information, grievance and appeals process, ERISA and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rights statements, and statement of collective bargaining agreements, if relevant.

This is from [ https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/pages/0807sosnin.aspx ] "
HealthInsurance,Yeah. None of that is going to get you anywhere if you missed open enrollment because you weren't paying attention. Especially since you lied about being out of the country.
HealthInsurance,"And since you're quoting SHRM, this will be relevant to you:

Under ""How long does open enrollment have to be?""

&gt;[**Open enrollment is not required to be a certain length of time.** Most employers have an open enrollment period of at least two to four weeks.](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/pages/open-enrollment-benefits-guide.aspx)"
HealthInsurance,I was paying attention. I figured I could get away with turning in the form the following Monday.
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, I posted this above."
HealthInsurance,"Ask her to reach out to your broker to ask for an exception request to have you added. "
HealthInsurance,"feels like you missed something hubby's obtaining a job. What's your approximate annual household income? merely obtaining a job &amp; salary wouldn't necessarily mean the end of subsidized coverage.

And when is this move to IL taking place? "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; If you change carriers, you have to elect.

if the plan's insured; employers who self-fund may not require this in a change of administrators, though seems like a good opportunity to clean up enrollment records."
HealthInsurance,"I know it’s hard to believe, but that’s what the HiP people told us and that’s what we have in writing. 
We’ll be moving in March!"
HealthInsurance,"Good call, Giggin. Appeals are for claims, and not for administrative processes generally.

At the same time, employers sponsoring plans that the employer intends to be treated as ERISA plans have to provide employees with documents, like SPDs,  that detail a variety of things about each plan's operation, including rules and processes for eligibility &amp; enrollment. Per § 2520.102-3 (Contents of summary plan description), an SPD must include, among a bunch of other things, ""The plan's requirements respecting eligibility for participation...."" which has been interpreted to mean not only the definition of who is eligible but the process(s) for enrolling whoever satisfies the definition."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Looking through our Benefits Enrollment Guide, I believe this may actually be the SPD?

 Maybe &amp; maybe not. If it is supposed to be your plan's SPD, it will say so explicitly. Further, it should include contact information for whomever makes operational &amp; administrative decisions for your plan. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;...which has been interpreted to mean not only the definition of who is eligible but the process(s) for enrolling whoever satisfies the definition.

Interpreted by who? There's nothing that mandates length of open enrollment. Unfortunately this guy is out of luck until he has a qualifying event. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; There's nothing that mandates length of open enrollment.

Agreed - *but* if the SPD is silent on enrollment processes, that's not a strong case for the employer having met their ERISA obligations, should the employee decide to make a federal case of it (a long uphill climb, to be sure)"
HealthInsurance,"feels like

&gt;local birth center

needs to take the bull by the horns here if they want to be paid. THEY provided the care/treatment - THEY need to engage the insurer to get this straightened out."
HealthInsurance,"I'm trying to figure out where you're getting this information from. Have you ever done anything that you're talking about? Have you ever seen an SPD that details enrollment periods? I have never. "
HealthInsurance,"One illness can set you back hundreds of thousands which beats the *hell*  out of four thousand.   
Well worth $122 a month IMO.   

Your call.   
But browse through /r/personalfinance and read over and over about people whose financial futures have been ruined by unexpected medical bills."
HealthInsurance,"Well, I wish that was the case. Long story short, the way it’s handled with birth centers near me at least is that you pay them upfront. Then in the end you submit the claim with the paperwork they provide to be reimbursed. They are all out of network too, so without the code the insurance can do the calculations I suppose to find out what the amount they cover. I know I’m in a bad spot, but I thought someone who knows codes could shed some light to help me speed the process along. "
HealthInsurance,"I'm not in it.  I just thought it was funny and somewhat pertinent.  

Also, you know better than to report a mod's posting as spam.  ;-p"
HealthInsurance,Thank you so much for the help! I think I figurered it out! We live in Massachusetts and Blue Cross is through my dad's old employer and it covers 5 people including himself. Based on my parents tax return and income is what makes it $264! So it's normal for our family. I got in touch with a Medicaire representative! I've learned a lot today thank you for your help!
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Based on my parents tax return and income is what makes it $264!

*Now* you're cooking. That clears up a lot of questions"
HealthInsurance,"Once the coverage from the job ends, your family should be eligible for COBRA coverage for up to 36 months if his employer employ
s over 20 employees. If not, depending on the state the employer is in, there may be state continuation programs that mandate the ability for dependents to continue coverage for a period of time"
HealthInsurance,"Hiya.  Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnjGcySmT3k&amp;t=28s) video.  Then tell us where you'll be, how much you'll make, and how old you are."
HealthInsurance,"Well pretty soon it's going to be either this or join a church. "
HealthInsurance,"There's an open enrollment period every year.  You can enroll then, but outside of open enrollment, you need to have a qualifying life event to be able to sign up for health insurance.  If you don't like it, you should talk to your state level insurance regulators.  FWIW, before the ACA, it would be even harder for your to get your health insurance.  If you're in good health now, just sit tight for 9 months and don't do anything stupid like get appendicitis or cancer or an aneurysm or something else you could have prevented by being responsible and ...doing something to prevent that (/s)."
HealthInsurance,"I am assuming this is outside of the formulary (approved / covered prescriptions) for your health plan, and is in formulary for the other person.

The app Good RX lists that as a fair price in my area. 

That app also shows options of manufacturer discounts that will save you some money. 

Mods....New to this sub, so please let me me know if I crossed a line giving this advice."
HealthInsurance,Huh. Thank you anyways. Seems like a lot compared to what I've heard people get it for.
HealthInsurance,"Normally, what would happen is that you would see the oral surgeon, and then he would put in a request for pre-authorization. You do not normally do the heavy lifting on this. I will say, although health insurance might cover this, be prepared for a protracted bureaucratic process. The first request will almost always result in a denial. That's the way it is. Your provider should then appeal, and provide additional documentation. I will tell you, that different carriers have different rules on this. I know that my carrier does not ever approve this. Simply the way it is."
HealthInsurance,"You won't.

Medically necessary or not, medical plans do not cover crowns.  Does not matter the cause."
HealthInsurance,"I've seen it happen, but incredibly rarely. I don't think o p is going to have much luck."
HealthInsurance,"Are you getting the brand name medicine? That also jacks up the price. "
HealthInsurance,"The Affordable Care Act eliminated the pre-existing condition exclusion. Essentially, Insurance can no longer deny treatment for a pre-existing condition. Because of this, that would normally be nothing stopping people from not having Insurance until they actually needed it. Therefore, the government decided to eliminate anytime enrollment, and establish windows for people to buy insurance. That window has now passed."
HealthInsurance,"Hello. I'm sorry for all of your medical issues. This must be incredibly distressing for you. Did you get your Healthy Michigan card, and if so, did you give it to the hospital system where you had the operation? If they don't have the card, then they can't bill it.

Additionally, who did you choose as your plan carrier. If you chose someone like Molina, several months worth of wait is not unusual.

Edit: speech to text"
HealthInsurance,"For the most part your medical insurance is going to cover accidental dental care, not as a result of another medical condition. Your best bet is dental insurance but even then your benefit will be capped. It honestly sounds like you're in for a large OOP expense. Where did you get your insurance? Company/marketplace/parent?"
HealthInsurance,"OP, maybe you can fill us in on why now - mid-February - is when you've decided you ought to obtain health insurance, if it was *other than* a health event affectinig you,  of course."
HealthInsurance,"My insurance is from my company: Blue Cross. "
HealthInsurance,"Pharmacy benefit copay structure, PBM specific contract amounts, coverage differences in formulary. Number of reasons."
HealthInsurance,Any insight on rules with Blue Cross?
HealthInsurance,no generics for Vyvanse
HealthInsurance,Which blue cross.
HealthInsurance,"on the economics, vyvanse is not adderall; it's conservatively 8 to 10x more costly. "
HealthInsurance,Which blue cross? There are many of them
HealthInsurance,"Sorry. It's Blue Cross of Idaho. Also, I wonder if it makes any difference that my insurance company pays a great deal for my for Rheumatoid Arthritis expenses, and the GERD + dental troubles are an extension of my RA issues. "
HealthInsurance,Alright. I didn't know for sure. Was just asking. Thank you!
HealthInsurance,Ya I am. Was just wondering. Thank you!
HealthInsurance,"Your RA would always be covered by any aca compliant insurance. The treatment for Gerd would be covered.  

However, there are only like 2 companies that might cover this and bcbs id isn't one of them. I don't think this dental reconstruction is going to be covered. "
HealthInsurance,"You need to check with your health insurance pharmacy benefits manager. They should have a list of what's covered and tiers. My insurance covered it after having tried other (cheaper/generic) medications but my physician's office had to send in a prior authorization. In my case my copay for the same dose is $35 a month, and I have a coupon from their site that takes it down to $30. It sounds like you're paying close to retail."

HealthInsurance,"Hello. Thank you for your concern and response.

The hospital has my Healthy Michigan card, and I chose Blue Cross as my provider."
HealthInsurance,Good choice.  I'm assuming the hospital has your BC card as well?
HealthInsurance,"Yes, they have everything :)"
HealthInsurance,"Then what is happening is that there is a foul up somewhere between the hospital and Blue Cross. You shouldn't be calling the Medicaid office, you should be calling the number on the back of your Blue Cross card. Those are the people who will help you sort it out."
HealthInsurance,Can you provide a copy of the graphic? Numbers and slashes without what they correspond to will not allow anyone to make a suggestion.
HealthInsurance,"sure thing, just edited and added it! "
HealthInsurance,"Hiya.  You need to click on ""plan details"" for each plan, and post those as well."
HealthInsurance,"they only sent me that screenshot, then the corresponding pdfs for each plan, which don't outline that individual cost"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, you need to ask them for the plan details (summary of benefits and coverage, it looks like [this](https://ctmirror.org/files/2013/11/sample-SBC.png).)  Without that, we can't tell you anything about your plan."
HealthInsurance,"i did get that. and that part totally makes sense. what didn't make sense to me from the graphic above is what my actual monthly payment will be. which is not outlined in the summary of benefits and coverage - that only lists deductibles and my responsibility for co insurance, stuff like that. "
HealthInsurance,The company will contribute $371.27 for each plan.  So deduct that amount from each stated amount.
HealthInsurance,"how did you calculate that number, out of curiosity? "
HealthInsurance,"The company indicated that they will pay 75% of the cost of the lowest priced plan.  "
HealthInsurance,"Obviously, I don't have your plan in front of me, but I'll do my best to explain.

I'm going to make the assumption that your plan is compliant with the Healthcare Reform law. As a result, your plan will cover certain services as preventative (i.e. without any cost share to you). Such examples include: breast pump, monthly visits to GYN, measurement of fetal heart tones, etc. 

At the same time, there are other services (e.g. ultrasound, blood work, the actual delivery etc.) which may be covered, but not considered preventative under Healthcare Reform. So, the ultrasound is covered under your plan, but at the normal plan benefit (i.e. copayment, deductible, coinsurance). Pregnancy does not change how the plan covers these diagnostic tests.

The term ""covered"" in this sense is ambiguous. I'm purposely doing that to make a point.

Now, let's say you wanted to know the sex of the baby. Aetna excludes this. Determining sex is a non-covered service.

So, throughout this time, there are services covered as preventative, covered at the normal benefit, and not-covered, but may all be related to pregnancy/maternity. Pregnancy is expensive and knowing your plan limits (i.e. your deductible and out-of-pocket maximum) will help you prepare.

You mention the state-mandated hearing test. There is a good chance if your plan is through a large employer it is not following State mandates. Most policies are not required to follow state mandates. In that case, I would suggest you appeal the claim.

HealthInsurance,"I have provided more the 50% of my own support for years, so this parent has not claimed me for tax purposes for a while. "
HealthInsurance,"Okay, that should be easy to fix then. Basically your parent needs to contact his/her HSA plan administrator and see how to go about reimbursing. You will take a withdrawal from yours and use those funds to do the reimbursement. I don't know if the two HSAs can do a direct transfer or not, but they should be able to tell you how to do it.

If you do it properly there should be no tax implications."

HealthInsurance,"The hitch here may be what the Wellcare policy covers...what it means by “skilled nursing facility.”  

Most insurance plans consider “skilled needs” as relatively short-term...physical and occupational therapies after an accident/injury, prolonged IV antibiotics or wound care, or something else that would take under 100 days.    Plans cover “rehab” at these facilities, not long-term care for someone who cannot perform 
activities of daily living, like bathing, dressing, feeding...conditions that will
not improve. Plans see that kind of care as custodial and will not pay.   

A large majority of folks end up relying on Medicaid programs to cover long-term care, often in a facility, but also in an alternate program, like PACE (providing all inclusive care of the elderly).  Whether someone is eligible for Medicaid often depends on income and assets, disability, and/or age. Your county’s Department of Social Services would be your first contact for Medicaid questions and an application.   

You could also google “Area Agency on Aging” to get connected with folks who know over resources in your city/state for older populations who need placement or a community alternative. "
HealthInsurance,"The daily activities can be performed as long as the rehab is able to take place to allow them to build strength back up to their baseline. (The patient is only 56, but has been in a hospital bed for over a month and has gotten weak) 

Also, in regards to the insurance, I’m more concerned with how to handle the awfully incorrect documentation because the documentation shows diagnosis that are incredibly far from the truth. "
HealthInsurance,"Best way to find out is to call them and see if your in the system with coverage. You can also asked them if you stay on coverage till a certain age, etc.  

They would be the best source for what your looking for.

HealthInsurance,"Hi.  

Something is *very* wrong with this plan.  It says that it meets minimum value under the ACA (and is therefore ACA compliant) but there **is no way** that it is.  It doesn't cover emergency room visits, physicians fees in a hospital, diagnostic tests, and a bunch of other stuff.

ACA plans are required to cover all of [these](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/what-marketplace-plans-cover/) benefits, and this plan barely covers half of them.

Who the heck are you getting this plan from?  If it's a company, you need to call HR.  This is beyond whack.

paging /u/kalabash and /u/realanceps for help."
HealthInsurance,"Hello.

So, yes, your employer's coverage will *always* be primary, but anything that your primary carrier doesn't cover, your secondary will (assuming it's in benefit).  

So if one carrier is out of network, but the other one is in network, you're fine.

Which insurer have you been using?  "
HealthInsurance,"You can attempt to file a complaint for a HIPAA violation by visiting here: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/filing-a-complaint/index.html

HealthInsurance,"Nope, firing someone for posting something unrelated to the job as a violation of HIPAA when there was absolutely no mention of how or where this information came from is absurd. That name could have literally been seen on the side of a bus as far as reading the post goes. Firing someone for that is setting a precedent that basically if any name they post matches the database in which they work in would be a fire-able offense. ""OMG John is such a common name!"" = Fired because there is a John in the database? Again, nope, I'm afraid you're the one who is wrong here and I'd challenge anyone to fight it."

HealthInsurance,"Medicaid is retroactively effective from the day the request is filed.  (you file on the 1st, you are in the hospital on the 5th, and approved on the 10th).  Medicaid will cover you.  If your income has stopped, file then.  "
HealthInsurance,"""Ha! Today I came across the funny first name [___]. It reminds me of [something from a tv show that's not related in any way to health insurance].""

Where do you see a mention of a workplace in that post? The only way I can see it being possible is they got brought into a room and asked if they were talking about the patient and they replied yes (you'd have be an idiot to admit to this) and THEN they got fired. Otherwise, no. Not to mention they got fired a long while after posting it."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, this is interesting. 

Allegiance is a CIGNA unit. 

Their marketing slicks insist this plan is ACA-minimum-essential-coverage compliant, noting that the coverage includes ""emergency services"" -- even while the posted SBC-like document explicitly states that emergency room care is not covered. 
 Unless they've got someone to bless urgent care services as satisfying the ""emergency care coverage"" requirement, I'm not seeing how this plan suffices. [CMS info on Montana's EHB benchmarks](https://www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/data-resources/ehb.html#Montana) explicitly references inclusion of  ""Emergency **Room**"" care all over the place - and though the files currently available there all refer to plan years 2017 *and earlier*, there's no sign that info is no longer applicable."

HealthInsurance,"It's definitely going to depend a bit on company. One company I worked at taught us nothing but to parrot what the screen showed, and if we were unsure we had to ""send it back"" to someone who could actually tell. Others give a lot of training and latitude. What's the secondary insurer, if you don't mind me asking?

The types/methods will vary between insurers a bit as well since it's all of course whatever they want to offer to their clients (read: employer groups.) [This](http://files.donself.com/documents/Coordination-of-Benefits-2015.pdf) doc outlines a couple of the most common methods, but again there can be some internal variations. That being said, if the document I linked can break down the math and provide some hypotheticals, the reps at any top 5 insurer should be able to as well. They might need some help or time to research or even just time to ask someone else since it's not a hugely common call and can be convoluted, but the big companies should be able to help. Just might take some finagling.

As to your particular hypothetical, check out the ""crappier"" non-dupe method mentioned in that link I gave:

&gt; The secondary plan would review the payment of the primary plan, and if the primary payment is equal to or more than what the secondary payer would have paid on its own, no benefit would be payable.

If the primary says, ""the contracted rate is $500 but we're not paying anything because you haven't met your deductible,"" the secondary is going to look at the primary's EOB and process on the secondary's original liability minus what the primary _paid_.

If the secondary has a deductible as well, it'll take the primary's $500, subtract what the primary paid ($0), and apply the difference of $500 (natch) to the deductible.

The coordination type basically calculates what the secondary insurer ""has to work with.""

Primary allows $200 for a specialist's 99213 office visit. 

Pays nothing since deductible.

Secondary is a copay plan. $40 spec copay. Secondary says, ""what do we have to work with? $200 allowed minus zero paid means we pay $160 after the copay.""

The reason this method is often call the crappier one is because the more often scenario is:

Medicare allows $2,000 and pays 80%, which is $1,600.

Secondary calculates their allowable and comes up with $1,660.

Well, secondary takes what they would have originally allowed ($1,660) and subtracts what the primary paid ($1,600) and then calculates on the difference. Oh, you've met your deductible on your secondary? Nice! We'll pay 80%... of that difference of $60... Your primary paid $1,600 and your secondary paid $48... And you're still stuck with the remaining $352.

""Well, why do even have this insurance, then?""

""That's... a very valid question, sir, and one that gets asked quite a bit about this plan.""

---

Either way, if someone called in then I would have been able to explain it to them just that way as well with of course any necessary stops along the way. Hopefully you won't have to fish, but I promise there is help out there. Let me know if you have anymore questions."
HealthInsurance,"You'd better really investigate this. I purchase my plan off the exchange as I don't get any subsidies or tax credit--our income is too high, I live in Wisconsin. Read everything very carefully. ""Nearly identical"" means it isn't. Whatever changes there are may not affect you or they could be a real problem. Check the out-of-pocket, the out-of-network coverage, Maximum-out-of-pocket, drug formulary (if you take medication). There should be several documents giving the details. Some may be very brief, but the Certificate of Coverage may be over 100 pages. 

I'm curious, Open Enrollment ended last month, how are you able to make a change? "
HealthInsurance,"Are there any other ""gotchas"" like an out-of-network provider like some lab work sent out? A radiologist that was not under your contract? Those Max out of pocket have other pieces of fine print depending on what they think they need to pay. Like usual and customary/ UCR. I definitely agree with the others. Call, call again and document, document. It could be a simple error and it will eventually be sorted out."
HealthInsurance,What u/rocdanithegirl said
HealthInsurance,"It is up to the individual insurance company, ie BCBS, if they want to extend their deadline for marketplace customers (in addition to any state laws).  The company I work at has a soft deadline of 1/15 and a hard deadline of 1/31, for their marketplace customers.  I know some of the others in town, arent so flexy."
HealthInsurance,They gave me until end of month to change even though open enrollment is closed. I know a couple of people who also got the same notification and we’re all trying to figure out whether it’s worth doing or not. I’m leaning toward not doing it even though they say it’s cheaper.
HealthInsurance,"&gt; yeah, why pay out for a policy that’s not even going to pay for that yearly because they aren’t meeting the deductible?

Every marketplace plan covers annual checkups before any deductible is applied.


Didn't you say you work in healthcare? why don't you know this?


The treatment examples you've supplied are not why anyone needs health insurance. An insurer's promise to pay some or all of your treatment charges should you need highly-resource-intensive 'rescue care' and/or expensive care for a chronic illness - a promise of payment of tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars of treatment charges - is where the value lies. Most people by far, in most years, do not recoup the dollar value of their premium payments in reimbursement for services they obtain. And that's a *good* thing.


&gt;For healthy people, it’s a gamble... sure. But that’s why Obamacare is such a disaster.

I'd ask you what this even means, but I'm pretty sure you have zero idea"
HealthInsurance,"can you post a de-identified pic of this special notice you've received? Sounds really ""interesting"" (fishy)"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I would recommend calling school insurance first to confirm they are primary, then call parents insurance to confirm they are secondary.


This can result in a finger-pointing exercise: ""the other guy is primary"". 

COB ""rules"" are not laws - they're industry ""habits"", and in some instances, administrators haven't had sufficient experience with a particular pairing of plans to know what rule applies. A state insurance department *might* intercede to settlee disputes, but it will depend on the sophistication of the department in the state where the affected party resides, whether one or both of the plans involved is self-funded/protected by ERISA pre-emption, etc"
HealthInsurance,Worst case scenario if they have a life change event couldn’t they re apply?
HealthInsurance,Do you have a silver plan and not get subsidies?
HealthInsurance,"Im not in charge of making that decision, but there is a list of criteria that healthcare.gov uses to determine enrollment eligibility outside of the open enrollment window https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/

EDIT to clarify, if a company decides to accept a slightly late payment, the customer still has to pay all the way back to their date of enrollment, ie 1/1/18.  If the customer is eligible for a special new enrollment, their coverage will start on whatever new date they are able to apply for, eg 3/1/2018, and they wont be covered for anything before that date.
"
HealthInsurance,Correct.
HealthInsurance,I can't find anything for sure - But I would do as the others have suggested and give BCBS a call.
HealthInsurance,"If you went this way, with a non-ACA plan, you would still be on the hook for paying the fine (2.5% of your income) for 2018."
HealthInsurance,"Secondary insurances are meant to pay on the patient's responsibility set by their primary plan. Deductibles, copays, coinsurance, and the like. 
As long as you submit to secondary with the primary's EOB, you should have no problem with them paying. 

The only time this does become an issue is when the client has Medicare and a supplemental plan. Supplemental plans will not pay on claims unless Medicare has first. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes. I think I won't go with this non ACA plan now that I have done some reading on them. Whats the point in paying up to $500 or $600 a month for these zero deductible plans then get fined from the IRS at tax filing time?
"
HealthInsurance,"Exactly, it doesn't make much sense. The fine goes away for 2019 though, as of now, so next year it might make sense to take a look at it again. "

HealthInsurance,"Medi-Cal is California’s version of Medicaid. You would need to apply for Medicaid in whatever state you end up in, as you cannot have Medi-Cal if you’re no longer a resident of California."
HealthInsurance,"see I've had patients get secondary insurance so that they can pay the deductible of the primary plan and I tell them that's not allowed. that was one of the cardinal rules of secondary insurance that I was taught when I started and that I've seen (although I have minimal experience with secondary insurances). I always tell clients they can expect to pay both deductibles but that secondary will cover the coinsurance or copays of the primary. have you actually seen secondary pay a primary's deductible?
EDIT: wording, clarity"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;insurance company is saying that, generally, they do not cover pain medications or antibiotics that would be prescribed following an elective procedure.

Maybe they mean they don't cover stuff prescribed in conjunction with a procedure your policy *doesn't cover* - because not covering Rx related to a treatment they DO cover WOULD be unusual. 

Insurers, and policies, may handle the ""Rx related to non-covered treatments"" situations differently. Do you have any documentation of what they're telling you that you can share?"
HealthInsurance,"wow, thank you so much, your response was so helpful! I'll have to read through what you said again and the link you added since I've been looking for that info for a long time (almost 3 years managing the revenue cycle for a small practice and I'm learning every day!). so just to be sure I'm reading correctly in the example with the $500 contracted rate, you mean that the secondary could apply that to their deductible as well so the patient payment of $500 could satisfy both deductibles?

Since you asked, this particular patient has BCBS as primary and UMR as secondary and both have a $1000 deductible with 80% coinsurance. I always assumed that for patient responsibility you'd add up the two deductibles plus the 20% left over from the primary then 20% of that amount for the secondary coinsurance (like what you said for the crappier method) so it's nice to know that's not always the case!"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! I will call them again. What are you referring to when you say ""call number""? Is that the code for the service?"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! I added up my EOBs and the parts I owe are way over $6,000. My plan literature indicates that the $6,000 out-of-pocket maximum includes the deductible."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you! This is in line with my understanding after reading my plan literature. However, this is not what my insurance company is saying. Other than calling them again and arguing about this, do you have any suggestions for additional action I can take?"
HealthInsurance,Thank you! I reviewed all of the materials I have received from my insurance provider and nothing was out-of-network. I will call them again. Do you have any suggestions for additional action I can take? Is there a way I can ask them to formally respond to me in writing which would remove any possibility for ambiguity regarding why I have been charged over my out-of-pocket maximum?
HealthInsurance,"Interesting. So you are probably in a strange situation, confined to certain states, where off-Marketplace plans would actually save you quite a bit of money. See [this](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-covered-california-surcharge-20171010-story.html) for the wonky details. I'm not sure what BCBS's motivation is for having you switch -- it's possible they're worried too many people in your situation will drop coverage because of the cost -- but as long as the coverage is similar it could save you quite a bit."
HealthInsurance,"1. You can still buy policies that don’t cover yearly check-ups.  They don’t meet Obamacare regs and you’ll pay the fine for doing so, but they cover catastrophic experiences.  I’ve done it and working in healthcare is why I know that :)

2. Why Obamacare is such a disaster is related to #1.  If you’re healthy, you should be able to buy those catastrophic plans without being penalized.  The premiums are cheaper, deductibles are higher but if you’ve got a well-funded HSA, you can use it to offset what that plan doesn’t cover (yearlys, office visits).  Again, done that and know lots of others who managed just fine in those circumstances.

As I said, it’s a gamble but then again, so is insurance.  Problem is... we are now in a situation where we’re penalized for not taking the bet and forced to sit at a table with minimums that are beyond most people’s means.

I’d prefer to choose which healthcare casino I patronize (or not to) as well as how much I’m going to bet.

The income cutoff for institutional level of care is much higher than for community level of care.  It sounds like your mom is in this for the long haul, if it's eventually returning home with caregivers, or living in a nursing facility long term.  What state are you in?"
HealthInsurance,"And here's a few links that might be helpful, just for vocabulary if nothing else.  These are links about the stadard medicare benfit.  An advantage plan can't deny you these benefits, other than controlling their provider network, but they can *add* benefits if they choose, and this would be in your policy documents.  Usually these are related to routine chronic illness issues for people who live at home, like meds or medical supplies, but it is worth looking at any long term care provisions she might have.

My understanding for example - if you have a basic visit that costs $500, your plan pays 90% of that, you'd be responsible for $50, and that amount would apply to your deductible. Once you hit the full amount of the deductible you just have copays and no more responsibility. The max out of pocket is the no-matter-what amount you'd be responsible for even if you had a major surgery."
HealthInsurance,"3600 is max. There is no copay until that is reached. I pay everything out of pocket until I hit 3600. That’s how it was explained to me. "
HealthInsurance,"So are you saying the total premium is $676 and you only pay $376 of it? That’s pretty good. "
HealthInsurance,"Ya, that'd make sense. It seems like a tactic to make you not use it unless absolutely necessary. It probably costs your employer less to have it that way. What's the max out of pocket? I have a feeling you may be confusing that for the deductible."
HealthInsurance,The way I'm reading it is that it's $376 and they pay $300. If he adds on dependents then the max they pay is still $300.
HealthInsurance,"Have you received an offer from employer? If so, maybe ask whomever offered to provide you a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) for the health coverage options available. SBCs are a sort of standardized-format ""nutrition label"" for health coverage, are typically 8-10 pages long, &amp; [they look like this](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf). Plans and/or sponsors are obliged to provide them for people who are covered &amp; if you've been offered a job with benefits as part of your compensation, it's something the offerer should be comfortable providing you.

Sometimes employers make the documents available outside their intranet/firewall (public employers, mostly, but still); try googling [employer name] ""summary of benefits and coverage ""."

Just to clarify, when we're saying dependent here, are we still talking about a child who's &lt;27 but otherwise completely removed from the parents or does the child have to be filed as such on the parent's taxes or otherwise depend on them financially? My friend will be over eighteen, filing their own taxes, with no financial support from their parent. Does what we're talking about apply in that scenario? How is the relationship even proved without tax dependent status? If a parent lost custody of their seventeen-year-old, would they still be able to open a policy including them eight years later? Does it all go off the parent's word on the grounds that if they're lying it constitutes insurance fraud anyway? I also know (or believe) that this sort of thing includes step-children. Can they be enrolled by their step-parent at 26 without their consent? I guess what I'm getting at is: without your acknowledgment, how is it determined, once you're an independent adult, who your parent is for this purpose? Is it whoever it was when you turned eighteen? What if you emancipated?

When a parent enrolls their child without the child's consent, how does the insurance company verify that any sensitive information they send about the child, like EOB's, is not being sent to the parents, assuming that the child refuses to participate in the process at all? Where do they get that address and how do they verify in a HIPAA compliant way that it does in fact belong to the child before sending sensitive information? Is it again on the parent, and if they're lying it constitutes fraud on their part?

Can you enroll an eligible person with no relationship to you whatsoever in a plan against their will so long as you're willing to pay for it, in this same manner? Before the ACA required insurance companies to support children &lt;27, was this sort of thing still possible for children assuming you found a policy that allowed you to cover adult children? What's not computing for me is the fact that I don't believe you can open a policy for a random person (which might be wrong), but it's not clear to me what relevant legal connection you have to your parent once they're no longer your legal guardian and you're no longer a tax dependent or tenant or anything of theirs, ie; once you're legally just a random person to them. It's not the fact that they conceived you, since adoption/step-parenthood comes into play in all of this, and it's not who you're financially dependent on or who has guardianship over you because neither of those things are necessarily true at 26, so it must be whoever your legal parent happened to be when you turned eighteen I suppose. When I go to enroll my adult, tax-independent child in a policy, what is the exact qualification they use when determining that this person is currently my child, since it's apparently not legal guardianship or tax dependent status?

Is a private insurance company allowed have terms denying you coverage, whether completely or just specific plans they offer, if you presently have coverage elsewhere? If they're allowed, is that at all typical?

Am I right in assuming that moving across state lines (from MI to AZ) will likely cause my friend to no longer be eligible for the policy? I really hope I am because that's the last thing I can think of. If that won't necessarily affect things, is there any way whatsoever to get my friend off this plan should their parent choose to keep paying for it? And if not, what do we do if a member service's rep tells their parents sensitive information? Which I know that they will if the parents speak to enough representatives. If the parents do call and claim to be my friend to get that information, especially contact information, is that a crime on their part or is it the insurance company's responsibility since they apparently didn't sufficiently verify? 

It's honestly really disturbing to me that this is possible. Imagine if you, an independent adult, went to open a bank account and they told you that someone else had opened an account in your name at another bank (which you may or may not trust) and that all your purchases had to be sent to that other bank for consideration before they would process them, whether you trusted that bank with that information or not. In this case it's BCBS, who most would consider trustworthy (I don't because underpaid call center workers with no tangible stake in HIPAA compliance handle your info when you call), but it's not like there aren't small insurance companies out there with questionable management. The power that this gives parents over their adult children even eight years after they leave home is ridiculous."
HealthInsurance,"/u/unluckyluke "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Just to clarify, when we're saying dependent here, are we still talking about a child who's &lt;27 but otherwise completely removed from the parents or does the child have to be filed as such on the parent's taxes or otherwise depend on them financially?

Yes.  With respect to health insurance a ""dependent"" is any eligible member regardless of their age (up to 26 for ""child"" dependents), financial dependency (or lack thereof), residence, etc.  Generally the only requirement is a degree of familial status with the employee or policy holder.

&gt;My friend will be over eighteen, filing their own taxes, with no financial support from their parent. Does what we're talking about apply in that scenario? 

Makes no difference whatsoever.  They are eligible so long as they are under age 26 - age is the ONLY matter of eligibility with respect to ""child"" dependents.  I use quotes around ""child"" because under practically any other definition a person age 18 or older is an adult, but for health insurance there are really only 3 designations - employee/policy holder, spouse, and child.  Anyone/everyone except the employee/policy holder is considered a ""dependent.""

&gt;How is the relationship even proved without tax dependent status?

For employer sponsored coverage, it's up to the employer and whatever protocol they use.  The insurance co just gets an enrollment file from the employer that lists who is covered.  Employers might not require any proof at all other than the word of the employee.  It's up to them.  Though an employee that lies about dependent eligibility is committing fraud (a federal felony).  Most employers/insurance cos. require a copy of the birth certificate at most.  The law says that children up to age 26 are eligible regardless of tax status.

&gt;Does it all go off the parent's word on the grounds that if they're lying it constitutes insurance fraud anyway?

Pretty much.  Birth certificate/certificate of adoption or, in the case of a spouse, a marriage license is usually needed nowadays.  There's no law that says documented proof is required, but it's probably in the best interest of the employer or insurer to request some sort of proof and they are allowed (at their discretion) to request reasonable documentation.

&gt;When a parent enrolls their child without the child's consent, how does the insurance company verify that any sensitive information they send about the child, like EOB's, is not being sent to the parents, assuming that the child refuses to participate in the process at all?

The employee/policy holder has the *right* to a certain amount of information regarding claims activity of all enrolled members under their coverage.  Remember that in an employer sponsored coverage situation, the coverage is part of the employee's compensation for work.  Like when you're paid, you have the right to know how much is taken out of your check for the IRS, etc.  Benefits paid on behalf of a covered member child dependent are a form of employee compensation.  The employee has the *right* to know about certain aspects of each and every benefit payment.

There is a certain amount of information that is required by law to be included on an EOB - patient name, date services were provided, who submitted a claim (the provider of service), how much was charged.  Even if the child dependent does not reside with the employee/parent, that employee/parent is entitled to that information.  EOBs should not include diagnosis or specific procedure/treatment information.  Only the minimum amount of *financial* information is to be included on the EOB.

&gt;Can you enroll an eligible person with no relationship to you whatsoever in a plan against their will so long as you're willing to pay for it, in this same manner?

Theoretically, yes.  Though it's unlikely that just anyone with no relationship to you is going to be eligible.  If you're not the spouse, natural child, adopted child, step-child, foster child, or (rarely, but I've seen it before) grandchild - that person is not eligible.

Posting so I don't accidentally lose all this - more coming."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Before the ACA required insurance companies to support children &lt;27, was this sort of thing still possible for children assuming you found a policy that allowed you to cover adult children?

Yes.  The law established, at a federal level, the minimum.  Insurers or employers can, and have always been able to, go way beyond that as far as who is eligible.  An insurer or employer could say your entire family tree, plus neighbors within 6 houses on all sides are eligible if they want (and could do so before the ACA as well).  They just don't - for what I think are obvious reasons.

&gt;Is a private insurance company allowed have terms denying you coverage, whether completely or just specific plans they offer, if you presently have coverage elsewhere? If they're allowed, is that at all typical?

If the plan is offered on the exchange, then no.  You may not qualify for a subsidy, but I'm fairly certain you can't be excluded for individual/private coverage simply on the basis of having other coverage.  My area of expertise is more with the employer sponsored side and I'm not as well versed in individual/private coverage eligibility.

Off exchange, I'm not sure.

&gt;Am I right in assuming that moving across state lines (from MI to AZ) will likely cause my friend to no longer be eligible for the policy? 

Incorrect.  Child dependents under age 26 are eligible regardless of where they reside, even in foreign countries.

&gt;If that won't necessarily affect things, is there any way whatsoever to get my friend off this plan should their parent choose to keep paying for it?

I'm not aware of there being any way, the way the law is currently interpreted.  That is not to say there isn't a way.  I just don't know how it could reasonably be done.

&gt;And if not, what do we do if a member service's rep tells their parents sensitive information? 

File a complaint with the governing regulatory body - I'm not sure which off the top of my head.  Also a civil suit is possible.  That's lawyer territory.  I'm not a lawyer.

&gt;Which I know that they will if the parents speak to enough representatives. If the parents do call and claim to be my friend to get that information, is that a crime on their part or is it the insurance company's responsibility since they apparently didn't sufficiently verify?

I'm reasonably certain it's a crime to represent yourself as someone else in order to obtain private information.  To the degree that it's the responsibility is subject to interpretation and there would likely have to be some sort of investigation (I would think) to determine liability.  Your idea of what is ""sufficiently"" verified might be different than what a regulatory body considers sufficient.

&gt;It's honestly really disturbing to me that this is possible. Imagine if you, an independent adult, went to open a bank account and they told you that someone else had opened an account in your name at another bank (which you may or may not trust) and that all your purchases had to be sent to that other bank for consideration before they would process them, whether you trusted that bank with that information or not.

This kind of thing happens to people all the time.  It's called identity theft.

&gt;In this case it's BCBS, who most would consider trustworthy (I don't because underpaid call center workers with no tangible stake in HIPAA compliance handle your info when you call), but it's not like there aren't small insurance companies out there with questionable management. The power that this gives parents over their adult children even eight years after they leave home is ridiculous.

Call center employees actually do have a stake - their jobs are at stake.  To some that might not seem like much, I suppose.

In any of these scenarios you describe (or any that we could reasonably conceive) someone is breaking the law - most likely the parents should they lie about who they are.  It seems like a simple thing to do.  

Sounds to me like the real problem here are the parents.  There's only so much an insurer can reasonably do to protect a member's privacy without putting undue burden on an individual to prove their identity.

In the end, a determined individual with little regard for the law will be able, eventually, to lie, cheat, and steal their way into the information they want.  Does that make the insurance company culpable?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; EOBs should not include diagnosis or specific procedure/treatment information.

So I know for a fact that the EOBs I work with include exactly what was done, but like I said the policies I work with by their nature never include more than one person. For employer policies, is it guaranteed that this information won't be included in EOBs sent to the policy-holder? You mentioned provider name. What about doctors who only deal in one specific thing? If I visit a clinic specializing solely in STD's for example and that clinic is listed on the EOB, does that not violate HIPAA if due efforts aren't taken to obfuscate that information or ensure that I'm the one receiving it?

Thank you so much for your help by the way. Like I said the parents do have a specific focus on my friend's medical activities, as well as the potential that they flat out get their contact info through this, so knowing all this is very important to us. I know that at some point the parents' use of this and other information to bother my friend just constitutes standard harassment/stalking type stuff no longer specific to the insurance side of things, but I'd like to prevent as much of it as we can."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Incorrect. Child dependents under age 26 are eligible regardless of where they reside, even in foreign countries.

Will they still require my friend's permanent address, and if my friend declines to provide one and the parent is unable, what will happen? Is there any contact info that the insurance company will be required to have to provide coverage and if my friend is unwilling to provide it (and if necessary, explicitly denies them permission to have it), is there any means by which they'll obtain it anyway to continue providing coverage?

&gt;Sounds to me like the real problem here are the parents

You're telling me :)"
HealthInsurance,"The tax bill doesn't eliminate the penalty until 2019. That means that those who forgo health insurance for 2018 could still face a penalty. The penalty for not having health insurance this year is $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater."
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"&gt;For employer policies, is it guaranteed that this information won't be included in EOBs sent to the policy-holder? 

Guaranteed?  I can't guarantee you anything.  But a diagnosis is considered protected health information under HIPAA and should not be included on an EOB for a qualified health plan. 

&gt;If I visit a clinic specializing solely in STD's for example

I don't think that exists.  But lets say Planned Parenthood.  Some people might assume you're going for an abortion. It's still just a guess.  They do routine mammograms too.  I suppose if you went to Hazelden or Betty Ford that could narrow it down some.  But there's no violation no matter how specific or limited in scope a provider would be."
HealthInsurance,Many high deductible plans don't have the office visit copay and require you pay the visit in full if the deductible isn't met yet. With your medical condition it is a great thing this plan gives you a copay for office visits instead of the full charge! I would rather pay $35 compared to several hundred.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Will they still require my friend's permanent address

No - probably.  They only need the employee address.  Child dependent addresses are pretty much irrelevant.

&gt;Is there any contact info that the insurance company will be required to have to provide coverage and if my friend is unwilling to provide it (and if necessary, explicitly denies them permission to have it), is there any means by which they'll obtain it anyway?

That's up to the insurer.  They won't go hunting for it though.  If they need it they will ask for it.  It no one offers it, it's up to the insurer.  Insurers each have their own internal processes."
HealthInsurance,"Does my friend have the legal right to deny the insurance company permission to keep their address or other contact info on file? Also, is contact info (not medical info) covered under something similar to HIPAA, in that the insurance co has a duty to keep it private?"
HealthInsurance,"I don't think so, but that's a guess.  Not sure.  It's sort of like the internet.  Once it's there, it's there forever."

HealthInsurance,"Is the insurance company allowed, legally, to refuse claims on the grounds that they don't have my friend's address (or other arbitrary grounds)? And if they do, will that affect COB with a new policy eg; cause them to deny claims since the primary insurance hasn't processed them yet?"
HealthInsurance,"Your out of luck. Anyone that will  sell you a plan is not selling legitimate health insurance. It is most likely a plan that would make you submit receipts and they would reimburse you and you still would have to pay the fine unless you qualify for a hardship. "
HealthInsurance,I am out of my element here
HealthInsurance,"Insurers will deny claims when they don't have enough information to process the claim.  Usually it's additional medical criteria or other medical necessity information they're looking for.  Not having someone's address wouldn't necessarily be a reason to deny - not for a dependent under an employee, assuming they have the employee's address at least.

If a claim is denied for lack of information - for secondary insurance to process - it's going to depend upon a some variables.  The secondary plan is entitled to a copy of the primary plan's EOB for them to process the claim.  The EOB will show the denial reason and who's responsible for the charges.  It is possible that the secondary insurance would deny the claim simply on the basis of the primary insurance denial.

But I doubt that the primary insurance would deny for not having a child dependent's physical address because the insurer doesn't need the address.  Back nearly 20 years ago when I was in customer service (well before the ACA) and anyone over age 18 needed to be a full-time student to stay on their parent's plan, we didn't keep the child's address even then.  All we needed was proof of full-time status from the university administration.  We didn't keep a record of where they went to school or anything.  It was just a Y or N in the system - yes student status was established or no it was not.

Now, insurers don't need it to establish eligibility (other than familial relationship, like with a birth certificate) because the child is eligible regardless of where they live, whether they're a student or not, etc.  The insurer only needs the employee's/policy holder's address, which they would already have to even get the family in the system in the first place.

So is it ""legally"" allowed to deny just for an adult child's address?  I suppose it might be, maybe?  It's definitely something that isn't practical for an insurer to do."
HealthInsurance,"Good to know/good point! Thank you. "
HealthInsurance,I see. Thank you for your help!

HealthInsurance,"&gt;I skipped enrolling in insurance during open enrollment again this year, because I can't really afford health insurance in addition to my loans, rent, food, etc. I'm not making so little as to qualify for Medicaid, but I'm not making enough to pay all my bills and also another $100/mo for insurance. 

It feels like you're unaware that you would probably qualify for premium tax credits that would reduce your monthly premium payments to, or nearly to, zero. Is that possible?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;why the fuck do i have to pay for the months which i wasn't even covered.

Your coverage isn't like a bank account into which money is deposited for your exclusive use.

Your premium payments buy you the insurer's promise to pay some or all of your treatment bills in the unfortunate event you need one or more covered treatments.

Does that help?"
HealthInsurance,"I was an OPT Student myself for quite awhile, and my USCIS Interview is actually happening in 3 days!

Anyhow, I would like to chime in a bit.
I've purchased a few regular ""International Student Health Insurance"" through a few online websites.

Most of them aren't as costly, but at the same time have high deductibles. I've been to a few lab tests, and at most I will have to pay at a discounted rate (thanks to the ""coverage"".

Since you're married, you should be able to claim her as spouse / dependent on your own health insurance plan. It's more costly, but I reckon the big names company would give you a bit more coverage than these.

I'm a contractor working for a health care company, and I'm paying around $300 per month, to have both me and my wife at a Basic plan ($0 Deductible)."
HealthInsurance,"Hello, yes there are tricks of the trade.  

Firstly, as Ireland is a member of the EU, it is far easier to get treatment approved from a provider in the EU or Switzerland.  The Health System Executive (HSE) will cover treatment not available in Ireland if it provided in the EU or switzerland.  For this, you need a referral from your primary doctor, who will need to file form E112.  There are four requirements to get this treatment covered.

* The treatment concerned is not available in Ireland
* There is an urgent medical need for the treatment
* There is a reasonable chance of success
* It is a proven type of treatment, not experimental and will be performed by registered doctors/recognised hospitals.

So, if you can find someone in the EU/switzerland who you believe can perform the service, then it is much more of a routine process to get it approved.

Now, when it comes to the US, the HSE will help pay for treatment, but it is much more of a complicated process, and is far from guaranteed.  For example, the UK only has one situation in which the NHS will automatically cover treatment in the US: proton beam therapy to treat cancer.  Everything else, is case by case.

TBH, this gets outside my level of experience.  I suggest that you contact an expert; and also your TD.  Much like American Congressmen, your TDs are paid to help their constituents; they may be able to point you in the right direction. However, if you feel like saving yourself a bunch of time, you could ask the surgeon here in the US if he recommends anyone in Europe (which will be much easier to get approved)."
HealthInsurance,both of these things are right.  tuition waiver is *definitely* not countable income.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  I find it hard to believe that I can only buy insurance six weeks out of the year.  

If this weren't the case, people would just sign up when they got sick. The ACA did away with consideration of preexisting conditions.
"
HealthInsurance,"fines still exist. the only way to save some $$ as far as I can tell is if you stop paying your insurance company from October til the end of the year and then they'll take away your coverage (they don't come after you to pay, they just take it away); the fine doesn't apply unless you go more than 3 months without coverage in a single year. "
HealthInsurance,look into short-term plans; they're intended for people in your situation who are going from one coverage to another and usually don't last more than 6 months. they're not great but usually they don't cost very much.
HealthInsurance,"Yeah. Last year they took my $700 refund and added another $600 that I owed. Over 2k out of my pocket with nothing to show for it. "
HealthInsurance,"Honestly that’s a terrible idea for someone with a serious pre-existing condition. OP, Healthcare.gov is what you want - you will qualify to enroll in plans outside of open enrollment based on moving, and can get financial help based on your expected income. It’s designed for people with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid. "
HealthInsurance,"You will qualify for a health insurance plan from Covered California as long as you don’t have an offer of affordable employer coverage. You will get financial help to make the plan more affordable. Vision is going to be harder, though - a few health insurance plans like Kaiser often cover it, but most don’t. "
HealthInsurance,"oh you're right, I forgot that moving was a qualifying event. but people forget about short term plans and they can be an option for a lot of people."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,Did they not qualify for any subsidies through the ACA? Seems like they should have.
HealthInsurance,"The problem I see with this approach is that you don’t need health insurance until you do. You never know what will happen (heaven forbid) in the next 18 months, especially at that age. It’s a risk for sure, but I’m not sure I’d be comfortable with doing that. "
HealthInsurance,I see no issues with this but I might suggest that they look into an HSA for “just in case”.
HealthInsurance,"We disagree about whether they are often a good option for people — but if you’re going to recommend them you need to do your due diligence. Recommending them to OP could have had serious consequences, and I’ll note literally the first line of their post states they recently had a stroke. "
HealthInsurance,"Why does it only matter about your dad/when he is eligible for medicare?  Also for 2k a month they are probably buying some pretty good insurance.

HealthInsurance,"I'm 63 and think about doing this all the time, but the chances for something going horrifically wrong are just too high.   
I'm just entering my golden years and an unexpected catastrophic illness could ruin the rest of my life financially speaking."
HealthInsurance,"Probably what I should've done from the start, thank you! "
HealthInsurance,"There are timely filing limits for how late a provider can submit a claim for payment. I guess they may have submitted to your insurance in time. 
If they submitted the claim on time and it was a non-covered procedure, then you're pretty much stuck with the bill. 

Best practice would be to call your member services and verify your benefits before hand if you're unsure about whether you have coverage for something."
HealthInsurance,"Hard to say without seeing what your health plan specifically states for a specialist office visits. I will say though, that you have to be wary with dermatology. If they remove a wart or take a biopsy that is considered a surgical procedure. And then it is no longer just an office visit, but gets billed as an outpatient surgery."
HealthInsurance,Does the bill show an insurance adjustment or payment?  You can also try finding the Explanation of Benefits from your insurer and compare the two.
HealthInsurance,It's also possible that it's being billed under your child's name - In which case you'd need to meet the family out of pocket maximum.
HealthInsurance,By in large yes - There's a list of covered procedures you can find.  Again they don't have any cost-sharing.
HealthInsurance,"It is possible he did call and verify your insurance and everything was ok at the time, then a retro update was done. I’d try calling the insurance company to see if there is a record of the call and of them telling him you were covered."
HealthInsurance,"I recently changed employers myself. I had the option to retain my old insurance through COBRA, but it was insanely expensive. At my old job I was paying $224 a month for family coverage, and my employer contributed the rest. After leaving my employment, I got my COBRA coverage offer letter. It would have been like $1780 a month to continue my insurance plan. F that! I quickly declined it, and took the health plan that my new job offered."
HealthInsurance,"It shouldn't matter that you're paying the claim in 2018, it should fall under 2017 benefits, since that was the date(s) of service. You're going to have to call member services and ask them what the patient responsibility on the claim is. You shouldn't be getting a bill for that amount if your insurance already paid and you're that close to your OOP max and deductible."
HealthInsurance,Did you ever get an answer? Wondering the same thing.
HealthInsurance,"Not really.  My lawyer just says to not sign it.  If they insist I sign, I thinking of just putting ""My Name for Family Member Name"" for consent to treat only. Not financially responsible."
HealthInsurance,"The original bill is for $32,000 with a discount and plan payment leaving the $3,000. The claim states it is an ""adjustment on a previously processed claim. The allowable has been adjusted based on a medical review authorization."" "
HealthInsurance,"It is on behalf of kiddo. Our family out of pocket maximum is $8,000 (my individual OOP was $4,000.) My plan usage lists us as having applied $7,824.96 leaving only $175.04 left. "

&gt;I was under my mom's healthcare for most of the year last year until I turned of age. *My mom quit her job earlier that year....*

&gt;....so I called up B-insurance after my birthday trying to figure out if I could join their individual healthcare plan if my job refuses to allow me to enroll. They ended up telling me that I had 30 extra days of coverage because of my mom's job. 

why would B extend you **any** coverage now, given that neither your mom nor you has been covered for, presumably, many months?

And you've described Q as ""your"" insurance, when in fact you haven't actually had ""Q insurance"" - Q is what your employer offers, but you werern't enrolled believing you were  covered by mom's insurance, which you probably weren't, for several months now. Do you KNOW if mom somehow continued her coverage from B after she quit? If she didn't, you weren't covered either, &amp; would not satisfy any conventional qualifying standards for enrolling in your employer's plan.

Employers will typically ask you to document your eligibilty to enroll ""off cycle"" (outside their customary enrollment periods). They don't typically just act on your telling them you are eligible. What documents or messages have you gotten from either of these health plans about this situation? If you can de-identify any you've gotten (remove your name/address/company name/anything that would readily enable someone to know you are you) &amp; post, that might help clear up the confusion about what's going on here."

HealthInsurance,What for the explanation of benefits from your carrier before you pay anything.
HealthInsurance,"Shop around dentists, get a 2nd opinion, that's insanely high.  Also there are dental discount plans available where you get the carriers discounts but pay for it yourself.

Also, for the rx check goodrx.com for a discount drug card."
HealthInsurance,"The EOB and bill have the same amount due. It's in-network, but I'm just not sure if I have to pay the full $3,000 even though once I pay the $175 I'll have reached my OOP and (as I thought I understood) should not have to pay a dime more. Do I just make that payment and insurance provider pays the rest? Do I pay the entire thing and get a credit? It's confusing because I'll hit that limit MID-bill. "
HealthInsurance,"
&gt;The receptionist deceived me when he verified my insurance, telling me I was covered when I really was not. I would not have received the consultation if I was aware that I was not covered, but my insurance didn't notify me that changes occurred and the doctors office that is responsible for verifying patient coverage lied to me.

Its not the receptionist responsibility to verify your benefits, its yours. You are responsible for the bill.

&gt;Do I complain to the insurance company (I am no longer with them)? The doctors office? Both? If this had been a costly procedure (surgery, ER visit, etc.) I could have potentially ended up owing thousands of dollars, with none of the fault being my own.

This is ALL your fault. You didnt even have coverage. You presented with no insurance basically. I tend to side with patients on these issues but you, and only you are responsible for knowing your insurance benefits, and knowing if you even have coverage is about as basic as it gets. "
HealthInsurance,"In the case of ""my insurance"", I meant I thought B-insurance was going to terminate on my birthday.

My mom was still paying for coverage on my behalf after no longer being at the job (she actually retired). My mom most likely has documentation from B-insurance, though I don't know what that documentation says regarding date, though I do know that my claims were processed for any time leading up to my birthday.

I was ultimately told by B-insurance that my coverage ended 30 days after my birthday, and that's also what it indicated online. My dental and vision terminated on my birthday, also indicated online. B-insurance didn't extend me coverage up until present-day (sounds like what you're thinking had also happened), only that my medical was extended for an extra 30 days past my birthday, while dental and vision were not. This is the online screenshot, sorry for the silly edits: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sPJYhpx7QFzAkFKzlN5lOtnanXDTCHHR/view?usp=sharing

I had gone to the doctor some time between Sept 1 - Sept 30, and my birthday is Aug 31.

I enrolled in Q-insurance on the Sept 30 for health and vision, they did allow me to enroll in vision on that day.

My employer actually did not ask for any kind of documentation to prove this life event, it was verbal via their hotline. Unrelated, but yes, I did call prior to my birthday to understand what needed to be done. I'll see if I can upload documents here. 

Edit: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XeL9DMzsOhMsWkTPrfluLGygKaLIFrSo/view?usp=sharing
(where the 30th would be, like Sept 30) and, this next image isn't relevant but it shows you what's on the other side of this document.

That's all I have from my employer."
HealthInsurance,It sounds like this bill is included in the $7824 you have toward your family OOP max.
HealthInsurance,"This might help you out: https://www.kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/preventive-services-covered-by-private-health-plans/   
Something like a glucose monitoring device would only be covered if the patient has a diabetes-related diagnosis. They wouldn't cover it as a screening tool."
HealthInsurance,"HMO. No out of network benefits.

I am grateful for your taking the time and interest to respond, but I just heard from the facility I'm trying to enroll with, and they won't have any openings until after my psychiatrist returns from leave, so he can do the research on medical journals.

Thanks again. "
HealthInsurance,"1) It is not the receptionist's job to verify coverage, it's yours. They shouldn't even be making a claim to you that something will or won't be covered because they have no way of knowing that.
2) $150 is a small bill. What was the consultation? 

You said you were no covered, but why weren't you covered? Was your insurance not valid on that date? Was the insurance billed too late for the claim by the doctor which is why it was denied and they are going after you? Was the provider out of network? Was the visit billed under a code that isn't covered by your plan? Was the code it was billed under correct?

The first step is to check your insurance online and find the EOB for that claim to see what insurance said about it. If there is no claim, call your insurance and ask if any claim was filed or why it was denied. You need to know why the Drs office is saying if wasn't covered and why they are billing you. There are a few possibilities here.

1) The didn't bill in a timely manner and insurance rejected the claim or its too late for them to even bother trying so they went to you directly. This violates their agreement with your insurance assuming they accept your insurance and is a big no-no for them to do.
2) The Dr is out of network or the procedure isn't covered. In this case you owe the bill and need to pay it.
3) The office coded the procedure wrong and need to resubmit to insurance. So long as the visit was a covered procedure and all that by insurance at that location to see that doctor, then you should be fine and just need to get them to submit under the correct code.

If anyone else has any other ideas on this situation please advise as I'm not in the industry and don't know everything about it "
HealthInsurance,Hey this is an awesome resource. Thank you so much for taking the time to point it out to me!
HealthInsurance,"You're not going to find an hsa plan that covers both of you for anywhere near 300 a month.  "
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"I was hoping for a ~100k deductible, similar to life insurance type plan. But thanks for confirming the non existance. "
HealthInsurance,"Oh, THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL RESOURCE I WILL USE IT TO FIND OUT WHAT ENVISIONRX IS I WAS A FUCKING IDIOT TO ASK A QUESTION ON REDDIT IN THE FIRST PLACE"
HealthInsurance,"Me too. Just want to talk to someone who does employer group plans. Like I said, my hours eclipse theirs, otherwise I'd just call. I've been doing some research online and haven't gotten a straight answer at all, I see people saying you can remove yourself even if your parents don't want you to, I see people saying you can remove yourself only if your parents want you to, can't do it if they don't want you to and I've even seen people claiming that you could remove yourself then put yourself back on without your parents permission, even if that results in a higher premium for them. Basically nobody has any clue but they chime in anyway. I mean the extreme example of this is that somebody could be 26 years old married with kids, their own house, their own coverage, and their parents could just randomly decide that actually we're putting you on our insurance and you don't have a choice and that seems extremely wrong to me just on the nature of how contracts work in this world. In normal circumstances if your parents don't pay their insurance and it gets sent to collections, could you be responsible for that as a member of the plan? If so, and if parents can arbitrarily add/remove you, could you be stuck with a debt for a service you never wanted or agreed to? I don't want to believe that's possible and from what I know it shouldn't be, but that's the logical conclusion I come to from the idea that someone can take out health insurance on others without their permission.

I think this is also kind of a rare issue, since if someone else is paying for your insurance that's usually a good thing, but in this case we've decided it's not worth it for the very real risk of the parents getting info they shouldn't have and possibly using it in some way. Like if my friend wanted to have their EOB's and other important info mailed to them, which isn't unreasonable, they would have to update their mailing address with the insurance, which I could easily see a member services rep telling the parents should they ask. Huge breech of HIPAA but I see it happen every day."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Hey, thank you so much for the response! In his message he said Medicare and only mentioned that the information was provided to him by a nurse navigator at the hospital. I will call him in the a.m. to get more information and see if he has any documentation. 
Thank you! "
HealthInsurance,I don’t understand 1) why they care and 2) how they found out
HealthInsurance,"I cant help on the insurance front, but I had lost my coverage and my job a while back. The manufacturer for Vyvanse (whose name escapes me rn) has a program to make it more affordable if you're in a financial pickle. There's some hoops to jump through, but I snagged 12 months of free meds."
HealthInsurance,"It often isn't (advantageous).  And it can be difficult to determine precisely how much you might save.  It has to do with how the secondary plan coordinates and the method (math stuff) used, which can be next to impossible to find out before you enroll and can see the dollars on paper (claims experience).

One simple thing you can do is weigh your out-of-pocket medical expense for a given year against the total premium for a year you would pay for the second plan.

If your OOP expense on one plan is $5,000 for the year and the total premium for the year for the second plan is $8,000 then it's not going to be worth it (paying $8,000 to potentially save $5,000).

If those numbers go the other way, then you want to determine whether your providers are in-network for the other plan.  If they are not, it's not going to be worth it."
HealthInsurance,"A letter of med necessity from your doctor is a good start. "
HealthInsurance,"From a separate doctor than the one who requested it? "
HealthInsurance,"The one requesting it. "
HealthInsurance,Do you know why it was denied? I.e. Do they want you to try XYZ medication first? Is it non-covered? Not enough info submitted the first time?
HealthInsurance,"I spoke with him this morning. The insurance is Medicare. He was not provided with any documentation of the change in coverage. He is contacting the nurse navigator, his physician, and surgeon. I will post documents if and when I receive them.
"
HealthInsurance,It's covered in the plan. They sent almost forty pages of info which show 3 failed preventative meds and my use of 15 imitrex a month
HealthInsurance,"Ok thanks - I believe he already did that though "
HealthInsurance,"I apologize for not getting back here sooner.  Life has been hectic these last few weeks.  
 
That said I have read your posts and discussed with my wife.  I believe we'll be doing the COBRA bridge strategy which /u/realanceps pointed me towards.  We'll see what ultimately happens, but the little ones are our first priority.  Even better that the 3 year old was throwing up a week ago and the 1 year old contracted pink eye yesterday.  It's all go!"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, we'll be doing that for a bit, then perhaps buying a marketplace plan or signing up for a very cheap plan simply for the discounts and pay out of pocket."
HealthInsurance,"I'll keep this in mind.   I haven't looked into Medicaid yet, but I'll have time soon....  :)"
HealthInsurance,"Interesting.   I saw that with the cheap plan, but the real draw for me  is the low price of $180 combined with reduced rates and catastrophic coverage.  Our Doctors charge about ~150/visit out of pocket, so if that rate is negotiated to half under the plan, one visit will have covered about 1/3 of the amount for the month.  Conversely, if there is a big event, I'll still see some discounts as well as get *some* coverage.     The fact that an Obamacare plan costs about $1500/mo leads me down the rabbit hole of 3 months * $1500 = $4500.   $4500 - $180*3 ~$3900.  So in three months I have accrued $3900 in savings which I can use the pay any event in the unlikely event it happens."
HealthInsurance,They likely did. Submit it again. Generally an appeal will be reviewed by a different doctor so even if its the same letter word for word it will still be read by a different person
HealthInsurance,"I have to say, I'm always more comfortable with this strategy for someone who's single &amp; in the pink of health. When children are involved I trend more conservative.

Be careful out there... &amp; good luck"
HealthInsurance,"The doctor should put key words like you have attacks greater than 14 days a month despite being on imitrex, and use of x, y, z. That it will be administered in medical office every 3 months and patient agrees to return for follow up labs and exams."
HealthInsurance,"Open enrollment is closed for the year (ended December 15th in most places), so you're going to need a special qualifying event (marriage, divorce, move, etc) to be able to enroll for an ACA compliant plan this year."
HealthInsurance,"Agreed.  The obamacare plans are in our scope at this point.  Expense, yes, but half the cost of COBRA.   Agreed that if it were just me, I would do without.   I haven't needed a doctor in over a year.... that's not to say something can't crop up, but I don't have chronic issues, either.
 
Thanks, I appreciate it.  Good luck to you as well!"
HealthInsurance,"You get the tax credit in a year sum dished  out monthly to your chosen insurance company directly thro out the year.

Whatever amount you don’t use towards your monthly insurance premium, you get back at the end of the year as a tax credit.

There is a lot of confusion with how it works.  
Simple terms, you get help with paying the monthly cost of insurance in your area based off your application.  The insurance company sets a monthly price for plans in your area and submits those to marketplace/healthcare.gov

You browse and pick a plan, and the government says you get X dollars amount to help you save on that cost or help pay the monthly insurance premium.

So you chose a $500 a month plan, your application says your eligible for a $450 tax credit.  The “help or credit” didn’t cover the set monthly insurance premium, meaning, you have to pay the difference each month. In this case $50 for a $500 plan.

Now on the other side, say the plan costs $500 a month and your eligible for a $1000 tax credit.  That more then covers it. So that means you won’t pay any monthly premium for your insurance. And you will get that left over $500 monthly credit back at the end of year when you file your taxes.



"
HealthInsurance,"Call your insurance company.  
Many times they will only authorize which ever is cheaper.  30 day supply or 90 day.  Which ever can save them money.  If you were getting a 90 day supply, call them and see what changed.

Odd guess here but year just changed, and many insurance companies are trying to get users to switch to mail order 90 day supply thro their pharmacy. Rather then having you go to local store and getting it filled.  


Strongly recommend calling your insurance company and seeing what options you have in order for you to get a 90 day supply."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for the reply. I will give my insurance company a call. "
HealthInsurance,"NC Department of Insurance has a department that helps with appeals. "
HealthInsurance,Oh great! Thank you!
HealthInsurance,Great! Thank you!!
HealthInsurance,"Did you get an EOB? Typically they will tell you why it was denied on the EOB.... if you post a copy we maybe able to help you. "
HealthInsurance,"That's not how insurance works. 

What do you mean it's not covering it? Do you mean the services are being denied, or that it is not free?

Preventive care is all that's covered at 100%. Other services are subject to your deductible and cost-sharing. 

"
HealthInsurance,"My advice is to call your insurance company and explain the situation. I'll share my personal experience where something similar happened. When my son was born, he was in the NICU at an in network hospital, he was there for two weeks, thought nothing of it. Once the bills started coming in I saw a large bill for a provider that had seen him that was out of network. I was a little taken aback, but I was in the medical insurance field so had enough confidence to call my insurance to see what my options were. I pled my case to them and said basically, I made sure I was at an in network hospital and I had no control over the doctors they were sending in left and right. To my pleasant surprise they agreed with me, and made an exception to change the billing to in network. So long story short, call and explain what happened and they may be able to help you out."
HealthInsurance,...and dental care isn't going to be covered under a medical plan either.
HealthInsurance,"Are you sure they didn't have a payroll system that you could log into, like adp?"
HealthInsurance,"Losing coverage due to turning 26 is a qualifying event under COBRA. She has 60 days to enroll from the notice date for coverage retro to the loss date. She should contact the hr/benefits department to inquire about it. Once coverage has been reinstated under COBRA, any claims can be resubmitted."
HealthInsurance,"Oh ok, so when you say the coverage is retro, it'll cover the office visit I mentioned? (If it's done before 60 days are up)
Thanks"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Are they entitled to having received some notice 

Yep. And the plan sponsor - that's likely her employer, or a vendor handling admin of their health plan - is obliged to send it to her. And the 60 day period she has to elect that coverage begins **on the day she receives the notice** - NOT when employer/vendor sends it.

She has 60 days to decide to elect coverage, another 45 to pay, and the coverage is retroactive to the date it was lost"
HealthInsurance,"Yes, it should but please confirm with HR or the COBRA administrator."
HealthInsurance,alright super thanks
HealthInsurance,"Looks pretty sweet. EPOs generally have tight networks - have you checked that any/all clinicians/facilities you might like to get treatment from are in-network? &amp; I don't see Rx benefits - are they in there?

Anyway, I'd read it as your max OOP for a year is $6k, after which plan pays 100% of covered charges. Ahhh, but - there's still the matter of how Rx are covered, &amp; if they'd come under that $6k umbrella....


More general question because I'm nosy: does your employer provide all kinds of snazzy easy-to-use lookup tools to enable you to do that kind of clinician/facility/Rx coverage research?"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the reply. So, it's a 2 level plan. After checking, if I add level 2, it's $110 biweekly, which will allow us to keep our doctors. Rx is fine, $12/24/36. 

But I'm reading this as since there is no deductible or coinsurance, and copays count toward the OOP max, I would only ever be paying copays. Is that not right? 

My current plan is no deductible/coinsurance, no OOP max and all I've ever paid was copays. I paid about $3900 last year in premiums and it will be about $4700 this year. Whereas this EPO would be about $2600."
HealthInsurance,"You may have coverage under (the child) under Medicaid for the time prior being added to parents insurance. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I'm reading this as since there is no deductible or coinsurance, and copays count toward the OOP max, I would only ever be paying copays. Is that not right?

yes, though I'd double check that the OOP max puts  a ceiling on your Rx as well as everything else."
HealthInsurance,"they will cover  normal checkups....surgery service denied 
dental is under obama care      cleaning free 
plaque removal denied 
no point in getting the teeth cleaned is plaque on them "
HealthInsurance,dental is under obamacare and some health insurances   my old one had it
HealthInsurance,"What was the reason for the denial? "
HealthInsurance,"I work at a large health insurance company and we have a policy that pertains to this type of situation. I don't know if your company has a similar policy, but it's worth a try to call them and try to adjust the claim. 

At our company, if a member goes out of network and it's not their fault, we cover it. So basically, if they went to their in network provider and lab work gets sent off to an out of network lab, but the member has no way of knowing that was going to happen, it's covered. Or if you're unconscious after an accident, and the ambulance brings you to an out of network hospital, you're covered because you had no way of choosing a different hospital."
HealthInsurance,"they just don’t cover it at all "
HealthInsurance,"they just don’t cover it at all "
HealthInsurance,"Ok. Allow me to run 2 scenarios by you, if you will. 

We had a baby under our current plan. 

No deductible/coinsurance, no OOPMax, $100/day inpatient (5/yr max)

Bill: $300

New plan:

No deductible/coinsurance, $6000 OOPMax, $100/day inpatient (5/yr max)

Bill: $300? 

Does this mean if I somehow reach $6k in copays (which seems impossible) I no longer pay copays for care? The no deductible is making me assume full coverage from dollar one. Which is giving me basically the same coverage (a few copays are slightly higher) for like $2k less a year, and I can't understand why they would do this."
HealthInsurance,"Most health plans under ACA are just medical. If they do have dental included it’s mainly just preventative. Same with the standalone dental plans. They are mainly preventative, cleanings , fillings, etc. 

I have seen very few that actually cover restorative and other services.

Your best bet is to call up your dental insurance company and speak to them about what your plan covers and can do for you.

As for medical coverage, once you choose a plan, your “locked in” for the year. Unless you have a qualifying life event, your cannot change plans. Hence why shopping for a plan is very important as it will be your plan or coverage for the year.

You can’t be on a plan, use it for whatever you needed, and drop it/switch plans to something cheaper for rest of year. It doesn’t work that way.

When you signed up for “Obamacare/ACA/marketplace” for the year, they should have been able to explain what plans and benefits each one had for you."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Does this mean if I somehow reach $6k in copays (which seems impossible) I no longer pay copays for care?

Yep - based on what you've provided.

Tell you what. I respect your skepticism about this thing that looks ""too good to be true"". Let's take 1 other step to confirm it. 

De-identify a copy of your Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) and post a link here. [SBCs look like this](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf). Your employer or insurer is obliged to provide you this ""nutrition label for health plans"". Page 1 should have the information we need to confirm. Either me or others here will be able to scan it &amp; confirm for you. 

re: 

&gt; employer is offering a new EPO

is the insurer behind this plan new to your employer? Sometimes an insurer, or plan administrator, or maybe a health system that's introducing its own brand of health insurance, will price their wares at too good to be true prices - they'll ""buy business"" to secure a (they hope) long-term relationship. A $2k/employee ""discount"" seems steep, but who knows anymore, many people believed a company whose business model was bulit on selling little tiny text ads would never amount to anything...."
HealthInsurance,"thanks for the reply! cleared it up.   have a great day "
HealthInsurance,Sweet! Thanks!
HealthInsurance,"Not that I’m aware of, but I’ll ask if I need to! Thank you!"
HealthInsurance,"If it's just an office visit though, the COBRA premium is likely to cost more than the visit."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, appreciate the time."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I had our first child and two of our claims with Humana were denied in December (this was a newborn preventative weight check and another preventative exam) prior to when he was added to our insurance - but within the 30 days newborn period.

This can be a bit hard to sort out, but if you have coverage through an employer, the timing of a) notifying your employer of the birth b) employer updating their enrollment records c) employer transmitting info to insurer d) insurer incorporating new info into its processing of open claims, and maybe  claims that were generated *after* the fact of a new eligible but *before* they got notice of coverage via ""official"" channels can cause claims processing miscues.

So, to confirm: a) coverage for baby is via employer? if so b) you notified employer to put baby on as dependent? c) you followed up with insurer to confirm baby's a covered dependent, even if insurer reports they haven't gotten notification of the newborn, so they can note &amp; process claim correctly?

"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you everyone for all your advice so far! I started with the doctors office, where the assistant was unfortunately no help. The lady at the counter I had called sounded like she got nervous &amp; scared and asked I call everyone else before following up. Oh well.

I next called my insurance company as recommended which seemed to be much more fruitful. I had pointed out claims from the doctor (which were in network) and the claim for the lab, which they were able to tie to the in-network doctor billing for blood draw services. They mentioned this looked pretty odd and that it certainly looks like I did everything right. They sent my claim back to the adjusters with this information, but said it may take a while (up to 30 days). The insurance provider from my work though said she would be calling every other week to check in though.  Fingers crossed this shakes out better!"
HealthInsurance,"Excellent.  Just fyi just make sure you have a ""number"" for this issue; makes it easier to track."
HealthInsurance,"Hey, so I want to make sure that you applied for Medicaid correctly.  Do you supply 50.00000001% of your own support?  In that instance, you should apply as a household of one - in which case only your income should be counted."
HealthInsurance,"The plan looks legit, but just to be safe, post the SBC"
HealthInsurance,"An agent will help you understand your options, and can guide you through your state's exchange.  You don't have to pay him; the insurance company gives him a small commission.  "
HealthInsurance,"It's included in some insurance plans on the exchange, but dental is *not* one of the 10 essential health benefits.  The full list is [here](https://www.aarp.org/health/health-insurance/info-08-2013/affordable-care-act-health-benefits.html)."
HealthInsurance,"Ok, you're going to need to call your health insurer and get them to pull the Novixus number.  Normally, the information on the card is correct."
HealthInsurance,"Do you have an update for us?  If, as a member stated below, that MM requires step therapy, your doctor might want to start there and/or appeal.

Have they paid for these particular med before?"
HealthInsurance,I wouldn't be surprised if it takes over 30 days. But just hold your ground and don't pay for that service out of pocket. If the provider turns it to collections or it causes you financial hardship they can put it in priority queue for adjustment.
HealthInsurance,"I dunno what to call it exactly, it was a visit but some things were performed. The bill was about $1000"
HealthInsurance,"One wasn't included in the materials I received yesterday. It may be on the website, but I'm in the field at the moment. 

This is a new option they're offering this year and so far, it looks like I can get the same coverage as my HMO for $2k less in premium fees with slightly higher PCP and urgent care copays. Also in an expanded network. 

Im thinking I'm understanding this correctly, but I'm skeptical as hell because this is America, and they don't just cut a major bill for you by like 40% lol. Especially since my existing HMO is going up about $800. 

Some reps are coming Monday to discuss the plan with us, I was just going over the material I received yesterday."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah....an EPO is almost always more expensive than an HMO...

make sure you get a SBC."
HealthInsurance,I just found one today! Thanks!
HealthInsurance,"I'm not sure what that even means. I cover the entirety of just the rent. Dad covers all the utilities. He pays his own gas and car payments and we alternate groceries. "
HealthInsurance,"Look into short term health insurance. What it sounds like you're asking for is a way to cheat the system. The system is smarter than you, so no, there isn't a way to pay $500 a month to cover $5,000 worth of procedures and then switch back to your $50 a month insurance."
HealthInsurance,"Ok...basically, if we took all the money that it costs for you to be you, and divided it by the amount of money you make, would that number be 50% or greater?"
HealthInsurance,"You need to talk to a personal injury lawyer.  They usually take a commission; you don't pay them, the settlement/judgement does."
HealthInsurance,So the bills I have to pay or else I go homeless? Greater in that case.... I only really have rent and student loans as of right now.
HealthInsurance,"Alright; so that means that you are an independent household.  Apply as yourself only, without your father's income.  

I also need to know what state you live in."
HealthInsurance,Rhode island and oh ok?
HealthInsurance,"Excellent.  Rhode Island expanded Medicaid, so as long as you make $29700 or less you're eligible for medicaid or Rite-care."
HealthInsurance,That's pretty cool! I'll look into it after work.
HealthInsurance,I'll dig around on the site later.
HealthInsurance,"I've had this issue before with clients and have made the doctor's office pay the bill and/or had the lab write it off. You did your job and went to an in-network facility, they were lazy and sent off the lab work to an out-of-network facility. It's their fault."
HealthInsurance,"As a piggyback to your comment, all the EPO's I've been dealing with have the same exact network and in-network benefit as the PPO counterpart, just no out of network coverage. These are plans offered through Aetna and UHC in Texas."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; all the EPO's I've been dealing with have the same exact network and in-network benefit as the PPO counterpart, just no out of network coverage. These are plans offered through Aetna and UHC in Texas.

thanks for sharing that,dunno about anyone else but that is helpful market intel for me - do you think they differ at all in how doctors/hospitals are compensated? Are there ANY differences in premiums/plan design/etc  that consumers would feel directly?"
HealthInsurance,"I couldn't speak on how doctors and hospitals are compensated since I've never gotten into that with the carriers, but I would imagine not since these plans also have the same benefits as their PPO counterparts. The difference is in premium--they are anywhere from 4 - 8% cheaper than the PPO counterpart. The only thing is there is no out of network coverage, but to compensate for this we stress doing employee education through enrollment meets or sending out e-mails or whatever along with documents that have instructions on finding in-network doctors to make sure they know they need to go in-network. The good thing is, both of the plan offerings by both Aetna and UHC that we're selling use their largest networks so it usually isn't an issue. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;does Cobra cover EXACTLY the same things if no longer employed.

You're continuing coverage that active employees have, &amp; paying up to 102% of the actual premium cost of that coverage. - which may be severalfold more than you paid in contributions for the coverage as an active employee.

Secondly, your former employer may change their coverage after you leave, and as  a continuee your coverage would change as well. 

So - be careful out there"
HealthInsurance,"I called Insurance company to inquire about reason why it wasn't covered and they said it was a computer glitch, they have been seeing quite of few of these and she would send it to ""adjustments"", the claim status hasn't changed online but I assume it takes a bit to process and or update in the system."
HealthInsurance,"Ahh, I see. Thank you"
HealthInsurance,"It’s a group plan (I’m a teacher). From what I’ve seen, usually it’s only not covered under individual plans, right?"
HealthInsurance,"1. No, absolutely not the doctor's responsibility. There are literally thousands of medical procedures and thousands of insurance plans. It's not a menu at McDonald's where they know immediately how mcuh a Big Mac is. Ask their business office for an estimate before any expensive procedures in the future.

2. The charge you're referring to is for the actual radiologist to interpret the scans you received. It's not unusual if that's what you're asking, but many places have their own in-house radiologists.

3. Since you have insurance, no. Some disreputable places will attempt to negotiate, but it's a violation of their contract with your insurance and doing so could jeopardize their continued participation.

4. You don't have an 'MRI deductible'. You have a deductible that all covered procedures (less certain preventative care that is covered at no cost regardless) count towards. Until you meet your deductible, insurance only saves you money by getting you a negotiated rate with an in-network provider. After you've met your deductible, they will pay on covered procedures and you would only owe coinsurance. For some perspective, a $1,750 deductible for a single patient is not bad for a HDHP.

5. Set up a payment plan. Ask for an estimate from your provider's business office before getting any complex procedures. Ask if they have an in-house lab or if they must send samples out. If so, ask who they use so that you can check if your insurance is in-network before pulling the trigger."
HealthInsurance,"Preexisting conditions are really only a concern for short-term plans, you should be good to go. Add her within 60 days of getting married or you'll lose out on the special enrollment period."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. Much appreciated. "
HealthInsurance,"My pleasure. I'm sorry about the surprise bill, I hope in the future things become more transparent for patients but I think there will have to be a huge reform in the way our country handles things before then. 

The best you can do is be a strong advocate for yourself. My personal experience is that providers will work with you to find solutions to lower your costs, but you have to put that bug in their ear or else they are only going to think about doing what's best for your health."
HealthInsurance,"Good news is that it's just the beginning of the year. Now with your deductible out of the way, for the rest of the year, everything will be much cheaper."
HealthInsurance,"You insurance company has access to general health information including what treatment was provided  (CPT codes), diagnoses (ICD-10 codes), medications, and summaries or discussions needed to justify billing or payment of the submitted services. HIPAA law ideally would protect your medical information because you are 19. Unfortunately every insurance company will differ in their policies regarding release of information to the person purchasing the plan or subscriber of the policy. There are a few things that you can do to ensure you are the only one receiving the information. Call your insurance &amp; ask what their policy is on sharing your claim information with other people on the plan. If you live at an alternate address ask that they update your address so the claims summaries (EOB's) are mailed only to you. Also remember to clarify what information your parents can view online when they log in to the insurance website. That is the most common way that people have access to other family members medical information.  I am sure there are several more preventive measures you can take. I will reply again if I think of some more! "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you so much, I appreciate all the info! "
HealthInsurance,"If you're under a commercial health insurance plan, you need to access medical care in the geography where you live and got the plan. The plan will have a network of doctors and hospitals (available online or via mail by request) that you can see. Some plans have multiple networks you can access at different costs. 

If you are not in your home geography, but still in the U.S., your health plan will cover emergency care and prescription refills only. You will have to return to your home geography for routine or non-emergent care. 

"
HealthInsurance,"That's correct. Assuming your stepdad has you on commercial insurance through work, he can only add or remove dependents during his open enrollment period. Those changes are then in effect for the next entire calendar year. 

He would only be able to drop you if you receive other coverage of your own. There are certain other criteria like if you were to turn 26, but I don't think any of them apply in your situation (you can google ""qualifying events for special enrollment period"" to see all of them)."
HealthInsurance,"Charge for a birth is usually a set fee for all prenatal visits plus the delivery and post-natal care. If it was something outside of this (like a procedure to address a complication) that would be extra. For example, if the insurance bill said the doctor checked you twice following the delivery but you had them correct that he only actually visited you once, that won't change the total cost. 

What was the itemized charge you had them remove? "
HealthInsurance,Do you live with someone else or is your household just you?
HealthInsurance,I live with a roommate
HealthInsurance,"So then your household income isn't $0, assuming they are covering your rent/food."
HealthInsurance,"You can call the insurance company and request your ID card &amp; update your new address so all medical correspondence goes to you, not to your stepdad/family. "
HealthInsurance,"You may want to contact the insurance again and ask them to verify if your plan allows out of network providers to be paid as in network when the services are ordered by an in network provider. A lot of plans now have that due to the fact that you obviously can't verify a physician/facility that you don't know is providing services. (anesthesia, radiology interpretation, lab, etc) "
HealthInsurance,"No. Thankfully, this is no longer the case. On any aca-compliant plan, which includes all plans sold on the exchange, whether or not something is a pre-existing condition does not matter, and will be covered. The only time that pregnancy is not covered, is if you are on what is called a short-term plan, AKA, not real insurance."
HealthInsurance,"Okay, just before I start to answer your question, I do have to ask you a question. You used the term migrant. Does that mean that you move around the country a lot, or that you are here on a Visa. Also, if you are in fact not a native of this country, are you documented? Again, I hate to ask, but your use of the term migrant makes it an issue, and the circumstances can vary drastically depending."

HealthInsurance,"I am from Minnesota but work all across the country.  I only spend december and January at home. "
HealthInsurance,"Ok, sorry, just checking.  Tell me about your health....is it good, or do you just need the occasional RX and maybe an urgent care visit. (btw, urgent care is usually covered nation-wide).

Are we looking at an individual policy or a work provided plan..."
HealthInsurance,"Ya, I wouldn't worry about the larger bill, setting up a payment plan is what a lot of people do."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Surely pregnancy isn’t considered a pre-existing condition, right? 

Beezy's 1st reply was correct, but maybe a bit confusing. Your wife's pregnancy IS  a pre-existing condition, but it will NOT impact your ability to have her covered, for the pregnancy or anything else."
HealthInsurance,"not to throw a 90-degree turn into your calculations or anything, but you *might* want to find out how much parents have to contribute to keep you on dad's plan monthly. That amount MAY be greater than any amount YOU as a now-independent individual might have to pay, with/without premium tax credits, for coverage that suits your situation.

My secret agenda is finding a way to turn this divisive issue into something that shows folks you're capable of being on your own, AND that being on your own may be financially advantageous for everyone.

So what you do is first price what individual coverage might cost you on your own. We can help but you need to provide details, because all health coverage is ""local"". Your city/state, your expected annual income, any health stuff that might require you to need to pay for regular MD visits, etc.

Once you have that info, AND info on dependent contributions for parent's plan, you can show them how - or whether - keeping you on their plan is a good or not-as-good thing."
HealthInsurance,I work festivals for multiple companies so there is nothing there to help me.  My health is generally good but I have developed the symptoms for a uti or kidney infection so I paid for tests that all came up negative.  The Dr wants me to get a ct scan and I think it was an ultrasound?  I would have to look.
HealthInsurance,"you can appeal directly to your insurance company.  it is a very specific form and paperwork.  Do it.  If you havent received a letter that explains your rights, call customer service and tell them that you would like to file a formal appeal and they will help you with the first steps"
HealthInsurance,"There’s no way to know without knowing what the coordination type is of the secondary plan. The fact that the first plan would put patient responsibility toward the deductible doesn’t in any way preclude the secondary from paying. I’ve seen it many times. If you have the spare time, you could call out to the secondary and see if they can provide some insight. We always try to provide as much transparency where I work, and since we can provide contracted rates over the phone we can run through some scenarios where “if the primary allows X, we’ll process on...”"

HealthInsurance,"Sadly, I know exactly what they're dealing with. I joined Reddit a few minutes ago, because I have the same concerns. I'm 62, pay $996/month for insurance, my husband (thank God) is now on Medicare, I've worked in healthcare so I'm pretty familiar with this mess. I think that they will NOT qualify for any subsidies or tax credit due to the pension and social security. They can NOT quickly sign up for insurance in the event of an emergency. It doesn't work like that. They do NOT need to purchase an RX card. There are several out there, such as GoodRX that are free. With my insurance I get a discount on my drugs, but I don't have a drug plan per se. I have used GoodRx, when I left my meds at home during a trip and saved money. You can't have an HSA unless you have an HSA/HDHP. No HDHP, no HSA contriibutions. I'm surprised the're paying only $2K a month, in WI, depending on their zip code, it would be a bit higher. And NO, it is NOT good insurance. For my $966/month I get a $7350 deductible and NO, yes NO coverage outside of the 19 counties in WI that Aurora Healthcare is in. Everything else is Out Of Network. There is ""emergency care"", but it only covers the ER with lots of loopholes and NOTHING if I'm admitted. I'm going to start a different thread, as liek Gooberfaced said, when we leave those 19 counties, which of course we do when we drive 2 hours to see our daughter or take a vacation, any medical emergency could potentially bankrupt us. I've been trying to figure this out for two weeks.

I can't believe that I've actually considered the same thing, but IF something were to happen, I think that the stress of the bills and the debt collectors would add to their problems.

HealthInsurance,"I hope you realize you can't get health insurance outside of open enrollment (which has passed) unless you have ""qualifying life events"" such as losing a job, divorce etc. "

HealthInsurance,"Appreciate the answer, and the link. Good resource there! Will sign up tomorrow. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you so much for all your help. I was really hoping there was a way for my friend to separate themselves from this but like you said, if the parents want their info bad enough they can get it. We're probably gonna have to have a conversation with the police about it eventually either way and whether insurance is what triggers it or not doesn't matter too much.

I have one more question - when the plan is up for renewal during AEP, is the parent going to have to actively say ""i want my child kept on"" or will they have to actively say ""i want my child taken off"", whichever they decide to do? Which one is assumed?"
HealthInsurance,"Yes. From a licensed health insurance agent/broker licensed in PA. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks so much for reading and responding, I really appreciate it. That's good to know, and I'll try researching some of that further."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;it was so barebones as to be worthless, especially considering that money is already tight, doubly so during the six week-long enrollment period.

1) Your premium (subsidized or not) purchases your insurer's promise to pay some or all of your bills should you need specified treatments, which is a handy promise to have in hand if you're hit by a bus or diagnosed with a condition the treatment for which would cost you tens of thousands of dollars. ACA policies do cover preventive checkups/screenings at no cost *before* any deductibles are applied, but maybe that kind of thing isn't of use to you.


2) money being ""tight"" *during* the enrollment period seems kind of moot given that your elections during the enrollment period take effect weeks *later*.
"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I see no issues with this

There are  a *lot* of issues with this, as others have pointed out &amp; even OP realizes.

One not mentioned yet is that when dad becomes Medicare eligible, that's great for dad - but mom's still 2 more years from Medicare eligibility, and dad's eligibility does precisely squat for her."
HealthInsurance,"all health coverage is local - your options, &amp; their costs, are highly dependent on your ""local"" circumstances including 

- place (city, state)
- health status
- expected 2018 income

Provide specifics and you may score some specific, actionable replies. But while we're at it, it's kind of unlikely you won't find non-market policies that check all your boxes, particularly price"

HealthInsurance,"&gt;is there a plan that covers type 2 diabetes?

Any marketplace plan covers treatments for type 2 diabetes."
HealthInsurance,"Does the indemnity plan offering satisfy both MEC &amp; MV? Could be an issue for your tax credit eligibility. From p-hat's source:

&gt;Is all employer-sponsored insurance required to meet the affordability and minimum value tests?


&gt;No, not every plan an employer offers is required to meet the affordability and minimum value tests. For example, an employer could offer three plans: Plan 1 that meets both affordability and minimum value, Plan 2 with comprehensive benefits but high premiums that is not considered affordable for all employees, and Plan 3 that has very low premiums but limited coverage that fails to meet minimum value. The employer can offer, and the employee can select, any of these plans. Regardless of which plan employees choose, they will not qualify for premium tax credits in the Marketplace because the employer offers at least one plan (Plan 1) that meets both affordability and minimum value. For the employee, any employer plan he accepts qualifies as minimum essential coverage to meet his obligation to obtain coverage, even if the plan’s benefits don’t meet the minimum value test."
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"The [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/employers/health-coverage-providers-understanding-minimum-essential-coverage)  says “Minimum essential coverage does not include fixed indemnity coverage, life insurance or dental or vision coverage.” I’m actually not sure whether a plan can be MV without being MEC...

EDIT: OK, looking at the [regulations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.36B-2), OP you should still be good. It says "". An applicable taxpayer (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section) is **allowed a premium assistance amount** only for any month that one or more members of the applicable taxpayer's family (the applicable taxpayer or the applicable taxpayer's spouse or dependent) -

(1) Is enrolled in one or more qualified health plans through an Exchange; and

(2) **Is not eligible for minimum essential coverage** (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section) other than coverage described in section 5000A(f)(1)(C) (relating to coverage in the individual market)."""
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  Is not eligible for minimum essential coverage 

Right. And do we know the indemnity plan does not provide MEC, and is one of those ""fixed"" indemnity plans the regs talk about? (Have to admit I'm not sure what that would be.... sounds like a plan that pays set dollar amounts for named treatments, kind of like an old-timey ""schedule"" plan)

HealthInsurance,"some of the larger companies have carve outs for diabetics, where they give you discounts on meds and testing equipment if you are getting your labs done on time and seeing the Dr regularly.  it can be a big cost savings.  A local broker (independent insurance agent) might be able to help you figure out what, if anything, is available in your area and your price range.  You might also have to contact companies directly too, and deal with their sales people.  If you are using insulin and testing frequently, it might be worth it.  BTW the name for these types of programs is Disease Management (DM) and they are most common for diabetes, but also not unusual for asthma and CHF"
HealthInsurance,That varies depending how the employer handles their enrollment.  Mine assumes no changes and keeps everything the same unless you change something.  But it could go either way.
HealthInsurance,"Call the insurance company. Ask them to walk you through the eob (explanation of benefits). Take down the call number. 

Call again. Say you have the eob breakdown and call number and ask about your out of pocket.

It may be that one or more things were not ""covered"" by the insurance and does not count towards your out of pocket max and deductible.

Read your insurance plan over again. Upload it here so some redditors can figure it out for you."
HealthInsurance,"Yes, no health issues as stated in original post. I have time to get approved - pming you"
HealthInsurance,"I'm not eligible for ACA. I won't post my income publicly, but I'm over the ~48k income maximum. 

26 M no medications/no health issues


""it's kind of unlikely you won't find non-market policies that check all your boxes, particularly price"" - you are saying I should look for a lower price? "
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, it is one of those fixed indemnity plans, and they specifically state that it isn't MEC. Definitely not MV either, but there's no SBC (I'm assuming because it's not ""real"" insurance?). 

Basically, you fill out a claim and you get $x for y service, up to a max. "
HealthInsurance,"Forget for a second what you actually paid already. Find all of your EOBs and add up the parts you owe.  Is it over $6000?  If not you need to see where the money should be paid vs where you already paid it. If it's over $6000 something's probably wrong or someone was out of network. Everything you need will be in the EOBs.

If you paid a bill before it was processed by insurance it may have been paid by both you and them leaving you a credit with the provider you paid. This sometimes happens when bills for services aren't processed in the order the services were done. Some providers wait a certain time before submitting claims. 

You should not have to pay a $7000 bill to meet a $6000 deductible. Once you reach $6000 everything else should be covered 100%. I assume they meant you had to pay on the larger bill to finish meeting your deductible."
HealthInsurance,"It goes from the date you paid the bill, unfortunately."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; With the out-of-pocket maximum I must pay the complete bill in which the out-of-pocket maximum is reached before the out-of-pocket maximum goes into effect. At the time the hospitalization bill was processed, I still had $2,300 left to go for my out-of-pocket maximum. So, according to my insurance company, I am responsible for the full $7,000 of the bill rather than just $3,700 ($6,000 - $2,300) and any subsequent bill after the $7,000 one will be covered at 100% since now my out-of-pocket maximum has been met.  

That's wrong. $6000 out of pocket max means just that. You should have had to pay on that $7000 bill until your $6k OOM was met, and then the insurance should pick up the rest. It doesn't matter what order the bills come in."
HealthInsurance,"sorry - I mis-typed.

I should have written 'it's kind of unlikely that you WILL find' lower priced non-market policies that fit your needs"
HealthInsurance,"ok, so BOTH employer-offered plans are non-compliant. That sounds like good news for you, as far as qualifying for tax credits if you buy your own market coverage. 

I'm back on partyhat's bandwagon!"
HealthInsurance,"Unfortunately, any non-ACA plan you are able to get now won't get you out of paying the tax fine next year. Just something to factor in."
HealthInsurance,"So I have to pay the 2.5% total income fee for ""being uninsured"" AND pay for health insurance? I'm currently on an ACA plan but am losing the tax break because my income changed, that's why I need to switch. It's cheaper for me to get a private plan than to pay the full price for the plan I'm on right now from the government marketplace"
HealthInsurance,What state do you live in?
HealthInsurance,Texas
HealthInsurance,"Step 1.  Call your insurance company and explain what to said above.  See if there is anything that can be done.

They may be able and they may just say tough luck , call marketplace.


Step 2.   Call marketplace.  Explain same as above, explain that you already spoke to insurance company and they didn’t notify you at all about payment.   Make sure to emphasize you had every intention of paying the premium before it was due but never heard anything from the insurance company.


The representative should at that point be happy to send up an escalation.  

Do not ask for one.

Now if they do submit one, it can take up to 30 days for anything to actually happen.  (Most times it’s 3-4 days or a week, just depends on your insurance company) don’t freak out. 

Next if they approve the reactivation, you will have to pay any past due amounts to get to current status or whatever the insurance company says they are willing to do.   They don’t have to do anything, you failed to make a payment and they can basically tell you tough luck.

Hope you can get it resolved.



Edit:  yes I know you already called but this is an option.  Usually failure to pay means your screwed and cannot get it back.   The key parts are “ I didn’t receive anything from my insurance company to pay a bill, they never kept me informed, etc”


This isn’t a sure fire way to get it back, it’s only an option that may or may not work for you "
HealthInsurance,"ACA plans ARE private plans. But yes, if you go with a non-aca compliant plan, you would still have to pay the fine. And you likely can't get a new ACA plan at this point  because open enrollment is closed for 2018. You would need a qualifying event such as getting married, moving, etc to be able to get a new plan through the exchange now."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, we try to be really transparent too but it's difficult since we don't run into secondary insurance very often (when we do it's usually medicaid as secondary so no pt responsibility) and when I call insurance companies to ask about coordination of benefits most of the phone reps are clueless. If primary does put it toward deductible though, what reason would secondary have for paying?
What do you usually ask when you call (ex. key words)? You mentioned ""coordination type"" ...what do you mean by that? "
HealthInsurance,"Nice clarification of how plans can differ. All marketplace plans cover, but plans can differ in how they serve diabetics (or members with other chronic conditions)."
HealthInsurance,"No, it is where the provider would send claims for payment. It's usually on the back of your insurance card, or you can call and ask for the claims address. "
HealthInsurance,"This is called a COB issue, or coordination of benefits. It's who pays primary and who pays secondary. Even if you only give one insurance to the provider, it still might deny as other insurance primary. I would recommend calling school insurance first to confirm they are primary, then call parents insurance to confirm they are secondary. You may need to get them all in a conference call but once it's fixed it should be good from there on out. "
HealthInsurance,"The joint doesn't and will probably never file on insurance. Their packages/plans though are something you might consider, mines is about 60$ for 4 visits a month."
HealthInsurance,I talked to 2 insurance agents today and they said the same. Seems like I'm stuck with a 500$/mo individual insurance plan. Expensive lesson - now I see why people with money say ACA sucks.
HealthInsurance,"And at that point, they get a policy just for her if necessary.

If they’re healthy and say, only going in for yearly check-ups... yeah, why pay out for a policy that’s not even going to pay for that yearly because they aren’t meeting the deductible?

Pay OOP for visits when necessary, hit up Urgent care for antibiotic scripts when needed.

By not having insurance, they can offer to pay cash for the visits and more than likely the office will knock off 30-40% .

- I’ve done this when I didn’t have insurance.
-I work in healthcare.

For healthy people, it’s a gamble... sure.  But that’s why Obamacare is such a disaster.  People like this should be free to purchase the plan that fits their lives."
HealthInsurance,"Your explanation of benefits would provide you with the information to appeal. Your state department of insurance has information to assist, too. Your insurance documents or formulary list will also give you an idea of why it's being denied. It could be that it's considered a higher level/tier medication that falls under a more expensive rate table. Still unfortunate, but cheaper than outright. Being persistent is key. The insurance company is counting on people getting lost in the jargon or giving up in frustration. 

If you're on a self funded health plan, exceptions can be made if you appeal to your employer. Your HR department can help you, too. Besides helping you understand the benefits, they might help if getting the broker involved is warranted.

Lastly, you can check Good Rx for the cheapest prices around town. Also, consider checking if the medication is on the CVS/Walgreens/Walmart list for their in-house annual program (been a couple years since I've done this, not sure if it's still offered). "
HealthInsurance,"I did check the Goodrx website, and the prices are pretty much identical across the board, they did give me a card that had a very small amount off, but nothing noticible"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;My question is, am I legally able to get on the fully-insured health insurance out-of-state where the corporation is headquarted, or do I have to enroll in the self-insured insurance provided in my state?

You're able to enroll in whatever plan(s) your employer offers where you are. Typically an employer tries to devise a self-funded arrangement that's offered everywhere its employees live/work, and supplements that plan with additional options if it fits some strategic objective and/or fills a coverage hole (for example, where networks of clinicians/facilities used for the self-funded plan are thin). I feel like it's unlikely the HQ has ONLY a fully-insured plan for HQ staff; more likely HQ employees have the option to choose.


&gt; can I in general practice enroll in health insurance provided out-of-state or do I have to enroll in health insurance provided within my state?

""In general practice"", no. Insurance is regulated at the state level, and health insurance - the ""fully insured"" kind - is no different. Employers who self- fund technically aren't insuring coverage, and - well, let's not get into the niceties of that sometimes-alarming-to-employees little distinction. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"&gt;if a provider in Oregon says they take Cigna, does that mean I can get an HMO in California and it will be covered?

No.  Think of CIGNA as the brand name for an agglomeration of insurance companies (and other related businesses that are not in the business of writing insurance policies) that are legally distinct principally to satisfy state regulators of insurance. CIGNA writing health insurance in California is not the same entity, for the purpose of writing health insurance policies for people living in California, as CIGNA writing health insurance in Oregon for people living in Oregon. 


I know what you're thinking; ""this doesn't make any sense!""


You'll get no argument from me.

Now, you MIGHT be able to enroll Oregon son under a policy that provides you PPO coverage - but you might not, if he's permanently an Oregonian. There  are people here who can probably clear up that issue for you.  Meanwhile, have ex check what it would cost her to cover your son as a dependent on her employer-sponsored coverage (or whatever health coverage she has). Then, if that's more economically manageable, arrange to pay that share of the cost of coverage with her. Courts &amp; lawyers aren't too clueful about this kind of thing, so you may have to do some persuading if this is the most advantageous all-around solution; be firm, but persistent. This solution IS legal, it's just not what everyone would realize might be doable."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Due to changes in October of 2017 he was told today that Medicare will only cover one day of outpatient recovery and no nursing care recovery.

This doesn't sound right. Can you post any correspondence your dad got to document this? And are you talking about Medic*ARE* - generally for people 65 and older - or Medic**AID** - a different kettle of fish altogether."
HealthInsurance,"Can you contact the manufacturer of the medication and see if they can do something for you? "
HealthInsurance,I appreciate the insight. It really is overwhelming and confusing haha. I will have to talk to my ex to see if she is agreeable to it all. Thanks!
HealthInsurance,"So we are talking about employer funded health insurance, correct? What about removing the employer out of the equation. Am I legally able to skip enrollment in an employer funded plan and instead enroll in health insurance from a different state than the one I live in now?"
HealthInsurance,"A PPO would be the type to give you coverage across state lines. Usually HMOs provide 0 coverage for out of network services. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Am I legally able to skip enrollment in an employer funded plan and instead enroll in health insurance from a different state than the one I live in now?

Uhm...again, no. Is there a particular type of policy, offered only in another state, that causes you to be interested in this ""different state""  coverage? Because it's, uhm, an unlikely scenario."
HealthInsurance,"Yes, there is coverage for certain things guaranteed by state law for health insurance providers in other states. There are no laws in my state for these certain things being covered. I understand the scenario is unlikely, but what laws or statutes prevent me from getting insured through a provider in a different state?"
HealthInsurance,"Sorry for the delay here. IF Optum is involved (again, im guessing) then they would have sent a letter to your doctors office telling them why, and how to appeal. Your doctor wouldnt need to submit a claim to Optum, just a letter of appeal with the Kaiser denials attached. Optum could then instruct UHC to either stop the recovery request, or repay the claims if they are already refunded. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you so much! I will bring this up to our provider (who as far as I can tell just gave up immediately and starting asking us for money). 

I understand that the protocol wasn't followed (primary then secondary), but it seems like this is a little bit of a special case since it's a treatment clearly not covered at all by my wife's primary. Do you think that's true? Do you think we have a prayer here???

Thanks again for responding. I feel almost completely lost on this."
HealthInsurance,I think you have a shot but you're going to have to fight. Appealing everything is your best bet. Good luck! You can reply in here if you have any questions later on and ill try to keep an eye out
HealthInsurance,"There’s no specific number because it fluctuates with the federal poverty level. Your income has to be between 100%-400% of the federal poverty level to qualify for a subsidy. "
HealthInsurance,"They are asking for other options to sign up, not options to stay off."
HealthInsurance,"100% of the federal poverty level. $15,060 for 2017 for a single. 30,750 for a family of four."
HealthInsurance,Thank you!
HealthInsurance,I was trying to extend COBRA due to a family member disability (allows you to go an extra 11 months).  My former employer wasn't letting me.  The agency stepped in and called them and told them they had to let me extend.  I've never seen such a fabulous/quick response from the government.
HealthInsurance,"&gt; what laws or statutes prevent me from getting insured through a provider in a different state?

Insurers aren't going to write you a policy. It's about that simple. You don't live in the state where they're chartered to sell insurance.

Insurers are responsible for this state (pun intended) of affairs. If you've not heard of the concept of ""regulatory capture"", look it up.  This is the way they want their industry to be regulated. "
HealthInsurance,Thank you so much for your insight.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Am I understanding this correctly that it's 4k deductible (assuming I cover my family) and 14.3k max OOP?

sort of - but keep in mind if YOU meet the $2k deductible and YOU hit the $7,150 out-of-pocket cap, your plan's paying 100% of covered charges thereafter."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;If a child is covered under their parent's plan and no longer wants to be part of that arrangement, is the insurer required to remove them (during an election period if need be) whether the policy-holder is willing or not?

This is a good question. Rules pertaining to employer-sponsored coverage typically treat the employee on whose employment coverage is predicated as the ""boss"" of that coverage. I don't know, with respect to fully insured groups (as parents' plan in your situation probably is), whether an employee would have unilateral say in keeping a dependent on or off the coverage. I'm pretty sure they couldn't be forced to keep a dependent on coverage, but I'm not certan they would not have a say in whether a dependent's coverage is continued, particularly since they typically pay a fair portion of the premium cost.

I'm hoping one or more of our insurer-employed experts chimes in on this for you soon. "
HealthInsurance,"Note that even if your income winds up falling below that, you don’t have to repay anything. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for your help! Situation worked out differently than I expected, but this is good to know for the future.

I actually got a response from the company and they gave me a price of ~$40 for a 3-month supply. I guess the price shown on the website was per month (even though I definitely selected the 90 day supply, and just double checked). I have a preference for filling in-person anyway, so looks like I'll be doing off insurance and reimbursing to my HSA."
HealthInsurance,"I thought I had this all straightened out, but no.  The customer service people seem to be reading off scripts, as one of them told me today that the subsidies would have to be paid back, along with being unable to answer simple questions.  Thanks for your reply."
HealthInsurance,"FYI, Medicaid can pay up to 3 months of back medical bills. "
HealthInsurance,"A small side note - If your income is between 100% and 300% of the federal poverty limit you'll qualify for zero-cost sharing subsidy. "
HealthInsurance,"I mean, my taxes for the past year are withheld, so couldn't the IRS just take it out of them and make my refund smaller?

Can anyone confirm if this is accurate?"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the advice, I'll do that and report back!"
HealthInsurance,"They do. The IRS will see you owe them money with any future dealings with them, taxes etc. so in future if your owed any refunds, the IRS will simply take that and apply it to your past due for not having insurance.

They wouldn’t take anything from past filings, this would be going forward once they know you have to pay that fee.

For example, if you have a fee for 2017, and file in 2018, the irs will start looking for what’s owed to them starting in 2018 going forward.

"
HealthInsurance,"Hello. I am sorry to hear that you are not feeling well.

1.  Firstly, whether or not you are disabled will have nothing to do with whether or not you can get insurance. United States has changed its laws, and you are able to stay on your parents insurance until your 27th birthday. You do not have to document anything regarding your disability, or your student status.

2.  Once you turn 27, you will have to seek out your own coverage. Assuming that you have no income, you will need to apply for your State's version of Medicaid.  

3.  Regarding your medical records. What will be useful for your doctor to have an idea, your doctors will want to reconfirm everything that your medical records say. Essentially, they will be forced to duplicate all of the work that has already been done, mainly because no doctor in his right mind is going to take translated medical records at face value.

I hope this has been helpful, and if you need any clarification or follow-up, please just ask."
HealthInsurance,This is absolutely terrible advice. The penalty will be effective on your 2018 taxes.
HealthInsurance,You are correct. Any family disqualifies for CHIP would have no need to put their children on an employer-sponsored insurance plan.
HealthInsurance,"Hmmm. I filled out the exemption tool and it said I don't qualify for any in 2017...

Do you know if (since I haven't had insurance in 2018 yet) the fine works on a month to month basis? That is, should I immediately sign up for some cheap healthcare in order to minimize my loss?"
HealthInsurance,"Well the next step is to find a tool on IRS.gov site.  There is a calculator for the fee based on income, and how many months you had coverage.  Typically, if you didn’t have coverage for 2 months they won’t charge a fee. 

If you can’t find the calculator, I can reply with a link once I get home."
HealthInsurance,"Know that MassHealth pays 3 months of back medical bills - talk to them about it when you apply. So you could get care before it’s approved. 

You should also check with your parents HR department on what their requirements for disabled adult child coverage are — although since you’ve already aged out I don’t have high hopes. "
HealthInsurance,"Hi! I have crohns too! You probably will spend less in the long run if you buy a gold/platinum plan with higher premium (lower out of pocket max) than if you buy a cheap plan with high deductible, oop max. I buy up to the more expensive plan at my work, because I am always at the doctors, have expensive imaging tests often as well as a lot of prescriptions. 

When job searching, really look at the health insurance plans the company offers. Ask how much they contribute and what your monthly premium would be. Look at the SBC to see how visits and prescriptions will be covered. Employer plans are usually cheaper and richer than individual plans. Good luck! "
HealthInsurance,"There are exemptions, people. Go look it up on the IRS website. Exemptions you can claim on your taxes to avoid the penalty. Now stop trolling and go elsewhere "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;given that I can't see a US doctor without insurance? 

well.... you can see any MD you wish, with or without insurance - but the MD's bill would be yours to pay absent your enrollment in health insurance coverage"
HealthInsurance,"I am not affiliated with Aetna or cigna but we even limit what plans within our own company that deductible or out of pocket can be carried over or credited to. The only time I see credits that are out of the ordinary (not moving from one group to another under the same client) are when an employer is changing insurance carriers and negotiates it as part of their on boarding to our company.

You also mention an exchange. Being it sounds like you have individual coverage I would be extremely surprised to find that cigna will give you credit from another insurance company. 

That said you should contact your current insurance that you want to apply credit and inquire with them. Ultimately it would be them applying any credit.  I would suggest you are prepared with your explanations of benefits from your prior coverage. If they will give you credit they will likely want copies of these to see what was applied under your prior coverage. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for your reply. After a little digging, I am finding that it is unlikely I will get anything to transfer. The Aetna rep made it sound like it was covered under the ACA, though she did not state that explicitly.

I will certainly inquire with Cigna. I also found out today I will end up having to repay my premium tax credit because I declined my employer plan for Nov/Dec because I had also maxed out the Cigna plan. 
"
HealthInsurance,"I have a lot of experience with exchange plans and ACA regs, I’ve never heard of this. Not saying it isn’t possible but this is new to me. Maybe it’s a state reg but since your new plan is in CO it may not apply. 

Also congrats on being clean! Good for you continuing to get treatment and not giving up. "
HealthInsurance,"What is the EOB of your out of network plan say? That $900 is probably going towards the out of network deductible. Balance Billing is the provider charging you the difference from what they charged the insureance and what the insurance paid. It may or may not be legal in Idaho, but is a frowned upon practice."
HealthInsurance,"If I were you I would go for the high deductible low premium plan. The high premium, low deductible plans are best for people with chronic health problems who know they need lots of treatment, prescriptions, and doctors visits. For example, I've had a chronic skin condition basically my whole life, and have seen dermatologists since I was a kid. It's worth it for me to pay an extra $150/mo in premiums to get a $0 deductible. $150 * 12 is $1800, vs a $7500 deductible. If you're still shopping for plans you should be able to find a SCB like realanceps said, look at how much the services you're thinking of getting might be, and calculate an expected cost for the year.

It sounds like you and your wife won't need more than the annual wellness exam/a checkup (which, btw, would include a pap smear for your wife, so she wouldn't need to see a gyn). "
HealthInsurance,"It is listed as in-network charges but it says it is a PPO in the notes. The 30% coinsurance was applied to her in-network out-of-pocket maximum. Kaiser said that they only allowed about $500 for an anesthesiologist, which to me is absurd. We're being charged the $150ish for the 30% coinsurance on the Amount Allowed and then balance billed for the other $750ish. Both the anesthesiologists office and the insurance just said there was nothing they could do, but I feel like we could escalate it with some advice/knowledge from the community. :-|"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I am finding that it is unlikely I will get anything to transfer. 

yeah, that sounded like some kind of miscommunication out of the gate.

&gt;I will end up having to repay my premium tax credit

well, you don't ""repay"" it, but all else held equal, you may wind up with a higher 2017 tax bill than you anticipated."
HealthInsurance,"What if you live in Texas and have a state job and the state pays for your monthly healthcare premiums? "
HealthInsurance,"Its not frowned upon, its common practice for OON providers, ESPECIALLY anesthesiologists."
HealthInsurance,"You need to find out if its in network or out of network because you said both. If they are out of network then you can try to negotiate a lower amount with them, or appeal through your insurance. If its in network then they cant balance bill. "
HealthInsurance,"Co-insurance is a percentage after the insurance writes off a portion of the charged amount. 

**20% co-insurance** Charge: $400 ; Write-off: -$100 ; Co-insurance: 20% of $300 = $60 ; insurance will pay $240 and you will pay $60. 

So to answer your question, you can't pay a percentage of a bill without insurance writing-off a portion first, but depending on the facility's policies they might want you to pay it upfront. "
HealthInsurance,"No they have their own deductible out of pocket etc. 

They can be on your plan but will have a different card and a different account from you.

Your plan may now have a family deductible out of pocket instead of individual but each person has the individual deductible out of pocket cost. 

Babies cost money"
HealthInsurance,"To add to what already's been said; newborns are on their parent's insurance for 48 hours.  After that, they need to be insured with their own plan.  

Re: your insurance; do you receive subsidies?"
HealthInsurance,This is the best post this sub has ever seen.
HealthInsurance,"You absolutely should not pay them this money before it's sorted out. You need to call your insurer, and ask if this facility is in network. If it is not, you need to go somewhere else. If they are in network, but refuse to Bill your insurance, that is shady as f***, and you need to find another facility. Essentially, either way, you need to find another facility"
HealthInsurance,"COBRA is not an option.  You need to get your own plan.  Your best bet is to find a local independent insurance agent, aka broker, and sit down and draw up some potential cost/benefits for different types of insurance plans and figure out what works.  u/realanceps may have more specific recommendations"
HealthInsurance,wait why would cobra not be an option?
HealthInsurance,"you are correct.  The following are qualifying events for the spouse and dependent child of a covered employee if they cause the spouse or
dependent child to lose coverage:
• Termination of the covered employee’s employment for any reason other than “gross misconduct”;
• Reduction in the hours worked by the covered employee;
• Covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare;
• Divorce or legal separation of the spouse from the covered employee; or
• Death of the covered employee.
In addition to the above, the following is a qualifying event for a dependent child of a covered employee if it causes the
child to lose coverage:
• Loss of “dependent child” status under the plan rules. Under the Affordable Care Act, plans that offer coverage to
children on their parents’ plan must make the coverage available until the adult child reaches the age of 26.

You are incredibly unlikely to be unable to find more affordable similar coverage for yourself, though.  I am assuming your income is much lower than your parents and you will qualify for either a subsidized plan through the feds, or a plan through your workplace (if thats a thing)

https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/publications/an-employees-guide-to-health-benefits-under-cobra.pdf"
HealthInsurance,"Try putting your income in as $16,800 - You should qualify for a tax credit of $234 per month and cost sharing reductions on a silver plan - Premiums for bronze plans should start at $1.00 per month for you - Silver plans (With the cost sharing reductions) from about $45.  If you're still having problems you'll have to call Covered California at (800) 300-1506 - They're open 8AM to 8PM Monday through Friday and 8AM to 6PM Saturday and Sunday."
HealthInsurance,"ah i see. so i will be able to have cobra coverage. 

i see doctors regularly, and i checked today and the ppo plan was 860 a month! thats insane! 

its a PPO though none of the medicaid plans i see or rhe affordable care act plans are ppo "
HealthInsurance,"wow this is confusing. 

if my parents are switching jobs in a few months, before i turn 26, can i do cobra then? and then do i have to do cobra again when i turn 26 except then ill have to use their new insurance? "
HealthInsurance,"Your best bet is to see a broker.  Yes there are very few PPO options for individuals.   Do you routinely see specialists who aren't local?  "
HealthInsurance,What state do you live in and how much do you think you'll earn this year?
HealthInsurance,"yeah, this is just amateur hour. If your employer's aware of this s/he should put distance between company and this broker pronto."
HealthInsurance,You have two options - COBRA coverage through your previous employer - You pay the full premium plus a 2% administration fee - You can contact your HR for more info and costs.  You have 60 days from your last date of coverage to elect COBRA - So it is possible to not pay anything unless something catastrophic happens.  The other option is purchasing a policy on the marketplace - You losing coverage due to quitting your job would be a qualifying event.  You should qualify for a slight subsidy.
HealthInsurance,"I won’t be getting insurance through my next employer, so we will need to get our own insurance anyways. I’m not sure if we need to be Wyoming residents to qualify for a new policy within the Wyoming network. Any idea? If we do, we’ll likely have to do cobra for the period of unemployment. "
HealthInsurance,Washington State and maybe 50K for the year. If lucky.
HealthInsurance,Do you remember the name of the insurance company?
HealthInsurance,"File a grienace, maybe it will help, maybe it wont,  it's extremely hard to prove that idiot behavior is actually malicious on purpose, but if it keeps happening your insurance has the power to at least try to do something about it."
HealthInsurance,"Here's a pretty useful list that's less than a year old http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2017/jun/balance-billing-consumer-protections-states


Complaining to your elected officials is the only way this might get addressed.  It's purely a legal issue, under current laws about how business and contracts work."
HealthInsurance,Blue cross blue shield I think ��
HealthInsurance,"Accidental maliciousness on purpose "
HealthInsurance,"Could be incompetence, or could be balance billing. Balance billing is illegal in most states, so check your state laws. Then, request an EOB (explanation of benefits) statement for each visit from your insurance company. 

An example of balance billing: office bills insurance $200 for your visit. Per their payment agreement, insurance covers $100. Your copay is $20.  It’s (probably) illegal for them to charge you the $80 remaining balance.  They have to ‘write off’ the remaining balance. 

Look at your EOBs, and compare them to your payment receipts. If the amount the office charged you matches the amount insurance did not cover, then they are balance billing you. "
HealthInsurance,So you have a deductible but it doesnt apply to repeated visits to a specialist office? Not trying to be devils advocate here but are you sure your insurance rep had it right? That seems...odd
HealthInsurance,Legal terminology ftw
HealthInsurance,"Your daughter should qualify for the Apple Health program - You'll have to pay a small premium.

HealthInsurance,"&gt; saying that I owed $300 because they do not have my health insurance on file and I need to get them my old insurance card which I no longer have. 

Your timeline's a bit confusing. 

1) when did university coverage start - what month

2) is eye doc  billing you for service you received 6 months ago, or since your new coverage started? They should not need prior insurance for anything having to do with current treatment - treatment since your new university coverage started."
HealthInsurance,"2nding NNJ's recommendation - get your dates, names, facts on info you've accumulated to date in a row so you can run the conversation."
HealthInsurance,"No I have deductible that is for outpatient procedures, surgery, etc if I go to this particular dr because they are in network. Just ordinarily office visits have a co-pay of $20.
The clerk at the at the dr told me that I hadn’t reached my deductible so I had to pay out of pocket until it was reached. So for the 2 instances that have gone through so far I paid $150 each then when they submitted the claim my insurance paid them $130, since I was only supposed to be paying my copay. 
Even though I’ve spent close to $600 none of that went towards my deductible because my insurance said I was only responsible for just my $20 copay. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  I’m not sure if we need to be Wyoming residents to qualify for a new policy within the Wyoming network. Any idea? 

My idea is you probably need to report a Wyoming address when enrolling. You WILL be living there, yes? Since Wyoming doesn't run its own exchange, contact Healthcare.gov to confirm what they need for you to successfully enroll for coverage as a soon-to-be-new Wyoming resident. If you prefer to DIY before contacting gov't.gov, try a site like [HealthSherpa](https://www.healthsherpa.com) to do a bit of shopping in the zip code where you anticipate living

EDIT: s'ok, basically it looks like you can pick a plan &amp; deal with confirmation of your address later. [Here's Healthcare.gov's FAQ page on confirming a move &amp; your new address](https://www.healthcare.gov/help/prove-move/). I'd still confirm with a CSR at healthcare.gov



&gt;If we do, we’ll likely have to do cobra for the period of unemployment.

here's [a summary of a COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) which may help with your coverage timeline &amp; budget. Proceed carefully, given that you have 3 kids - they do the darnedest things, dontcha know, some of which can result in an unexpected need for medical attention.


"
HealthInsurance,"The EOB shows $150 billed, then $20 copay , then paid by coverage and it’s the remaining. 

Underneath that it shows member pays $20.
I paid the $150. "
HealthInsurance,"The special enrollment period starts only after you move - Although you might be able to get an SEP because you're going to lose coverage.  You can try calling healtucare.gov and they might have more information for you.  It also appears you might actually be entitled to a substantial tax credit due to a quirk in the pricing of the plans in Wyoming.  "
HealthInsurance,"You need to take that to the billing department and get a $130 refund, then.  That’s nuts. "
HealthInsurance,"I did and they have said they will refund me. I just wonder how many other people they are doing it to. "
HealthInsurance,"Probably a lot. I had a doctors office that tried to charge us the emergency copay whenever we made a sick appointment.  The insurance was billed the same, but they were getting an extra $10-30 per visit, depending on copays. "
HealthInsurance,"That’s insane. "
HealthInsurance,"unless you anticipate needing significant dental work during the next 12-24 months, dental insurance rarely provides subtantial economic value. 

Why?

Low annual and lifetime maximum benefits payable, plus, generally, long wait times once enrolled for eligibility for benefit payments on the more costly forms of dental care. You MAY find you obtain decent ""discounts"" (30-ish percent) on your total cost of coverage (premiums you pay plus your share of any treatment costs) vs your ""raw"" treatment charges, but it doesn't always happen, and you may be able to negotiate net prices as favorable on your own (for a variety of reasons good dentists tend to be better businesspeople than  good doctors)."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. That is what she was on. I guess we need to figure out why her coverage was stopped.

How does it work now that the open enrollment time is over? Is it different for children?

Thanks!"
HealthInsurance,"Okay.  There, do you feel like a big boy now?

Good.  We’re done here, we just disagree.

Have a nice day."
HealthInsurance,"i searched of the covered california site and that was the prices they showed me. where on the site did you see $80/month? 

to clarify, 24k/year is my income after taxes, are you supposed to put your after-tax income instead?"
HealthInsurance,"Ok. Thanks for the feedback. "
HealthInsurance,"This is great info. Thank you. "
HealthInsurance,"I think we were using the same site, but it was this: https://apply.coveredca.com/apspahbx/ahbxanonym.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_st=&amp;_nfls=false&amp;_pageLabel=previewPlanPage# 

You are supposed to put your before tax income. Ballparking here but if you make $34k/year ish before taxes, I think that's too much to qualify for medical.  Interestingly enough, I was messing around with the shop and compare and a higher income (for example $60k/year) has the cheapest plan at $160/mo, but $34k/year has the cheapest plan at $172/mo. It told me, for the higher income, that I may qualify for ""negotiated marketplace prices,"" and for the lower income that there may be ""monthly premium tax credits"" (which was only $8/mo).

Anyways, I just signed up through coveredca myself yesterday, so if you have any questions feel free to ask. Also, if you are a healthy adult and you don't think you'd use the insurance very much, it would be cheaper just pay the fine. For 2018 it's $695 or 2.5% of income, whichever is higher. "
HealthInsurance,"This is probably more geared towards /r/legaladvice. 

Most likely you would have to pay the bill and seek reimbursement from bio dad once hes released from prison but i am not a lawyer. "
HealthInsurance,"Nope, still looking for a new job. I'm in Missouri. I put $0 income down on the form and after digging around a bit more I found out why they're not giving me a premium tax credit... 

""Your yearly household income ($0.00) is too low for advance payments of the premium tax credit. Generally, households whose income for the year is between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level for their family size may be eligible.""

So I guess I'm SOL until I have a reported income.  I feel like I'd get in trouble if I put in an estimated income for my future job just to receive a credit.

"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;...called them to find out how much it will cost. She told me it will be $425 something, although she mentioned there will probably be some sort of discount included when insurance doesn't cover it but I don't know how much.

Hmmm.

[This page from Planned Parenthood's site suggests your removal cost should be ""between $0 and $300""] (https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-implanon/how-can-i-get-the-birth-control-implant). Maybe get a ""second opinion"", or bargain harder?  Or contact Planned Parenthood &amp; find out where they suggest you have the gadget removed?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;It seems weird 

hospital billing is often weird - like most health services billing. can you post a de-identified bill and/or Explanation of Benefits (EOB)? It may be easier for experts here to detect if something's not ""normal"" that way"
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, that’s what I suspected. In most states you would qualify for Medicaid, but Missouri has chosen not to do that. Sorry :(

(I will say that you won’t get in trouble for putting an optimistic projection of income — but based on whether it’s super different from your income for prior years sometimes it gets selected for verification. If you don’t verify it adequately they pull your tax credits going forward.)"
HealthInsurance,"Neither job provides employer sponsored insurance? Have you considered a catastrophic plan? "
HealthInsurance,"Technically a Medicaid denial (which is what that sounds like) should qualify you for a special enrollment period. But if your income is low enough for Medicaid, it's worth a shot to appeal."
HealthInsurance,"Healthcare.gov has a good explanation of what qualifying life events entail. https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/

As for the coverage, I believe employers only have to cover 50% of the cost based on the cheapest plan they offer. It varies from state to state, but that's what I've read. If he's meeting that then you're out of luck unfortunately.

Insurance has gotten crazy expensive the last two years, in my own scenario my insurance went up more than my raise, so I'm making less than I did two years ago after everything is said and done. I can't totally blame your boss for cutting back. Might be time to look for a new job, but it'll be hard to find one that offered that sweet of a deal. "
HealthInsurance,"Does it make a difference that the plan is completely in my name? In other words, it is not an employer sponsored plan, they only pay the invoice every month. BCBS's website clearly says that the open enrollment period lasts until January 31st, could that be a mistake? Or am I misunderstanding what they mean by open enrollment period. "
HealthInsurance,"Car insurance has personal injury protection. You would not use your health insurance following an accident anyway. So you would not be ""boned"" by a car accident."
HealthInsurance,"This is a possibility. Because what happens a lot is that the doctor will go from using “routine visit” code to a “chest discomfort” code. Which immediately makes it a doctor visit and subject to benefits/copay. 

So if you want to keep this visit free, I would refrain from mentioning any issues. You said your copay is(probably) $25, but I would double check and make sure your pcp visits are not subject to deductible first, otherwise you’ll have $25, and then dedu amount. "
HealthInsurance,"I think it probably depends on the type of insurance and whether you get subsidies. Additionally, if you were automatically re-enrolled that could cause complications. Usually if the first person I talk to doesn't give me an answer that sounds right, I call back until I get someone to help out. "
HealthInsurance,"Absolutely correct. Deviating from the below list changes things from a preventative visit to a routine office visit subject to deductible and copay/coinsurance.

https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/"
HealthInsurance,That’s all I should ask for now?
HealthInsurance,"This is correct.  A preventive exam is when you are not having any medical issues, and the visit is to confirm this.  If you discuss any health issues you have or may be having, the doctor can bill for a office visit for illness or injury.

Depending on the billing, part of the claim can be billed and paid as preventive, with the diagnostic portion of the claim being covered under those benefits.  

This applies to blood work as well.  Not all blood work done as part of a physical are covered as preventive.  Only certain services can be paid as preventive, and some of those only under certain circumstances, such as age, gender, etc.

If you are not having any health issues, just tell the doctor this if they ask you if you have anything you wanna talk about or whatever.  You may also want to contact your insurance company to see if they have a list of preventive care services.  I have had people print this list out and give it to their doctors saying ""if it is not on this list, or I do not qualify for it, don't do it."""
HealthInsurance,"That’s it... the benefit summary should give you all your plan options, what you’ll have to pay when you visit and doctor, and the amount that will be deducted from your paycheck. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Ihave a co worker that uses them and all he had to do was submit the receipts and they cleared it.

&gt;I'm not sure what else to do here.

Did you submit your receipts?

"
HealthInsurance,Yep
HealthInsurance,"Find an independent insurance agent, aka broker, and sit down with them to discuss your options.  If you happen to have anything in writing, like your benefits packet from your job, and your certificate of enrollment with your current insurance, bring it.  Also bring a recent pay stub, your income matters."
HealthInsurance,"Unfortunately this kind of issue is everywhere.  As daneslord mentioned, the feds add another layer of complexity,  and they are slower than ever this year.   If you get sick or need a Dr appt for something, there are work arounds while you wait, but it sounds like that's unlikely.  "
HealthInsurance,"Your employer could change plans by next year, and you could change employers too.  Like daneslord said, get some basic info so you know what you're  looking at in case you decide to shop around or look at other employers.  Maybe shake hands with the guy from the insurance brokerage.  When it gets closer to the time, talk to HR about any documents you need."
HealthInsurance,"Community health / family health clinics are generally cheapest.  They are sometimes affiliated with public hospitals.  They sometimes even have their own ""care plan"", where you join/pay a memerbship fee, and then office visists are cheaper, certain meds are cheaper.  Also many have income sensitive sliding scale prices, if you'll be paying cash.  Some urgent care centers have a similar set up, if there are any stand alone urgent care centers in your area."
HealthInsurance,What are you looking to get out of your ideal plan?
HealthInsurance,"Oh she is a brutish citizen. "
HealthInsurance,"Sometimes in CA the company/broker can submit an exception request to change plans. It is up to the carrier to approve or deny. Otherwise your only chance is having a qualifying life event (getting married, having a baby etc)"
HealthInsurance,"I think it will cost them extra to do drug testing. I have seen companies offer this type of blood work and I think they usually stick to the markers they say they are testing for. "
HealthInsurance,"Maybe contact British embassy to find out what they can tell you about NHS coverage for care ""events"" that happen when citizens are out of the country. Typically embassy staff are not thoroughly knowledgeable themselves but can direct you to explanatory resources.

Also kudos to your grandma for making the trip!"
HealthInsurance,Lol thanks! I asked the NHS and apparently there is no agreement. Her private health insurance will cover emergencies for 90 days but that’s about it.
HealthInsurance,"Are you planning on going to the doctors regularly? If they don't let you change plan, you can enroll in a HSA and at least save on taxes for those medical expenses."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;will cover emergencies for 90 days

so ""only for the first 90 days of her trip""? Or only for the first 90 days from the 1st date of treatment, in the event she needs it? 

Seems...odd...that there would be a 3 month cutoff. Seems like if there are extenuating circumstances there would be a way to obtain an ""extension"" of sorts, since this situation is clearly an outlier. Maybe contact gram's MP to see if they have any way of getting some kind of special treatment?

&amp; what if anything does Canada's system do for someone who winds up spending 3+ months in Canada? I imagine you've inquired, but just wondering if there's anything specific to point to."
HealthInsurance,So you haven't had health coverage for about 8 months. What prompts your sudden interest in obtaining coverage now?
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I am now realizing that was VERRRRY stupid

Run yourself a total cost of coverage comparison of the options you had. [Here's what it a comparison looks like.](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif) 

You may find that the difference among plans is smaller than you imagine."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; If they don't let you change plan, you can enroll in a HSA 

OP said they are in a plan with a high deductible. They did NOT say they are in a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). There's a meaningful difference, as only the latter would qualify them to establish/fund an HSA - and mere presence of a high deductible doesn't make a plan a HDHP.
"
HealthInsurance,Are the receipts detailed and do they show exactly what services you had done?
HealthInsurance,"I would have preferred to have insurance the whole time, but after leaving school/immediately after starting a new job I couldn't afford it. I was hoping to get coverage during open enrollment, but I mistakenly thought the deadline was the end of the year, so I missed it. Also, before starting the new job, I qualified for an income based assistance type program through an area health care company/hospital, but my new job puts my earnings just barely above the income cutoff for that program."
HealthInsurance,Yup. It'll tell you everything about your plan. Maybe ask how to find the provider directory as well.
HealthInsurance,"Yes they all show chiropractic adjustments. They gave the exact receipts to my coworker and they told me that is what they give everyone for their FSA. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; BCBS's website clearly says that the open enrollment period lasts until January 31st, could that be a mistake?

can you post a de-identified screencap showing us what you're seeing? Because 1/31 is NOT a standard open enrollment window end date"
HealthInsurance,"TLDR for everyone:

Insurance website listed BH provider as in network. OP made appt and received services. Claim was denied as out of network and insurance company (apparently) admitted online directory was out of date. 

OP ignored letters/bills and bill was paid by garnishing state refund tax.


EDIT: actually its not clear if the provider ever submitted a claim to insurance. OP can you clarify?"
HealthInsurance,"Does the receipt have CPT and diagnosis codes? You might have to submit a medical claim before they'll process your FSA claim. "
HealthInsurance,"I work at a restaurant and she's a retail salesperson. No insurance offered to either of us.

I don't know what a catastrophic plan is but ill look into it"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for the TLDR!

Yes, the provider did submit the claim to insurance. "
HealthInsurance,https://www.healthcare.gov/choose-a-plan/plans-categories/#catastrophic
HealthInsurance,Out of network ER visits are covered at the same rate as in network.  What the letter is referring to is the fact that that hospital will no longer be covered for non emergency procedures
HealthInsurance,You have just made my day sir and or madam.  Thank you for your assistance.
HealthInsurance,"Not a problem. That's what we're here for. "

HealthInsurance,"This looks to me like either some kind of supplemental plan that sweetens another existing one or more like a bare bones “just in case” non-ACA plan. The hyperlink at the top of the SBC takes us to a page that says:

&gt; _These are limited coverage plans and do not provide coverage for hospitalization. Depending on your employer elected plan, services such as preventive care, prescription drug coverage and limited physician visits are available._

Your employer would have to explain why this plan covers so little. They do have their purposes, but as a stand-alone plan this one is pretty empty. It’s more or less just Dr visits, urgent cares, and low-level prescriptions."
HealthInsurance,"3000 for a root canal is freaking ridiculous. Most insurance pays dentist 500 to 700 bucks for an anterior tooth and 1000 to 1200 for a molar and that’s being generous. For 3000 you should be getting a root canal, build up, and crown. Shoot for that price you can get an extraction, implant and crown.

If the tooth isn’t bothering you I would brush, floss and rinse until you build up the funds or get a second opinion. Do not have any good debris in your mouth when you go to sleep. Most places can probably do a pulpotomy (take out the nerve) to rid your pain if the tooth isn’t necrotic and buys you some time

-oral surgeon"
HealthInsurance,"I'm sorry, I didn't specify. It breaks down like this:

D3330 Endodontic therapy - molar - $1780

D2392 Resin composite-2s, posterior - $273

D2740 Crown-porcelain/ceramic substr - $1683

D2954 Prefab post/core in add to cm - $461

Total is $4197.


The tooth is mildly bothering me. My dentist offered to do the pulpotomy for about $500 but urged me that I would need to be back within a week to get the full procedure finished once we did that. 

In your professional opinion, is there anyway to hold out until 4/01/18 from now? Is there serious risk of further infection or the tooth just falling out if I was to even try that?"
HealthInsurance,"I would need to see an X-ray and clinical picture of the tooth "
HealthInsurance,"First representative was kinda right and wrong at same time.


Call marketplace back and have them go back over your eligibility results and start date.  If you went thro the application already but haven’t picked a plan, all that information will be listed for them.
You are eligible for a special enrollment period as your losing coverage.  

Your start date will vary on when you called, and when your actual coverage stops.

So your coverage ends on 3-3-18.  Technically I would have listed your end date as the last day of February. 2-28-18 on the application.  (Coverage would overlap but no gaps. ). That “ should” get a start date of 3-1-18.  I say should. It’s not guaranteed.
If that happens then you pick a plan and pay for it before the start date.


So where you stand now, you have a 4-1 start date.  Guessing it’s because you listed the 3-3 being you last day of coverage.  The application would kick that over to the next month.   Hence the 4-1 start date. 

Now on your eligibility results, you probably are going to have to mail in a copy of your coverage ending to prove you are actually eligible for the special enrollment period that was granted.  If so get a copy mailed in to marketplace as soon as possible. 

As for you application, you do not want to keep going thro it multiple times, you can lose the SEP(special enrollment period) by going back through the application time and Time again trying to get an earlier start date. 


So let’s say you are stuck with the 4-1 start date that leaves you with a gap of no insurance.  Worst case right? 

You could be eligible for Cobra, for a month, if your other coverage was work provided.  Bit expensive but something covering is better then nothing. 
You might be able to get short term coverage for a month.  Not 100% sure if insurance companies would be willing to cover you for just a month, but I’m not an insurance agent.

"
HealthInsurance,"Root canal is a bacteria factory because the immune system can’t reach inside it. Better to extract and get a full tooth implant. "
HealthInsurance,"Large group and self-funded plans don't have to cover Essential Health Benefits - These plans meet the minimum essential coverage test and allow the employer to avoid paying the fine in some situations.  Depending on whether or not the employer offers a more comprehensive plan the OP may have be able to qualify for a tax credit.

https://www.onedigital.com/blog/skinny-minimum-essential-coverage-plans-right/
"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for your thoughtful reply. Unfortunately I already picked the plan and yes, I listed the 3/3/18 end date. I should be able to get letter from current employer fairly easily which I believe is my last step if start date does not change. I will call again and see if someone can offer me more help regarding start date.

I will email my current company regarding cobra eligibility. I briefly looked at temporary insurance websites but they left me skeptical. I just need something in case something catastrophic happens. Maybe temporary insurance can offer me that, I’ll investigate further. Thanks again."
HealthInsurance,"Even if you picked a plan, you still should have a window of time to change it or etc.  the sep usually is for a few days to months depending on application.
When you call, some representatives are helpful, others , just read the screen. 

Hopefully you can find something that works for you!  

Worst case, sounds like cobra would cover you for that month and then you would go into your marketplace coverage.  "
HealthInsurance,"OP was offered this plan - is it likely a large employer is offering it? "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I just need something in case something catastrophic happens. Maybe temporary insurance can offer me that, I’ll investigate further. 

if you *are* eligible for COBRA (state-level rules vary for firms under 20 employees), you may be interested in this [COBRA bridge strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) that outlines how to keep your coverage options open without parting with any $ until/unless you need the continuation coverage for any reason."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks again. Yes, the first guy was going to look into it but the second just said “no, can’t” so I figured I’d look into it on my own before calling again."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;i have heard of free clinics 

you mostly need to locate one near you. [Check here](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/)."
HealthInsurance,"Interesting. Is the only requirement that I’m eligible for Cobra in the first place? I honestly have next to no idea how cobra works, I’ll look into it. I am voluntary leaving company (healthcare staffing company out of Wisconsin, working 5 month contract in Montana currently) and going to work PRN with healthcare company in my home stare at high hourly rate but with no benefits.

Edit: grammar"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,He posted that he was 24 about 6 months ago - So 24/25?
HealthInsurance,"I'm just assuming - I could be wrong.  "
HealthInsurance,"that makes two of us ;-) 

happily we can ""blame"" it on OP for not telling us how big their employer is"
HealthInsurance,"Thank you i did try to call a UMC and they said i needed a w-2 form, but the IRS but it says it cant verify me for some reason. Do you think the social security office can help me?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Is the only requirement that I’m eligible for Cobra in the first place? 

well, if you're not eligible for COBRA, the bridge strategy isn't an option for you, so.....

but if you ARE, that means you have a 60 day period from the date you receive your COBRA continuation notice to *elect* the coverage, retroactive to the last day of your *prior* coverage. So, the option gives you the ability to hold off plunking down the premium for the coverage until and unless you *really* need it. Note that if you face a routine MD visit, you don't *really* need to have insurance - the cost of the visit will possibly be less than the cost of your COBRA premium PLUS whatever your share of the visit cost is (assuming you aren't a regular doctor-goer). In that case you'd decide if you needed to pull the trigger on your COBRA coverage based on the size of the doctor's proposed charge."
HealthInsurance,Okay it sounds like the way to go. Do I just check with employer to see if I am eligible? Thanks!
HealthInsurance,"I'm no expert but I imagine you'll need help from someone who can verify your income or earnings. Social services maybe? If a clinic staffer asked you, they should be able to suggest resources you can consult for that info."
HealthInsurance,"to confirm your eligibility, yes.  If your employer has 20 or more employees, or you're in a large state, you probably are eligible for continuation coverage, and if you ARE eligible, your employer or whomever they've hired to administer their benefits is obliged to notify you, formally of your continuation option. That notice - especially the date you receive it - is important, because that's the date your 60-day election window starts. Based on what you've said, you only need 30 of it, which is always good ;-)  Good luck"
HealthInsurance,Ok thank you for your help i appreciate it.
HealthInsurance,I don't think the insurance provider cares where the money comes from as long as they get paid.
HealthInsurance,Damn. I was hoping that it was some weird Supplement Plan the company gave to its Medicare employees
HealthInsurance,"Still doesn't matter. Unless OP is in Montana, they can fire him for any reason that isn't retaliation or illegal discrimination."
HealthInsurance,"If you search the name of the company that the documents prepared for, it is a sub-unit of Xerox."
HealthInsurance,Or an urgent care
HealthInsurance,"Hiya, so it sounds like your company's insurance is ""unaffordable"" under the ACA.  (can be no more than 9.56% of total wages).  Assuming that $750/month is more than 9.56% of your total wages (you'd have to be making about 94K for this not to be the case), this means that you can go through the marketplace *and* get subsidies from the exchange as though your employer did not offer insurance at all.

Re: your company offering insurance.  They really shouldn't be offering it at all; it makes no business sense for a company that small to not send their employees to the exchange.  "
HealthInsurance,"They can absolutely pay for it (rx payments are at point of sale), and they can pay for that.  The only problem I can see is that they might be upset if you CCR them."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for replying! 

Cool, but here's the second problem - open enrollment is over, correct? How do I get health insurance now? 

My employer I guess is under the assumption he has to offer insurance? This shit confuses he and I more than I can tell you. "
HealthInsurance,"When is your employer's open enrollment?

Also, no, he doesn't need to offer insurance until he fits 50 employees (no covered lives, 50 employees)."
HealthInsurance,"We're about to finalize the plan for this year, so right now. If I'm better off bailing out of this and getting the marketplace, I can do that, but I can no longer get marketplace coverage until October, right? "
HealthInsurance,"no correct.  When enrollment for you current plan starts, file an application through the marketplace, and for the love of god, do not submit for insurance through your employer.  "
HealthInsurance,"Disagree with employer being too small to offer insurance. No way to appropriately compare situations without knowing specifics rates, benefits. Not the matter at hand.

First, yes you should’ve been offered the opportunity to enroll when you turned 26, I.e. “aged-off” your parents’ plan. This is what’s called a qualifying event.

Second, if you’ve already missed marketplace enrollment, you don’t have a qualifying event to get consideration again. Sounds like your employer really botched this. Unfortunately, the recent mandate repeal doesn’t take effect until 2019, so you’re still on the hook for a penalty this year.

1. When is your company’s annual enrollment? This differs from employer to employer and may not necessarily be January 1. 

2. What insurance carrier is your company with and where are you located? I’m interested to know when the last time your broker assessed options for your company. PM if you’d like some further direction.

Disclosure: I work for a major insurance carrier."
HealthInsurance,"ACA website I'd think would be your best bet, or you can google things like ""Private health insurance"" and contact a brokerage."
HealthInsurance,"I wanted to make sure you saw this, it's a cross-post from my reply to the r/legaladvice post, which I hope is kosher.


1) Self-funded plans offered by employers are considered acceptable coverage by ACA per the IRS rule even when they don't cover much of anything. 

2) This covers preventative care only (immunization, physicals, certain meds). 

3) It won't help pay for anything if you get sick or hurt badly. 

4) It may give you access to a network where you can pay less if you do get sick/hurt, but I can't tell from the info available. 

If you have another employer-sponsored plan, it's probably a better option, unless you're willing to roll the dice on not getting sick or hurt, but want to make sure you can get cholesterol tests and the flu shot."
HealthInsurance,If OP has not had coverage since September I do not see how they would be able to enroll through the marketplace. The high cost of coverage itself is not a special enrollment period because OP was not on the coverage previously.
HealthInsurance,"Hi, yes im 24, sorry ive been gone an dhaven't checked reddit."
HealthInsurance,"So would you say with this plan since it says it says I can go to the doctors 5 times a year, does that mean I can go for a check up and get most things checked,  I actually havent had insurance in a couple years as this is the first job that offered it this plan is just 15 a month and the next one is 60 but it has a 10k deductible which I thought was way to much for what it was."
HealthInsurance,"I would not stay with this plan - It doesn't cover much - If you ended up in the hospital it wouldn't cover anything.  Can you post the Summary of Benefits and Coverage for the other plan(s) and we'll take a look.  Also, are you just covering yourself or are you insuring your wife as well?"

HealthInsurance,"Since you're losing coverage you qualify for a special enrollment period a Special Enrollment Period.  You can apply and view plans on healthcare.gov.  just as an FYI if you enter your income as zero you won't qualify for a subsidy - To qualify you're income has to be at least 100% of the federal poverty limit.  So if you do plan to get a job this year you should factor that in. "
HealthInsurance,"Also, what county in Florida do you live in?"
HealthInsurance,These are actually pretty good plans - Did you just want to go for a checkup to make sure everything is OK or do you suspect you'll be seeking more extensive treatment?
HealthInsurance,"Well sure, if I had the ambition to do *that*, I'd know ;-)

And Xerox used to (still does?) own Buck Consultants, so you'd think they'd know their way around regulatory requirements. Maybe they do; still smells fishy to me"
HealthInsurance,"Well I'm 24 and turn 25 in june, I have fairly decent diet workout 6 days a week, I haven't had a routine check up in a couple years though. Nor had health insurance in that amount of time."
HealthInsurance,What confuses me is the deductible on those plans. So if I go to the doctor I pay the full price of the appointment until I have payed the deductible?
HealthInsurance,If you're going only for a checkup (Not to treat a specific problem like an illness) then you won't pay anything.  It looks like the top tier plan covers some additional services before the deductible.
HealthInsurance,It's still better to have the full coverage - It's very easy to run up huge debts if you go without insurance.
HealthInsurance,ahh is that what the preventative meant for check ups?
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Sounds like your employer really botched this.

This much is definite. My hunch is broker isn't so hot either"

not CIGNA? I thought I saw CIGNA as alegiance's parent"
HealthInsurance,"Did you get an itemized bill? Because the fees are based on the specific services provided, any labs you got, any procedures you received and the provider also has a fee they charge which can change depending on the provider. What kind of plan do you have? You need to find out exactly what plan you have and what exactly is covered. Don't go to another provider because you will just be charged again unless you want a second opinion on the specific services provided. Did you not agree with what the provider did? "
HealthInsurance,You are correct.  I blame an exhausting day.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Would it be possible for me to keep my existing plan through July under Cobra?

Yep - provided your employer's plan is obliged to offer COBRA continuation, which it sounds like you're pretty sure is the case.

&gt;Lots of moving parts with this idea? 

Not really - but you may want to do a bit of cost benefit math on this thing. COBRA's typically pretty expensive since you're on the hook for 100+ % of the premium cost of the coverage you're continuing - that'll be a bunch more than whatever contributions your employer charges you for the coverage as an active employee.  What's your potential timing on leaving your current employer? Are you SURE your new employer's coverage options are not competitive? "
HealthInsurance,"Insurance plans can all me different.

Sit down with the benefits representative where you work and ask for help understanding things about your policy."
HealthInsurance,"All very good points. I don't know the exact details on the new employer's coverage, but I hope to soon"
HealthInsurance,"I'll need to look again. I got a bill. The second one hasn't come yet. But on the first bill, it's hard to see what is being covered. If I remember right there were two fees and if i subtract that from my portion the difference must be what insurance is paying. Yes. I got labs too. "
HealthInsurance,Can I ask which insurance carrier you have? Is it small group or individual? I think most in group have a 30 mile rule.
HealthInsurance,"Blue Shield of California, through my employer (large company). The options they've given me are within 30 miles, but still inaccessible in my circumstances (no car)."
HealthInsurance,Are you on an HMO? You should be able to have some sort of cost sharing with the insurance if you have a PPO...even if the provider you want to go to is out of network.
HealthInsurance,Because they are a high risk population?
HealthInsurance,just because it's an added expense.
HealthInsurance,"I think $700 for 10 weeks? It's a good plan but ridiculously expensive. "
HealthInsurance,The last day to get insurance from the state exchange.
HealthInsurance,Thanks. I didn't apply for medicaid assuming I made way too much since I didn't get into my state plan.
HealthInsurance,"Never assume!!  :)

Worst case they deny you and that gives you more of a direction to go in.

Same with Healthcare.gov. A lot of people won’t qualify outside open enrollment. But there’s lots of life event and situations that can make one eligible.

Most require some form of documentation, but it’s still free to apply, online or by calling them."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  If you’re healthy, you should be able to buy those catastrophic plans without being penalized. The premiums are cheaper

You ""work in healthcare"" but you're apparently not aware how little preventive checkups  cost, just how minuscule the share of premium they represent. 

And if you work in health *insurance*, you know  - you *should* know - that insurance professionals don't assert that ""insurance is a gamble"". And there is a rationale for that. 


What you're demonstrating is that you are not qualified to comment on this topic. 

"
HealthInsurance,"danes, bringing the **hot** sauce in here"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Since that's money that came from the FSA, do I need to get it back to that account?

No. Why? Because that ""account"" is a bookkeeping entry. There's no money in there. When you elect FSA participation, you're effectively instructing your employer **not to pay you that amount of money**. That's essentially why you get a sweet tax break on the amount of those funds. 


It's not ""your"" money unless &amp; until you present a qualifying claim for a payout, which is basically money your employer transmits *through* the FSA claims processing mechanism.


There's basically no place for those funds to be put back **into**."
HealthInsurance,"All health coverage is ""local"" - your options &amp; their costs to you, depend a lot on your specific circumstances of geographic location, your anticipated income, your health treatment needs, etc.

To give you actionable info, we'd need your city &amp; state or a zip, &amp; some idea of your 2018 income. That would enable a rough pricing exercise &amp; pointers on how to check for coverage terms for your meds."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I was denied for not meeting qualifications (income) for my state's healthcare plan

Indiana cut a special deal for its Medicaid expansion arrangement. Are you *sure* you were ""denied""? Can you post de-identified communications from Indiana marketplace administrators that confirms it?"

HealthInsurance,So I cannot get this insurance?
HealthInsurance,This does vary from state to state.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;given that we haven't ever had insurance we want to go to the doctor for things a physical, blood work to check vitamin and mineral levels, GYN, etc.

If her employer is offering ACA-compliant plans, you'll have preventive checkups covered in full BEFORE any deductibles apply.


re: deductibles: you may not need to meet a $6k FAMILY deductible before benefits are payable. One or both of your plans may have ""embedded"" individual deductibles, under which benefits are payable for a covered individual's treatment charges after a lower deductible is reached. 


Check your plans' Summaries  of Benefits and Coverage (SBCs) for info on these basic plan features. [SBCs look like this](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf), and wife's employer (or its insurers) are obliged to provide them to her/you."
HealthInsurance,"ok thank you, they are working on the PA now. Both meds work just one better than the other I guess, trade-offs."
HealthInsurance,"I don't want to say you can't without knowing all your circumstances, but don't be surprised if you try to sign up and can't. Open enrollment for ACA plans for 2018 is over."
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Hiya,

yes, that is extremely unusual.  Part of being ""in-network"" means that they agree to file the claims for you.  The other part that worries me, as that she's going to charge you a dollar amount.  But her contract with the insurer will say that she can only accept a lesser amount; so she will want to stick you with the difference.  

This is *highly* sketchy.  I'd call the insurer and open a grievance/appeal.  "
HealthInsurance,"Are you looking to still be on medicade or are you looking for private health insurance? I'd check with your school, they usually offer a default health insurance that is only good enough to not bankrupt you in emergencies."
HealthInsurance,"this, file a grievance"
HealthInsurance,"That's strange because as daneslord mentioned, being in network usually means they are obligated to file with your insurance.  I would call your insurance and ask about their timely filing limits.  For some insurances, if the in-network provider does not file by a certain time the member is not held accountable for the charges, so I would call your carrier and ask if there are timely filing limits for in-network providers."
HealthInsurance,Really? Don't you normally have a couple of days with any bill you pay? Is the ACA really that dystopian?
HealthInsurance,"Apparently for every payment aside from your first, you do. I'm being told now that I'm 100% out of luck. 

Granted, my policy was absolute garbage to begin with."
HealthInsurance,"Sorry to hear that. Jesus that's so fucking dystopian. I really hate the ACA and our entire pay to play system. it's hugely criminal. "
HealthInsurance,So the alternative would be signing up directly from an insurance provider like blue Cross correct?
HealthInsurance,"BTW, call your senator's office and congressperson and lodge a complaint with them, or at least let them know what's going on. Not that they'll give a shit, but you should do it. "
HealthInsurance,There's options out there. If you're a student check with your school about getting health insurance through them. Then there's tons of options when it comes to buying from a private health insurance marketplace - it just might cost more.
HealthInsurance,"Would you happen to have any suggestions? I'm working for a small business. I made the mistake of typing in my phone number on one private website and got about 20 phone calls in the next five minutes, lol."
HealthInsurance,"If you did, you'd still have to pay the penalty, because it wouldn't be an ACA compliant plan."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; so just to be sure I'm reading correctly in the example with the $500 contracted rate, you mean that the secondary could apply that to their deductible as well so the patient payment of $500 could satisfy both deductibles?

Exactly.

&gt; Since you asked, this particular patient has BCBS as primary and UMR as secondary and both have a $1000 deductible with 80% coinsurance. I always assumed that for patient responsibility you'd add up the two deductibles plus the 20% left over from the primary then 20% of that amount for the secondary coinsurance (like what you said for the crappier method) so it's nice to know that's not always the case!

Always happy to make the situation more complex ;)"
HealthInsurance,"I'd just google around, you'll see the same names popping up over and over - kaiser, ehealth (where you can also buy kaiser), anthem, aetna, etc, you could also call a health insurance broker locally and let them shop for you. Does your small business employer not offer any plans? Or is that the one you screwed up on?"
HealthInsurance,Completely agree with this. You never know what life will throw at you. The monthly premiums pale in comparison to how much you’ll pay out of pocket for a serious illness or injury.
HealthInsurance,"I've been in the employee benefits business for several decades. Like you, I've never seen an SPD detail what the dates or lengths of a plan's enrollment periods are. 

But I wasn't talking about that. 

I was talking about a) whether OP's employer has produced &amp; distributed an SPD, and b) if so whether that SPD talked at all about what constitutes an eligible employee, defined a ""participant"", etc. Which of course it should.

Forgive me if I'm getting an incorrect impression, but my impression is that you may be the sort of benefits ""professional"" who imagines your principal responsibility is ""guarding"" benefit plans from people who are otherwise eligible to participate in them, but who have been thwarted by ""clever"" process maneuvers inflicted on them by lazy, indifferent and/or devious administrative functionaries."
HealthInsurance,"In addition to what's been said here, you're looking at this the wrong way.  The point of insurance isn't to pay for everything,  it's you protect you against a disaster. 

122 is a small price to pay for the ability to have an illness not ruin you."

HealthInsurance,"&gt; SPDs don’t need to be distributed to employees, only made available upon request

{sigh}

From EBSA's [Health Plans &amp; Benefits: Plan Information](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/health-plans/planinformation) page:

&gt;The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) requires plan administrators - the people who run plans - to give plan participants in writing the most important facts they need to know about their retirement and health benefit plans including plan rules, financial information, and documents on the operation and management of the plan. Some of these facts must be provided to participants regularly and automatically by the plan administrator. Others are available upon request, free-of-charge or for copying fees. The request should be made in writing.

&gt;*One of the most important documents participants are entitled to receive* **automatically** *when becoming a participant of an ERISA-covered retirement or health benefit plan or a beneficiary receiving benefits under such a plan, is a summary of the plan, called the summary plan description or*  **SPD**. The plan administrator is legally obligated to provide to participants, free of charge, the SPD. 

so, who's cringing now

look, you've made some useful contributions in r/healthinsurance; you know some things. I know some things. Neither of us knows everything. But when you inquire midway into a thread ""Have you ever done anything that you're talking about?"" when you haven't bothered to check any of my post history here to see if you might acquire some of the answer to that question for yourself, you make yourself look bad."
HealthInsurance,Easy now. I just got engaged and we have been trying to figure out whether to get married this year or the next while navigating the tax maze of marriage on top of student debts and obama-care. Three work days is just not enough time. I appreciate the help though... asshole.
HealthInsurance,"You understand that the SPD does not have to be placed in the employees’ hands, correct? If the employees have access to a share drive, simply making the SPD available on the share drive satisfies the requirement. [Source.](https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/checkpoint-ebia-newsletter/will-an-spd-posted-on-our-companys-intranet-satisfy-erisas-requirement-that-spds-be-delivered-to-participants/) For some reason, you seem to think (and probably because you’re old) that somehow the employer not putting it in OP’s hands is breaking the law. It isn’t. Whether he was given the SPD directly or not, it’s not going to change his situation because he failed to submit his enrollment in the **six days allowed.**

Also, when I asked if you had ever done anything you’re talking about, I was specifically asking about making a federal case out of something like this.

Anyway, my point still stands that what’s contained in the SPD is irrelevant to him not submitting his enrollment in a timely manner because he’s lazy. "
HealthInsurance,"Three work days? They sent it out on the 23rd and gave you a deadline of the 28th. That’s six total days. As an adult, you have to learn to prioritize. Your benefits enrollment that’s due in six days should take precedence over a marriage that would (I’m assuming) not happen for months. "

HealthInsurance,I'd refer you to my prior statement.
HealthInsurance,I'm closing the post.  It's gotten too acrimonious.

HealthInsurance,"Isn't ""Moving to the U.S. from a foreign country"" is a qualifying life event for special enrollment period?"
HealthInsurance,"Short term insurance is, essentially, just Non-ACA compliant insurance."
HealthInsurance,"Ok.  So here's the thing.  Never take the provider's word for it; always call your insurer.  I would call your insurer, and get a confirmation.  

Also, can you post a redacted copy of your EOB?"
HealthInsurance,Non HIPAA?  HIPAA has to do with medical privacy; nobody can see your medical records.  There's no such thing anymore....
HealthInsurance,"Insurer has online list of doctors but not facilities that are not big hospitals, and a lot of doctors have address of this health center."
HealthInsurance,"EOB: https://unsee.cc/d9d94c24/

It's for one visit, I had two"
HealthInsurance,"Speaking as a biller for a Drs office, call the billing dept at the Drs office, they'll be able to tell you what's going on. The denial for the office visit is weird because all plans cover office visits, it's the most basic of services. And having the other stuff bundled into it doesn't make sense if they denied it. "
HealthInsurance,That's precisely what I meant. Ugh. So a person who wants health insurance has exactly zero options if they don't meet the criteria of special enrollment? Even this early in the calendar year?
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Doctor says: You owe us nothing now, we are in-network, call you insurer.
I have gut feeling that it's best not to rake up insurer's mess and not to call them. I will wait for bill that may not come at all."
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Have they said the claim has finalized with your insurance? It sounds like it hasn't yet from what they said and they don't even have your second DOS on the EOB. The insurance company will have the answers if you really want to find out now but waiting for everything to finish processing is probably a better approach. We have patients that call a month or so down the line just to confirm they don't owe anything because they haven't received a bill from us. "
HealthInsurance,"Unfortunately, yes, if you don't have any qualifying life events that would trigger a special enrollment period. This is the cost of mandating that ACA compliant insurance ignore preexisting conditions. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes, but I have a nice subsidy. "
HealthInsurance,"You're 18.
The insurance company cannot discuss your protected health information with your parents regardless if you are a dependent, their child, or they pay the premium.

Call the insurance company and ask about protective measures (e.g. Password on the account, different mailing address).

Best of luck with everything."
HealthInsurance,"Epo stands for exclusive provider organization "
HealthInsurance,"HMOs, PPOs and EPOs are three different types of health plans.

HMO or Health Maintenance Organization health plans cover care obtained through providers who contract with your health insurance carrier. Out-of-network coverage is generally limited to emergency situations. The premise behind an HMO is to utilize a group of providers who work together for an

integrative and preventative type of care.

You will require an assigned Primary Care Provider (PCP)
You will need a referred from your PCP in order to see a specialist doctor like a cardiologist
There is no out-of-network coverage
A PPO or Preferred Provider Organization health plans have a provider network made up of preferred providers including doctors and hospitals. You can obtain services from preferred providers at a discounted rate, however seeking treatment outside of your preferred provider network is not prohibited.

You do not require an assigned Primary Care Provider (PCP)
You do not need a referral to see a specialist doctor like a cardiologist
There is out-of-network coverage at a higher cost
An EPO or Exclusive Provider Organization health plan cover medical services only when enrolled individuals treat with providers or in hospitals that are in the plan’s network, except in the case of emergencies.

You do not require an assigned Primary Care Provider (PCP)
You do not need a referral to see a specialist doctor like a cardiologist
There is no out-of-network coverage





So on to providers, you would need to make a choice as to who your pcp will be.

Whose in network? ( you may have already used this)

https://providersearch.ambetterhealth.com/


If that doesn’t work, I would call them up and ask for a list of in network clinics near you. Or have them send you a list of doctors/providers in your area."
HealthInsurance,"Basically you will be paying $6000 by yourself before your plan does anything. You will get a lowered cost if you see a doctor that's under the HMO plan. Your maximum a year is $6500. For prescriptions you will pay $10 for generic (even if this is like acetaminophen and costs less than $10, you will pay $10). Preventative visits are covered (immunizations, annual check up). 

God forbid you have to see a psychiatrist or end up needing surgery or you need a scan. Your insurance requires pre-authorization including doctor, office, hospital, assistants (i.e. other doctors like anesthesiologist). EVERYBODY has to be in the HMO for you to get the best cost. When I say this, I mean if they are not in the HMO, it will not count towards your deductible or out of pocket (so you may end up paying more than $6500 a year even though that's technically your max). 

Edit1: I was wrong, you don't get copay $10 on prescriptions until you pay your $6000 deductible. Good news, this means it might qualify for a HSA. Look into that."
HealthInsurance,"Read section g2 of the law. Scroll down all the way. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A

If you set your withholding correctly and don’t overpay the government you can never have to pay that ACA penalty and you can do so without repercussion. There’s no mechanism in the law to be able to collect or penalize the people who don’t pay it. The government can take it from your return directly if you overpay, and that’s all. 

Also, since Trump said he’s dropping the individual mandate a while back people have filed “ghost returns” where they just didn’t include the healthcare form and the IRS has accepted them according to this article. https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2017-03-28/can-taxpayers-avoid-obamacare-penalties-under-trump

HealthInsurance,Didn’t the penalty go away with the new tax bill?
HealthInsurance,"Great, thank you so much!"
HealthInsurance,"How much is the school’s insurance? Also with your income you’re eligible for reduced rates. Go to the Covered California to get setup and shop for plans. "
HealthInsurance,"My child has a very rare disease (auto-inflammatory) and we have had the pleasure of seeing doctors in London, Austria, and now in America. I was very impressed with our doctors in the U.K. The NHS has his many’s faults (long waits etc.) but it’s nothing compare to the astronomical cost of care in America and a system that requires pre-approval from an insurance company in order to make an appointment with any specialist. 
If you are to see a specialist here, I am going to assume it’s for only a few appointments and a few tests/labs. Some doctors will give you a discount price if you pay cash. Labs also offer this (they always charge the insurance companies more). This also depends on what condition you have and where the doctor is practicing. Good luck! "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;My question is, if I just go to any doctor right now that takes Medicaid, does that mean I am stuck with that same doctor in the future?     

No, you can change.   
Google or call ahead to make sure they accept Medicaid."
HealthInsurance,What state are you in?

HealthInsurance,"The last day to sign up for 2018 was December 31, 2017 in Rhode Island. Unless you have a qualifying event for a special enrollment period."
HealthInsurance,"is it common to appeal and get the approval again? I mean not going to lie back on the generic adderall xr, may be more anxious but sure as hell more productive and somewhat happier on it. maybe this was for the better, not sure what to say to my doctor. "
HealthInsurance,"1. When were you denied Medicaid? 
2. You may qualify for a special enrollment period thro healthcare.gov by being denied Medicaid.

3. The denial was for income, call healthcare.gov phone number and talk to them. It’s free and can’t hurt to see what is going on.  Worst case they won’t have anything.

Be prepared with social security numbers, income, addresses and anything else they may need to get thro an application with you."
HealthInsurance,"That's a tough question to answer but appeals are upheld more often than not. Its all case specific though. "
HealthInsurance,"yeah, even though i'm slightly more comfortable on the other med, just may not be worth it for insurance to pay. Is it that big of a hassle for a doctor to appeal it? "
HealthInsurance,"I believe they can if your new employer offers health insurance - some insurance plans only extend coverage to dependents/spouses who are either unemployed or aren't offered insurance through their own employers "
HealthInsurance,"Sorry, I think I was unclear. I'm paying everything out of pocket upfront with the FSA, but I was told my dental insurance would cut me a check directly for their part of the claim. Since that's money that came from the FSA, do I need to get it back to that account?"
HealthInsurance,No not really. Most will just include your relevant records/chart and the doctor will type up a letter stating why med A is better for you than med B. Pretty straightforward usually.
HealthInsurance,"Do you mean for being exempt from the tax penalty, or do you mean last day to get health insurance?"
HealthInsurance,Incorrect. You can stay on regardless of any circumstances.
HealthInsurance,Forget me... Listen to this person instead
HealthInsurance,"common misconception.  Insurers desperately try to offload the kids, and say ""you must"" but they can't actually enforce it."

HealthInsurance,"Complete the application.

Enroll into a policy within 60 days of the loss of coverage date."
HealthInsurance,Thank you!
HealthInsurance,you will pay your out of network OOP maximum amount.
HealthInsurance,"Awesome. That's what I was hoping. I was confused about the 80%-20% coverage thing. "
HealthInsurance,"that is for co-insurance.  you pay 20% of costs after your deductible (which is not your OOP).  Once you’ve spent your OOP max (in co insurance costs + deductible) you’re done until the policy renews and everything resets "
HealthInsurance,This is where I'm kinda confused. Pardon my ignorance. So essentially what you're saying is I'm looking to pay something like 20% of 100K plus OOP max? Or I have to put forward that 20% until I pay back the maximum?
HealthInsurance,the latter.  you will never pay more than your OOP max. period.
HealthInsurance,thank you for clarifying
HealthInsurance,"I have Cigna. 

The way this goes is you have to pay the full amount until you reach your deductible. After you meet the deductible you are responsible for 20% or whatever your plan requires you to pay. You pay that until you reach your out of pocket max. Once that’s reached everything is covered. 

I had gall bladder surgery last year. Wiped out my out of pocket max in one go. They processed over 90k$ in claims last year. Only had about 4k$ in bills because that was my out of pocket max. "
HealthInsurance,"So long as the service is covered by your policy, you won't pay more than your out of pocket max.  Non covered services do not count to your out of pocket, so just make sure you clarify what is covered prior to anything major"
HealthInsurance,I’m pretty sure they can balance bill you past your OOP max. Am I missing something?
HealthInsurance,"That’s not how out of network works. You have severely misinformed /u/Interquestions, and I don’t usually do this but I’d ask you retract your post. Out of network is priced against either U&amp;C, Medicare, or a third-party pricer. The very definition of out of network is that no contract exists so the provider can and typically does balance bill above the allowable. The insurance will pay 100% _of the allowables_ if the OOP is met. If the surgeon bills $100,000 but the insurance allows $15,000, Cigna will not pay anything above that $15,000 since any insurance that made it standard to allow full billed charges would become insolvent overnight."
HealthInsurance,The benefit of choosing an in-network physician is that they have agreed to accept a discounted rate from the insurer.  If you go to an out-of-network provider then you have to pay the difference between the negotiated rate and the amount the doctor billed for (This is called balance billing).  I would highly recommend funding an in-network provider - You could potentially be liable for tens of thousands in charges.  If there is no in-network provider who can preform this surgery you can try contacting your insurer and requesting a network gap exception - They'll negotiate a one-time contract with a provider and you'll pay as if he were in network and not be liable for any of the excess balance.
HealthInsurance,Can you give us your out of network deductible and out of pocket and coinsurance numbers so we can give you a hypothetical?
HealthInsurance,"OP is going out of network, though."
HealthInsurance,You're correct - I think some of the other posters misread the question.  She is definitely be balanced billed unless they negotiate a better rate with the doctor.
HealthInsurance,Please look at OP’s post and my comment history.  In my first response I specifically mentioned that OP will pay the Out of network OOP.   Perhaps I was not clear enough with OP that he/she needs to speak with Cigna and make sure there is pre-authorization for the procedure and not simply that it has been deemed a covered under his/her plan.  But it is entirely possible that OP has a Cigna PPO plan with out of network coverage and a separate out of network OOP max.
HealthInsurance,"PPO plans can have out of network coverage with a separate out of network OOP max. "
HealthInsurance,"Post this notice you're getting - mask your name/address, other identifiers - and maybe more importantly, who you're getting it  from. ""They"" is a bit vague"
HealthInsurance,"That just means the plan would pay 100% of the allowed amount once he meets OON OOP max. The insurance company is never going to pay 100% of the bilked amount for an out of network claim. There is always going to be a balance bill, and for $100k of jaw surgery, it’s going to be significant. 

Edit: autocorrect changed “billed” to “bilked” but that’s pretty apt so I’m leaving it. "
HealthInsurance,"Hi OP /u/interquestions

Please come back and read the more recent posts on this. "
HealthInsurance,"My issue isn’t with whether or not OP has OON benefits. OP says they do so that’s all we have to go on as far as that goes. My concern is with your statement that OP won’t owe anything above the OON OOP, and that’s patently false. That completely disregards how OON works."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; So long as the service is covered by your policy, you won't pay more than your out of pocket max. 

This is not true for out of network."
HealthInsurance,"Okay, so if the procedure isn't covered in network, it won't be covered out-of-network either. However, I think what you're talking about is the availability of those doctors. If a insurance network does not have the appropriate doctors for what is a covered service, you have to file a network adequacy appeal. Essentially, you are saying that there is a service that you are entitled to, but that you can't get because they don't have the correct doctors. The insurance company will then cover those doctors."
HealthInsurance,"Out of network works the same way, just a high deductible and higher out of pocket max. 

The plan I’m on puts your in network paid amounts towards your out of network deductible and max OOP. And if this surgery is considered “emergency” they may do extended in network. They covered my ambulance and the anesthesiologists with extended in network coverage since my gall bladder was considered an emergency. "
HealthInsurance,"feels like the issue kalabash was concerned about is out-of-network clinicians' ability to balance bill. You may have covered it in your posts, but let's face it, the reality of that practice can be tough for laypersons to wrap their minds around (source: I have trouble with it &amp; have been in the health coverage dodge for dogs' years)"
HealthInsurance,"shouldn't be any problems, but you won't really need it until your return, will you? I mean, would retaining your coverage benefit you in some way, vs merely re-enrolling on your return?"
HealthInsurance,Thank you. It's like everyone is forgetting about balance billing.
HealthInsurance,"I submitted a corrected claim to them for another patient recently because we overclaimed and they just denied that one as a duplicate. When I called in, they said that often times the claims processors don't notice it's coded as corrected and just deny it right away. He had them send that one back for review, but apparently this happens a lot with them. Which is annoying, since Aetna is usually one of the easiest to work with."
HealthInsurance,"I also believe she would have to previously had her own insurance in order to be added to your plan. You should have 60 days though. "
HealthInsurance,"She was on her parents insurance before we got married. Her insurance with then wasn't renewed bc we thought she was enrolled in my plan. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I also believe she would have to previously had her own insurance in order to be added to your plan

what? No.

OP, what does this mean: 

&gt;My marriage license was ""unverified"" 

unverified by whom? What needed ""verification""?

Most group (employer-sponsored) health plans these days require contributions for coverage of dependents. Does your employer's plan require contributions for dependent coverage? If so - you didn't notice that no new amounts were being deducted from your pay? (I know; lots going on, getting married, buying a house, etc - stuff slips)

Basically, I'm thinking you may need to formalize your appeal to get HR to stop twiddling its thumbs. Regarding another poster's situation, a wiser poster than me made clear that a plan's appeals process generally applies only to claims &amp; really doesn't apply to determinations about your eligibility to enroll, or whether enrollment rules have been applied fairly. For ""due process"" on that, you may need to contact your state's insurance regulators, and/or possibly whomever deals with civil rights that accrue to marital status."
HealthInsurance,"As someone very close to the industry, there is a bunch of options, you just need to get on the phone with someone or talk to a local health insurance broker. I wasn't talking about penalties, just coverage in itself."

HealthInsurance,"&gt;From what I understand, if I'm self-employed, I should be able to still purchase health insurance outside of the enrollment period?

Can you advise why you might  ""understand"" that, because, mmm, pretty much no?"
HealthInsurance,"Alright, I might be mistaken. So I am made a Google search for ""can you still get health insurance if self employed"", and the Google snippet result at the top said:

""If you run a business that produces income and has no employees, you're considered self-employed. You can buy health coverage through the individual Health Insurance Marketplace. ... This means you can enroll in a health plan even if it's outside the annual Open Enrollment period.""

And the snippet linked to this goverment page:
https://www.healthcare.gov/self-employed/coverage/

So when I read the snippet, I figured I can still get health insurance? But when I did try to find that text on the linked page, I wasn't able to find that excerpt."
HealthInsurance,"You'd have to be eligible for a special enrollment period. These can be opened up for a variety of reasons, including moving, marriage, new job, etc. You may also quality for a hardship exemption to the fee. You also could qualify for medicaid possibly, depending on your age/income/location."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Alright, I might be mistaken.

No, I'm afraid I probably am mistaken - mostly because I processed what you posted about your reaching age 26 as happening in 20SIXTEEN (note to self: tackle questions only after 2nd cup of coffee). I think it was your reference to being self employed for several years - congrats on that btw.

But no excuses, I screwed up there. I'm sure my professional colleagues who post here will treat me gently (not).

Looks to me like you're still within the window for marketplace coverage. This is probably a good time of year to enroll, as the volume happens during the fall enrollment window.

I read the post and it seems as if the bridge, at least the way I interpreted it from the post, is from the time the old coverage ends until the end of the time you have to elect coverage (60 days). We have been on COBRA (and paid) for a couple months now - does the same bridge principle still apply? Thanks again for your help!"
HealthInsurance,"Are you in school? If you are, check with them about health insurance, you may already be covered. If you aren't - call a local insurance broker and ask about health insurance, if they don't do it, ask for recommendations, if they don't have any - look at private health insurance brokerages online. Just google individual health insurance."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for asking for clarification. So unverified means that our marriage was not validated. They had not processed my marriage license when I faxed it to them for one reason or another and I wasn't aware that it hadn't been received and validated until after the allotted time to add my wife.

I'll edit this into the OP but my company was union. We were bought by a different company and switched insurance in late spring. They then switched us onto another insurance at the beginning of August, and once again at the end of the year when the enrollment period opened for the insurance I currently have. We switched 3 times in one year so my dues for insurance had changed as many times as well. I should have been more diligent when looking at my rates but they had gone up and down multiple times so it was hard to follow. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; does the same bridge principle still apply?

uh, no, not reaally - this is not my day for following details of posts. I thought you had not yet either made an election nor plunked down any dough for your COBRA coverage.

You DO have a premium payment grace period, but I wouldn't be surprised if your former employer/plan administrator hounds you for payment of that month's coverage anyway. Your baby's probably worth the investment, so....

Sorry about my misunderstanding of your situation. Good luck!"
HealthInsurance,"Honestly, I wouldn't spend anymore time on it. You have your notes in the account that you attempted to refund it. Down the road, maybe after a year or more they will do an internal audit and may request the funds back at that time.

 What insurance carrier are you working with? I assume it isnt within the major 5? "
HealthInsurance,"It's not to get you to pay the bill, it's to see if there's another responsible party. If you were in a work incident or car accident for example, someone else might be responsible for the bill. They're just trying to offload the responsibility haha. "
HealthInsurance,"There's no risk to you - As Zebra-Stampede states they're just seeing if another party (Like car insurance or Worker's compensation) is supposed to be paying first.  "
HealthInsurance,How old are you?  What state do you live in?  What is your income?
HealthInsurance,"Aetna. They've been super difficult with refunds in the past on at least a few occasions. And thanks, I'll just close it and if they come back with questions I have notes that say I did everything I could."
HealthInsurance,Do you have active insurance?  If so it doesn't matter how often you use it.  I haven't been to the doc in three years but my insurance would be accepted without hesitation if I walked in today.    As long as your premiums are paid and your provider is in network you should be good to go.
HealthInsurance,"I didn't go to the optometrist for 6 1/2 years until a few months ago, but I kept paying my health insurance premium. I suspect that's the issue here, not that you didn't get checkups."
HealthInsurance,"She said, and I quote: ""Have you used your insurance in the last 2 years? Otherwise you don't qualify."" I told her no, and she said to make the appointment anyway and she'll get back to me. Not to be that guy, but she clearly wasn't a native speaker so maybe I just didn't understand what she meant?"
HealthInsurance,"Everything is good, but she said if I haven't used my insurance in the last 2 years, I won't qualify."
HealthInsurance,"Moving isn't a qualifying event under special enrollment.

Your only option is to work with your HR to convince them you enrolled on time and they screwed up.  Maybe your union could help with that.  Good luck."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;What is the best method to go about getting a new plan? 

based on your post - you're already doing it. 

What does ""best"" mean for you for you? "
HealthInsurance,"Thats surprising that its Aetna. I was going to suggest to send in a corrected claim, with a zero billed amount and write on the claim note line (i forget which box) ""services not rendered, billed in error"" and then that should cause them to recoup the money. 

Thats worked in the past for me, specifically with Aetna. "
HealthInsurance,A lot of vision insurance will only pay for new glasses/contacts every 2 years. Maybe that's what she meant.
HealthInsurance,"Hello,

Congratulations on striking out on your own.  I've done it: it can be terrifying, but totally amazing at the same time.

Regarding your best options.  You will need to buy an individual plan off the exchange.  Your state has it's own exchange, [here.](https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/)  You should not go anyplace other than that website to get your insurance.

You will need to have a triggering event in order to get a special enrollment period: my guess is that you've just lost your health insurance because you started a new job.  New York also has a really weird/cool plan where it's public/private hybrid insurance plan at certain income levels.

Regarding out of network benefits...why?  There are plans that offer out of network benefits, but these are crazy expensive.  The industry has moved away from plans that cover out of network (except for emergencies) in order to control costs.

Is there any particular reason you want OON coverage?  All companies have different networks: if you want a particular provider, you can often find a plan that covers that doctor.  

Having been a contractor/freelancer, I can tell you that the high expense of one of those platinum plated plans isn't necessarily all that necessary.  

Finally, as a freelancer, your application to the exchange will be different.  Most people apply and state their gross income (everything they get as pay, not accounting for taxes).  

However, as a freelancer, you will need to apply with an income that is your gross **minus your business expenses only**.  

If you tell us your county, age, sex, smoking habit, and estimated income minus business expenses only, we can price you out.  If you tell us the specific provider you want, we can take that into account as well. "
HealthInsurance,"I am 28 years old.
I moved to Arizona late last year.
I currently make a little over 30,000 a year."
HealthInsurance,"That doesn't sound right....it should be the opposite.  I'd call to make sure that your insurance is valid, and then also pull the summary of benefits and coverage.  It feels like there's a hiccup here."
HealthInsurance,"Hello:

Welcome to the US.  So, this is all going to be context based.  How long are you going to be here?  Is this a school trip, a tourist event, a work related travel event, or are you going to work here.  Hate to ask, but will you be here with or without documentation (basically, can ICE kick you out :-/ 

Once we know these things, I can help you further."
HealthInsurance,"I am looking for OON benefits because I have some unusual health issues that tend to need some less traditional remedies.

I live in New York City, I am 29, Female, No Smoking and Est Income is around $60k - $80k."
HealthInsurance,"When you say nontraditional remedies, what exactly?  Because no insurance is going to pay for something like a homeopathic doctor.  Insurance does not, by and large, pay for alternative medicine. "
HealthInsurance,"You are eligible to enroll, because you lost your insurance at the end of december.  **YOU MUST ENROLL BY THE END OF FEBRUARY**
https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/"
HealthInsurance,"So I'm not the only one who screws up.  Lol.  "
HealthInsurance,Yeah...you're completely wrong.  Just.....wrong.  The mod has spoken.
HealthInsurance,"I'm 120% not, PM me and I'll let you know who I work for. I'm surprised as a mod for this sub that you don't seem to know that you can buy private health insurance whenever you want. The plans may not be cheap or ""aca compliant"" and may not be covered by any subsidies and could trigger tax penalties at the end of the year. But you'll still be covered if you need health care. There isn't a way you can tell me that statement is wrong while still being honest."
HealthInsurance,"No just like specialists and physical therapy. Nothing insane - just out of the realm of a ""doctors checkup"""
HealthInsurance,"yeah, any insurance will pay for that.  Specialists and PT are covered in every ACA compliant plan."
HealthInsurance,"Let’s say I’ll be in the other side of the wall �� so I need something that can cover emergency, urgent care and if I die that my body could be send to my country. 
"
HealthInsurance,I have to get some specific trigger point injections that are not covered. I need a good out-of network plan for those to be covered
HealthInsurance,"&gt;the coverage that costs $103 will save me a bunch. 

coverage that costs a 26 year old 103 - biweekly? - could be ok, or quite good. Depends where you are - city, state (""all health coverage is local"") - AND what your coverage features  are, and you haven't told us anything about those  features. Post a copy of your Summary of Benefits and Coverage - de-identified if need be - &amp; we can give you a better opinion. [SBCs look like this](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf). Every legit offeror of coverage - an employer, or an insurer - has to have a copy of this document for its plan, &amp; give it to you when you enroll."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;an expanded visit

what is an ""expanded visit""?

You're being treated for a diagnosed condition. That's probably what you're being charged for. Ask your MDs office manager/billing people for your diagnosis codes and/or CPT codes - something that can be priced via"
HealthInsurance,"Here is the plan:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1z6fTvwP_WDG955_OYDbTqbB3gBGfOHCq

Edit** I personally think this is a great insurance plan, with low copay and low coinsurance"
HealthInsurance,"99214 is what they’re coding it as 
Z79.899 is the diagnosis code. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the information.  I learn something new every day in this industry.  I'm honestly going a bit crosseyed with this question.  Emergency stabilization can't be denied anybody, even if they can't pay.  But I read today that the Medicaid administrator and exchange insurer Centene is in trouble for having too few providers in-network, specifically causing patients to be billed more than expected for emergency services rendered by out-of-network-providers.

If this situation isn't Medicaid balance billing specifically, I guess the next best thing to do would be to apply with the providers for need-based financial assistance.  I'm weary just thinking about trying to negotiate this with an ambulance company."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; 99214 

""Established patient, office visit"" - commonly used (50% of the time?) for, y'know, established patients. What clinicians will charge for that kind of visit can vary widely

&gt;Z79.899

""Other long term (current) drug therapy""

I'm no expert but I'm not seeing anything really unusual here"
HealthInsurance,"This basically takes me from just paying my office visit co-pay up to paying that AND 130.00 dollars in co-insurance. 

I think that’s outrageous for a medication refill with no changes. "
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Here's a decent summary of the requirements for the various standard office visit types 99211-14.   If you feel your provider is billing fraudulently, you should file a grievance with your insurance company.   https://www.aafp.org/fpm/2003/0100/p29.html"
HealthInsurance,"Never say never. Complete the letter; add plausible reasons you missed the deadline (holidays; your first time ever; Haley's Comet? etc), cc your state government representative(s), your congressperson, &amp; maybe your US Senators.

You may not win your appeal, but you cannot win if you do not play."
HealthInsurance,"I get your frustration,  I really do.  You can always go to your pharmacist and ask him to call in a refill. Or call the dr office and ask for a refill."
HealthInsurance,"All insurance providers cover medically necessary breast reduction.  They all have specific policies and guidelines about how medically necessary is defined, and it's not always easy to prove things are medically necessary, until there are documented problems like spinal curvature or chronic pain.  A Dr is who is experienced in the procedure Wil be your best friend here,both in terms knowing what different companies require, and what sorts of specific information s/he needs to submit to the insurance company.  It can be slow going, but find a Dr and talk to them about your options.  You may need to consider an out of pocket payment plan too, but there is no reason to think insurance isn't your first option.
"
HealthInsurance,"I hope so, because I’ve read some case studies (instances of people suing the company for not covering breast reductions after the plaintiff went through with a breast reduction) involving my insurance that don’t look so good...I’ve had a request submitted 3 times and they were all denied. And I actually do have a spinal curvature, which began presenting around 2015. Saw a chiropractor and a physical therapist for about 3 months each. 

I looked on the BCBS website and I don’t even see anything about reductions on there. Maybe I didn’t search correctly. My last surgeon said he’d work with me to appeal, so I guess I could try that. I’m just not very optimistic at this point. "
HealthInsurance,I'd ypu tell me the plan name and state (eg BCBS Montana hmo) I might be able to find it
HealthInsurance,That is ridiculously cheap compared to what a lot of other people pay. I pay over $600 for my coverage just for me.
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Basically if they were in-network it sounds like they were responsible for submitting the prior authorization (so they cant charge you if it was denied because it was their responsibility).  Since it was approved it probably went toward your deductible, etc, and it becomes a chargeable expense. That's kind of what it sounds like but I would definitely get whatever you can in writing.  Always."
HealthInsurance,"Writing this because theres nothing else here and I am no expert on this stuff but I quit my job last June and had July covered by the same plan (old employer). "
HealthInsurance,Thanks!
HealthInsurance,"It depends on your employer.  Generally you will get covered  with your current insurance for the remainder of the month that you quit (but confirm this with your HR).  When you get a new job, you will either be enrolled starting the first of the month after you get hired, or the first of the month after a probationary period.  Some employers will start your coverage the day you start working there, this is more often true for very large companies.  So basically, it varies and you need to talk to prospective employers about their policies, and make plans accordingly.  Occasionally you will run into an employer who doesnt offer insurance at all, but gives you a monthly stipend of some sort, so you can buy your own (usually a bad deal for anyone but a young single person)."
HealthInsurance,Thanks- I'll be sure to find that out!
HealthInsurance,Thanks a lot!
HealthInsurance,Thanks!
HealthInsurance,"I'm going to assume you're at an employer large enough to be obliged to offer you continuation coverage if/when you leave, and urge you to bookmark this link to a [walkthru of a COBRA bridge strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/)"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I still have outstanding balance from the old plan, which is nearing the end of its grace period.

I'm not really clear what you mean by the quoted bit, but if you have coverage via your new employer, and it's in force now (you're not in any waiting period), I'm also not clear why you have continued to pay premiums for your now-unnecessary individual policy"
HealthInsurance,"Hiya, so let me unpack what happened here.

1.  Regarding the doctor being in network.  You have just run into what is the most common error made by patients, which, quite frankly, you really shouldn't have to do with but do anyway.  *Never* take a receptionist's word that they take your insurance.  They don't know if they do.  There is no such thing as ""the"" Empire BCBS network; it's like Baskin robbins, 31 flavors.  Different plans have different ""networks"". Essentially, a plan might be cheaper, because it only includes ""cheaper"" doctors; aka, doctors who bill less.  So yes, they might take Empire BCBS plans, but only some of them.  That is what has happened here.  

Never take a doctor's word on insurance, always call and verify with the insurer if that doctor is in network.

2.  Regarding the bill; your insurer has processed the bill as out of network; meaning that greater cost sharing on your part applies; basically, because it's out of network, the insurer only tacks on whatever discount that can get, but doesn't pay any cost, or hardly any cost at all.

3.  Regarding the payment method.  The total bill was 2150.  Your insurer imposed a discount of 750, meaning a base total of 1400.  They paid 320, meaning that they covered 23% of the bill (my guess is that you had some sort of deductible in there somewhere).  

3.  Regarding radiology.  They took 2 different angles of your foot; where these done at the same time?  If they did this at the same time, then what they've done is called unbundling; essentially, they split a procedure apart, so that they could charge more.  2 separate scans is a hell of a lot more expensive than 1 scan with 2 views.  If the scan was taken at the same time, then they messed up.

4.  Regarding cost; the way it works in the US is that providers bill a huge amount of money, but the insurer cuts the cost down to a more reasonable amount, what is called ""usual and customary"".  However, because this provider is out of network, the insurer can't cut down as much.  TBH, the surgery charges (outpatient) sound about right; sterile instruments, the doctor's time, overhead, the possibility of something going wrong, malpractice insurance, front office costs.  The medical supplies are where it would normally be cut down.

5.  What you can do.  While you should have called the insurer, they did, after all, falsely tell you that they took the insurance.  You need to call up the billing department and get ahold of a single person; you need a single point of contact.  Tell them what the problem is, and ask for a dispute/event number.  Write that number down.  Any time you call, reference that number, and record the date/who you spoke to.  You owe them something, but they also screw up.  Ask them to negotiate a price.  

If they refuse, you have recourse.  Inform them that you will *not* pay the full amount.  Anytime you get a collection notice, write back and dispute the charge.  (btw, this won't hurt your parent's credit).  If they send you to collections, dispute it in a letter setting out why.  Essentially, they dun goofed.  "
HealthInsurance,Yeah.  That's a great plan.
HealthInsurance,"My MediCal got cancelled around October. I was eligible for special enrollment on Covered California and signed up for Kaiser. I paid the premium for October to December. I then enrolled with my employer with Kaiser again during open enrollment, but they are still seeking for me to pay the premium for my individual plan. I haven't paid the bill for January and February, hence the outstanding balance, because I thought it was redundant since I am already covered by my employer. My question would be should I just not pay and let the individual plan terminate itself and would doing so affect my current plan with my employer? Thanks!"
HealthInsurance,"the only site is healthcare.gov, or if your state runs its portal, there may be something local.  what state are you in"
HealthInsurance,Maryland. Thanks for the reply!
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"While i agree with 99% of your post, i dont agree with blaming only the provider. It was OPs responsibility to find a network provider. They didnt even try, all they did was pick one based on proximity. I know its a common thing to do but OP shares *some* of the blame here. Lesson learned i hope."
HealthInsurance,https://www.marylandhealthconnection.gov/
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I haven't paid the bill for January and February, hence the outstanding balance

That's not really a ""balance"" - based on what you've said, that's a billing error. So...

&gt;should I just not pay and let the individual plan terminate itself and would doing so affect my current plan with my employer? 

based on what you've posted - yes, and no"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"I totally agree, and I think I covered that.  Like I said, she does owe them something.  But I was trying to set out her way forward.  Personally, I think we need some sort of regulation that would require medical practices to say ""check with your insurer""."
HealthInsurance,"Have you been an active employee of the company? I’ve been able to get people enrolled as of their date of entry by submitting an I-9. If your first official date with the company is in February, you’ll likely just need to visit the Healthcare Marketplace at www.healthcare.gov. I would suggest giving them a call tomorrow to discuss your options. "
HealthInsurance,"I'd say it depends on how frequently you use the doctor/pharmacy. 

On the HDHP plan, your worst case scenario you're out $7350 for a year. 

On the PPO, worst case, you're out $11,550. 

If you only use a yearly preventative check up and one or two sick visits, it's a toss up. Two sick visits probably wouldn't even run you $450 on the HDHP, so you're not saving anything by going on the copay plan. 

If you use medical services frequently, but nothing complicated or beyond two thousand dollars-ish, you might prefer the copay plan. 

If you use medical services frequently or in large monetary amounts, for example with a chronic illness, you might come out better on the HDHP. 

If they're still about equal to you, I'd do the HDHP, which allows you to sock away pre-tax money in an HSA which is never a downside. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks for the reply. I haven't been an active employee of the company, and my start date is next week. 

After I made this post, I emailed the HR manager, and she included a link to the Office of the Insurance Commissioner for WA and recommended looking into the private insurance marketplace until my coverage through my job kicks in. I called the Office of the Insurance Commissioner to ask if I had a qualifying event for the special enrollment period and they said yes, but when I called the WA exchange and asked to confirm if I had a qualifying event, they replied I didn't have a qualifying event and thus can't enroll through the state exchange.

I'll probably go to an insurance broker tomorrow and explain my situation to get health insurance to cover me while I don't have health insurance through my job. 

Thoughts?"
HealthInsurance,"I would think that [“Changes in residence”](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/) would apply here. You can click “Get Started” and see how far the site will let you go. A broker is probably your best bet. I haven’t dealt with individual in about two years now since the market in my state (Texas) is absolutely awful.

I’m assuming you’ll be here legally with a work visa or green card or something of the sort? "
HealthInsurance,"In your scenario described, yes you would pay the full amount. If you go to the ER again before paying anything towards your deductible, your benefits would be the same. Some insurances can take awhile to update what you've paid so keep your receipts and proof of payment. Once you've spent $4,000, then you should only be responsible for the $300 co pay. 

Keep in mind that ER physicians may bill separately from the hospital you're attending. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks!  

I actually like my current plan and it has served me well for the last couple of years.  However, I guess they really want to discourage me from going to ER by making it very costly for me. :)"
HealthInsurance,"If there is an urgent care center or a walk in community clinic nearby, I would try there first when you can't get in to see your PCP unless it really is an emergency. "
HealthInsurance,This.  Take the hdhp and use the hsa.
HealthInsurance,"&gt; The denial for the office visit is weird because all plans cover office visits,

if OP is in a plan with networks of clinicians, and network clinicians are available to perform tthose wellness checkups, and your office's docs *aren't*  OP's plan's network, OP would be on the hook for the cost of a wellness visit to your docs"
HealthInsurance,I'm a U.S. citizen.
HealthInsurance,"It appears that my HSA administrator (Optum) does have a process. Not sure if it's obligation or generosity, but it exists. Form on their website:

""Withdrawal Correction Form - Use this form to redeposit funds withdrawn in error from your account.""

I expect this will be longish process. Keeping a watch for EOB, then pressing provider to cut me a check, then I postal mail check to the HSA, to then be deposited. Fortunately I have the rest of the year to straighten it out."
HealthInsurance,"Are you talking about your deductible for coverage on another plan (other than IHS)?  For example, you have coverage through an employer, and you also have IHS coverage?

In that case, yes - IHS payments on your behalf apply towards the other primary insurance deductible when those claims are sent to your primary insurance first."
HealthInsurance,Yeah then you should absolutely be able to enroll with a qualifying event.
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Are you talking about your deductible for coverage on another plan (other than IHS)? For example, you have coverage through an employer, and you also have IHS coverage?

Yes. I have a work plan through Premera

&gt;In that case, yes - IHS payments on your behalf apply towards the other primary insurance deductible when those claims are sent to your primary insurance first.

So I get a referral to see a specialist, where IHS agrees to be the last resort payer, the bill is $1500, premera pays $0 because I haven't met my deductible, and so my tribe pays the $1500 because it was a referral.

At that point I would have $1500 towards my $6k deductible? 
"
HealthInsurance,"Pretty much, yes.  There are caveats, but that's the gist.

You may want to follow up with Premera after claims go through to get all the exact details as to what applied to your deductible.  You should also be getting statements from Premera (EOBs) that show charges applying toward your deductible."
HealthInsurance,I thought nothing applied towards your deductible until it was actually paid?
HealthInsurance,"Nope.  Doesn't matter if it's never, ever paid.  The insurance co has no way of knowing when/who you have paid (unless it's a provider that is owned by the insurance co, but it's still all separate).

The insurance just decides what is owed to the provider.  They are completely removed after that."
HealthInsurance,"Okay, so when I go to my IHS clinic, and they pill $400, premera says that my deductible isn't met and I am responsible for the rate they agree to pay (I think it is called something else) of $200, but my tribe doesn't actually care if I pay that or not, $200 is knocked off my deductible?"
HealthInsurance,Yes.
HealthInsurance,"&gt; It appears that my HSA administrator (Optum) does have a process.

good-ish news, hope it works out
"
HealthInsurance,Thank you for all of your help.
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Hey thanks for your reply, this has been a long process that is finally coming into view.

1) I will leave Illinois this coming Monday the 12th
2) Arriving in MA Wednesday the 14th
3) I become covered the following month following 2 months of employment i.e. I became employed January 29th, so March 29th would be two months and April 1st would be the following month of that. My employer is based regionally in NYC, MA is just my location of employment.

Hope that helps."
HealthInsurance,"I've never even heard of this option before, thanks!"
HealthInsurance,Any idea on how long it takes for that coverage to begin through the marketplace?
HealthInsurance,"It's complicated. You'll be enrolling via a special enrollment period -- you'd qualify based on both loss of prior coverage and moving.

If you enroll based on moving, you have to enroll after the move. Your coverage is effective the first day of the following month if a plan is selected between the 1st and 15th, or the first day of the second following month if a plan is selected between the 16th and the last day of the month.

If you enroll based on losing coverage, you can enroll before or after loss of coverage. If you enroll before, your coverage goes into effect the first day of the month following the loss of previous coverage. If you enroll after, it goes into effect the first day of the month following enrollment.

FYI, the Marketplace now makes you send in documents to prove you qualify for the special enrollment period -- see slides 31 on [here] (http://www.healthreformbeyondthebasics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Webinar-OE5-2017-07-07_SEPs-Updates-Verification.pdf) for documents that work to prove it."
HealthInsurance,"So 1/2 of Feb &amp; March are your coverage concerns. Loss of Medicaid triggers a special enrollment event which would enable you to obtain ACA coverage. Depending on your expected 2018 income from your great new job you may qualify for tax credits - or not.

Short term health policies are typically good for 3 months. You may find something via someplace like eHealthinsurance that is not too onerous to apply for, gives you the option to pay a month at a time, and isn't too punitive with pre-existing condition limits.

tl;dr I'm hoping someone here has better suggestions for you than I've provided

"
HealthInsurance,"Their returns will be kicked back to them, asking for a 1095. It's a form you receive if you have health insurance that proves it. Here are some things that could exempt you from the fine: https://www.healthcare.gov/health-coverage-exemptions/exemptions-from-the-fee/"
HealthInsurance,"Ho boy.  Yes, it's a common problem.  The marketplace spits out an answer that says ""we'll contact you re: medicaid"".  The problem is that the Exchange is run by the federal government, and medicaid is run by the states.  More often than not, the file gets lost.  (by the feds, almost all of the time).  

So yes, you need to fill out an application with your state's medicaid directly.  And yes, that is insane.  

Re: penalty; if you are under the FPL (which means medicaid eligible), there isn't a penalty - it's waived.

If you have further questions, please let me know."
HealthInsurance,"I'm glad somebody understood this, because I was lost.  IHS is a mystery to me."
HealthInsurance,"thank you for the answer, few more questions.

a. The strange thing is that in the eligibility result notice, in bold text it says ""Eligibility notice: You’re eligible for free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)""
but under Results, it says ""May be eligible for free or low-cost coverage through NJ FamilyCare (Medicaid), but you may need to provide more information to your state. This result is based on the monthly household income of $xxxxx that you provided on your Marketplace application. It says ""may be"", what is going on really. 

b. So I gotta go here http://www.njfamilycare.org/apply.aspx and apply online myself huh? I mean the lady did resend the application so should I take the chance of just waiting for it? As you said, as I'm eligible, there shouldn't be penalty right? It's just by sending 2 different application and all of sudden if they say the first application appeared in the system, they might just complicate things further..."
HealthInsurance,"What I think is crazy is our companies insurance agent said because we are IHS, we don't have an open enrollment period and can add or drop coverage whenever we feel like it."
HealthInsurance,"a.  No, just apply online.  The feds always lose it.  

b.  Also, if there's a duplicate, they can condense it pretty quickly.  It's linked to your SSN.  Balance of probabilities says that it's a better idea to do the online application yourself.  "
HealthInsurance,"It seems like [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/7w3dh3/how_do_deductibles_work_with_ihs/dtxj8cl) is saying it doesn't matter whether or not you have actually paid any of the bills to meet the deductible, are you saying save the bills, do I have a reason to be confused."
HealthInsurance,"Bills are updated to the insurance company and applied through in order received by the company. First to file, basically. They are not necessarily filed in chronological order. Rarely, but sometimes you'll pay one doctor at 100%, when by the times all the claims are done and filed, you had others hit first and now only owe co-insurance at 20%. 

But yes, as long as the claim is filed, it counts against the deductible. 

In OP's example, the second ER visit could post first, and then you end up in a similar situation. 

It's also just good practice to keep receipts for any medical procedures. Especially on HDHP's, since generally you're not paying up front (unless they require deposit), as they bill based on the CPT code which is only known after your visit. In a copay structure, you pay a flat fee regardless of the CPT code filed. "
HealthInsurance,"I see, another random question to ask. When they ask me for estimated monthly household income for 2018, which specific income are they talking about? I'm a 26 year old man and started applying for health insurance for this year as 26 year old can't be dependent for insurance under my parents. I'm single, have no dependent so do I just input my monthly income? I live with my parents now working part time.

"
HealthInsurance,"An ER is costly in general, no matter who pays for it.
"
HealthInsurance,No its not. I'd tell that person to contact a lawyer for wrongful termination.
HealthInsurance,"Thank you. Unfortunately that employee ~~me~~ was fired almost 2 years ago so there would be no point in pursuing a case. But I did think it was bizarre that when I was in HR's office getting fired they said, ""go ahead and apply for unemployment, we won't try to fight it."" "
HealthInsurance,"but it's always better if the insurance company picks up the bill, right? :)

a long time ago, I fainted from alleged food poisoning.   The ER nurses and doctors took my temperature, blood pressure and gave me some IV injection of fluids.  I was discharged 1 hour later.   The final bill came to a little over $6,000.(ER room charges, doctor's bills, etc)   Grandpa was right in 1970... I shoudl have gone to medical school."
HealthInsurance,"Cause that was the excuse they were giving to fire you, when it was probably something else."
HealthInsurance,"Unless there was an employment contract or they were in Montana, wrongful termination would only apply if they were fired for an illegal reason- like due to membership in a protected class."
HealthInsurance,"Most states are at will employment meaning they can let you go for prettmuch anything. Where I am in PA we would absolutely fire someone for something like this. "

HealthInsurance,you have to have income for obamacare and be between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line
HealthInsurance,"Are you being forced to quit for some reason? I don't understand the concept here. You have great health insurance to which you need, and want to quit your job that is providing this, because you're tired of working?

Really need more information to provide better advice but from your post you're going to be paying out of pocket or losing your medication unless you qualify for some type of state aid, which if you voluntarily quit your job you probably wont qualify. "
HealthInsurance,"No, you are not required to be on his insurance. You can keep your Marketplace plan.  Just bear in mind that there might be subsidy implications for you. Do you receive a subsidy on your plan from the marketplace?"
HealthInsurance,"Yes, I do. This is what I am worried about losing. Without the subsidy, I probably cant afford to pay for my own plan out of pocket.
"
HealthInsurance,"yeah.  We'll have to price you out separately.   What's you age and county? 

And is it just the two of you?"
HealthInsurance,"Sorry, what do you mean by we'll have to price you out separately?"
HealthInsurance,"Ok, I was initially looking at the highest /platinum tier which is $1886/mo after tax credits. The gold plan is indeed $1443/mo after tax credits. 

I'm checking Health First 's online quote website. 
It also breaks down rates for Myself + wife, each individually, and CHIP. 
Individually, or Myself+Wife and Chip, is significantly cheaper than the Family Plan. What is the difference and can we go that route?"
HealthInsurance,"Queens NY 11357. 32, 31, and 18month boy. 

A little confused on why individual plans, when added together, seem significantly cheaper than a family plan ?"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; What is the difference and can we go that route?

1) You CAN go that route, and

2) I'm not sure what you're looking at precisely so cannot say definitively. Ordinarily the way to acheive budget savings is for a high health, low-risk family member to select an individual plan with high deductibles, while the family member(s) with greater need for/likelihood of treatment visits to choose a plan with more generous benefits. I'm told I'm all wet, but I believe there's some degree of defensive ""moral hazard"" pricing in health insurer's premiums; that is, insurers add something to the pricetag of plans with more generous benefits on the semi-supported theory that if you're *choosing* more generous benefits, and accepting higher premiums, you're likelier to **use** those more generous benefits"
HealthInsurance,"Yes, you are still responsible until the day it’s been canceled.  You should ether get a prorated bill or more likely, pay full month, then they work out how much you owed for month and send a check as refund.  This can take awhile depending on how fast your insurance company is.   

If you have any questions or wish to know the status of your bill, contact your former insurance company after the termination date.  If you canceled today , call your insurance company around February 14, and see where their at. 

"
HealthInsurance,"danes wants to provide you ballpark pricing for your marketplace coverage without premium tax credits, which you  can then compare to the price for adding you as a dependent on your husband's plan. 

Premiums are quite specific to place &amp; age &amp; generosity of coverage features."
HealthInsurance,"Google the “family glitch”— unfortunately you will not qualify for subsidies. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes, pregnancy is a preexisting condition. If you have an ACA-compliant plan, that is not an issue."
HealthInsurance,"1) move the hell out of TX. Possibly the worst state in the nation for individual health insurance.

2) all health coverage is ""local"". Your options, and their costs to you, depend a lot on your particular circumstances, of geographic location - **city** &amp; state -  age, expected income, expected health treatment needs, and more. So tell us your story
"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;the customer service rep. from the COBRA administrator is telling me I do 

That's dopey. Nice try, administrator person  -  but you lose.

Your premium payment covers you for the month of november. Anything within that month is fair claims game. You aren't obliged to have paid for December or January."

HealthInsurance,"A wellness visit is about going to the Dr when you are well, to talk about your history, and preventative health care needs.  If it becomes problem focused, Eg treatment for a specific problem, then it may cost money.  Lots depends on how your Dr writes out the bill and sends it to insurance.   If you clarify t h at you want to make a wellness visit when you schedule your appt, your Dr will hopefully coach you to make a second follow up appt *if* you need to focus on your treatment needs."
HealthInsurance,"You can/should disclose any current or past health issues.  But make it clear you are only there at that time for a well/healthy visit.  If there is something that needs attention, tell your doctor you prefer to make a separate appt for whatever it is at a later time."
HealthInsurance,"Re Texas. You're not wrong. "
HealthInsurance,"This is not true. Providers who are contracted with medicaid cant bill patients. If they arent medicaid providers then CMS/state cant do anything about balance billing.

Source: i worked balance billing grievances for 3 years at a major medicaid MCP. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Her HR department told her that she should waive the insurance because it would be better for her to just have mine than be covered under both since my plan is better. 

Dual coverage is useful to the extent a second source of coverage fills in substantial amounts of reimbursable treatment charges that the first source doesn't.

In past 20+ years, most employers who offer health coverage have moved to some version of what is called ""non-duplication"" coordination of benefits - the bottom line of which is that dual coverage seldom provides the ""dual-covered"" person much economic value.

Some questions:

- What does your wife contribute - per pay period/per month/whatever - to have her coverage?

- What would you contribute to have her covered as your dependent?

- How do the benefit provisions of her coverage compare with yours? 

[Here's an illustration of a comparison of plan features and costs that may help you model which plan is better](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif)

HealthInsurance,"Probably marketplace coverage - there are few if any states left in which employers  are offering single person ""group"" health policies.

Depending on your field, and where you are located, you may find a trade or professional association offers competitive coverage choices"
HealthInsurance,side comment: I have a FSA with WageWorks.  Thanks for the heads up.
HealthInsurance,"You're going to want to go with the marketplace .   If you tell us your city and state, we can price it out for you"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,Not to mention that they’ve essentially eliminated medmal torts so you’re screwed when a doctor messes you up.
HealthInsurance,"Assuming you mean you're enrolled in Medi-Cal, no"
HealthInsurance,medi-cal counts as insurance under the law.  you're good
HealthInsurance,"You should get an explanation of benefits from your insurance and unless you signed a waiver at the provider’s office stating that you agree to pay for an unauthorized procedure, you are only responsible for the member responsibility portion on your EOB. If the provider is in network they can’t charge you for anything that isn’t specified as your responsibility by the insurance. Getting the provider to give you this in writing will be tough, but your EOB will suffice should they try and charge you. Charging you for more than your insurance company says is your responsibility jeopardizes their contract with the insurance company.  "
HealthInsurance,Call the insurer and ask them what your term date is (without discussing the bill). If your coverage ended before that last month they are saying you owe then there is nothing owed to them.
HealthInsurance,"Definitely call your insurance before paying anything above your copay amount! Unfortunately there are a lot of people hired in medical billing that have no experience! "
HealthInsurance,It would help if you said which state you were in since so much depends on where you live.
HealthInsurance,"There's nothing for them to actually collect on if there were no medical charges on the account.  Insurance is paid in advance.  You pay for February in January, March in February, etc.  If you don't pay, your policy is canceled for the next month.  There's nothing for the insurance company to collect on here and it would be the equivalent of coverage being terminated for that last month.  "
HealthInsurance,"Ultimately it's always your responsibility to determine if a provider is in network; them telling you they were out of network was a good heads up. Out of network means there is no contract with the insurance and the provider, so there are no contract negotiated rates. So her assumption that she'd pay him as an in network physician was a bad one. As a matter of good business practices, I wouldn't have accepted a 'not to worry about it' statement. 

You can't always get a quote in advance of a procedure or appointment, since the coding for that will depend on the complexity and length of appointment, among other factors. For things like dentistry, you can request that the provider submit a pre-determination prior to the dental work, which should give you an idea of what the final bill will look like. They're generally not under any obligation to do that for you without you asking, however. 

Your best option is to negotiate payment with the dentist. "
HealthInsurance,"There’s no asset test for non-elderly non-disabled adults :) you’re good. "
HealthInsurance,"I second this.  It's very unfortunate.  

Here's what I might do.  It looks like the insurance only paid their portion of what are called ""reasonable and customary"" charges.  You might ask the dental office to cut their bill down to ""reasonable and customary"".  After that, you'll have to negotiate.

I sympathize.  Being told ""not to worry"" is unfortunate; it technically means nothing, but sounds like ""oh, it isn't a great deal"".  I know this isn't helpful now, but always go to an in network provider.  "

HealthInsurance,"Thank you. Met with the broker yesterday. Great advice. "
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,Isn't this kind of besides the point?
HealthInsurance,You can checkout health insurance marketplaces like eHealth or contact a local health insurance broker in your area - you can still signup.
HealthInsurance,It depends on which company you get hired with - But generally a large employer will offer a special enrollment period (30 days is standard).  For smaller employers (The ones that offer coverage through the Marketplace SHOP exchange) you can enroll as a new employee outside of open enrollment  (Although your employer can set a waiting period of up to 90 days).  None of this will allow you to enroll in an individual plan though.
HealthInsurance,Healthcare.gov will work perfectly then - Options in your county are pretty affordable and there are quite a few options.  Also - Before buying you should check the plan directory and plan formulary to make sure your doctor and medications are covered (Healthcare.gov has an easy tool to use when shopping).
HealthInsurance,"Once you are enrolled; you can't drop your employer health plan (assuming it's a 125 plan, which is safe because all of them are).  

The only way to cancel would be to have a triggering event, or becoming ineligible.  If you have a sympathetic boss, you might be able to transfer to part time, lose your insurance, and then switch to full time again.  

The crazy thing is, this plan is so expensive that it is outside the ""affordability"" guidelines; if you were on your own, you'd be entitled to waive employer coverage, and go on the exchange *with* a subsidy and cost sharing.

IDK who you work for, but that plan sucks.   "
HealthInsurance,"Hello, and welcome to the magical world of health insurance.  These are the steps in which this is handled.

TL:DR you have a fairly good handle on this.

1.  A person is shot in a mass event.  Victims are transferred to the hospital.  A hospital is required to accept anyone into an Emergency Room regardless of ability to pay, and is required to provide immediate lifesaving surgery if necessary.

2.  Lets say that victim A has health insurance.  Victim A hands over their health insurance card, and the hospital bills the insurer.  Regardless of whether someone else has caused the problem, the insurer has the obligation to process and pay the claim.

3.  Money from other sources.  Lets say that Victim A sues the school district and wins.  Any portion of that money billed to ""medical expenses"" is looked at by the insurance company.  They will seek subrogation - aka, ""we paid for this, and you recovered from your medical expenses so we deserve a piece of that"".  This is very standard.  Additionally, the health insurer for a teacher who was injured at the school might go to the workman's comp insurer and ask them to pay out (spoiler alert, if it happened on the job, they will).

4.  The balance.  There might be a part of the expense that the health insurer doesn't pay.  Lets say that Victim A owes the hospital 1K for expenses (deductible, for example).  The hospital can go after Victim A for these expenses.  *However*, what we saw in Orlando was that the hospital billed the victims private insurance, but didn't seek reimbursement from the victims for whatever their out of pocket costs should have been."
HealthInsurance,"Thanks! Much appreciated. "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, I like to think I have a decent handle on insurance... I deal with insurance every day but only for very specific mental health claims so it's easy; $$ either comes from the insurance company or from the patient.

So my question really is ""who doesn't get paid"" because obviously a hospital or insurance company can absorb the cost of a couple hundred thousand dollars for an event like this much more easily than the 30 or so victims, and we can't just send them all to collections (I mean, we can but I hope that's not what happens). I think it's admirable that hospitals will sometimes write off these costs, but I'd like to see the insurance companies take some of that hit because, you know, they're american companies and they *should* care about american people."
HealthInsurance,"I have this and It is strange. You should call them. It might be different by state and plan but for me I can fill generics at the pharmacy but name brand drugs that are also ""maintenance"" drugs (drugs that need to be taken regularly) need to be filled through mail in. Call and they should give you a mail in#, then envision should send them to your home. It was really confusing for me at first but I would just call them, it's a hassle but that's what I did. I was also on my dad's insurance. Also for some meds that need to be filled soon or not maintenance (like antibiotics) you should be allowed to fill them at a pharmacy. I know that for me my preferred generic pharmacy is Walgreens. "
HealthInsurance,"While technically the hospital could pursue mass casualty victims, most don't because (A) that's a terrible thing to do, (B) the PR blowback would be horrendous, and (C) usually, they are able to recoup at least some off their shortfall from a different carrier or settlement. "
HealthInsurance,"how much do you make?  Because Washington state expanded Medicaid.  You're eligible if you make 1387 or less monthly.  "
HealthInsurance,"I agree, but why are insurance companies not vilified for making their members pay massive deductibles/not covering patient responsibility in this sort of event? Hospitals would get terrible press for going after victims, but no one expects insurance companies to step up and pitch in?"
HealthInsurance,"TBH, it's not the insurance companies.  Almost all people get their insurance through their employers.  And the employers are the ones who chose the plan design.  If the employers wanted to have ""richer"" coverage, they'd have to pay for it.

And insurance companies mostly just administer the plan; the companies provide the funds and the insurers simply send the check out."
HealthInsurance,"Healthgrades is a great place to start.  Look at your list from Next Level and cross reference that against the healthgrades.  Also, google the doctors and see the reviews.  Ask around to see if anyone knows a good doc.  Finally, considered which health system they're affiliated with; that will be important in case you need extended care.

Best of luck. "
HealthInsurance,"Pay what you owe for the premiums and have your doctor resubmit the claim. 

I understand your frustration, but you’ve been offered to be made whole. You’re not getting free stuff out of this."
HealthInsurance,"You did have insurance in January.  After the mistake was fixed the policy would have been effective January 1 retroactively.  I don't think it is possible this year to have marketplace insurance with an effective date other than January 1 unless you are applying due to a life event which changes your insurance situation - the kind that would let you apply mid year.

So you should just ask your doctor's office to resubmit the claim that was denied in the middle of the mistake."
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Ask around to see if anyone knows a good doc.

Word of mouth is probably the number one way.

&gt; considered which health system they're affiliated with

This is especially important with insurance.  My own doctor orders tests from his affiliated hospital's laboratory, but my insurance won't cover the hospital's laboratory so I have to remind him to order the laboratory tests from another company."
HealthInsurance,"Ask your doctor for a letter of medical necessity, supporting the fact that your dad needs the medications. If theres a supervisor you can get ahold of at the insurance, you can possibly fax that letter into them. 

In the mean time, if possible I'd suggest paying for the medications out of pocket. Ask the pharmacy if there are generics, or a discount for self pay /under covered patients. Goodrx.com also offers prescription savings. 

Edit: typos"
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, but I believe the doctor has already faxed the insurance company about how he needs the medications, and they still turned it down. I'll try to see if he can get those saving, but without them we may not be able to afford it out of pocket. 

Thanks again, i hope this helps."
HealthInsurance,"UPDATE: My dad is a disabled Vet, so he is going to try and get the help of the VA. I'd suggest people still comment ideas if they have any, in case someone in the future needs this kind of help. 

Thanks to everyone!"
HealthInsurance,"Ok, I'm seeing tax credits worth around $200/month, making silver plan premiumss into the $200/month range - Bronze plans low to mid $100s range.

HealthInsurance,Were you just recently denied for Medicaid?
HealthInsurance,It's possible your plan has a deductible  and you're paying the full cost until you meet it.  Have you tried logging into your insurer's website or calling them and seeing what they say?

you'll need to dig out pay stubs or whatever record you have of when those contributions were deducted. Put those together with your copy of the document that confirms you opted out. Then make your case to HR/payroll. Tough timing given they've probably closed their books on 2017; they'll hem &amp; haw &amp; try to weasel out of helping you resolve this. Be patient &amp; polite - but persistent"
HealthInsurance,"Did you ever receive anything documenting your previous coverage was terminated? something's missing here.

where are you - what state? States run their own Medicaid programs, using mostly Federal dough. That means they vary their rules &amp; processes, so if you know how 1 state works, you know how 1 state works. Help us understand how your old coverage ended &amp; you were left with no qualifying event &amp; no option to enroll in marketplace coverage"
HealthInsurance,"while you're following up on danes' request for more info, I'm gonna guess it has to do with your foot injury resulting from a car accident - so compensable evia auto insurance.

HealthInsurance,"It's not real insurance. It's short-term, and won't cover any pre-existing conditions, and we'll try and squirrel out of paying anything else. Post the brochure, and I'll give you more information."
HealthInsurance," I am an idiot. I completely blew past that. I have to start paying more attention 2 posts. You are going to need to call his insurance company, or your insurance company, I'm talking about Auto here. Depending on the state. You need to let them know what happened, and they will pay for it. They are the responsible party, not your health insurer."
HealthInsurance,"http://imgur.com/a/zqVz5 here is the book, with information on the front page blocked"
HealthInsurance,"Ok, it's not terrible. If they can find anything pre-existing related to an injury they'll wiggle out of paying.  

I'm not familiar with this company per se. If this is something you're worried about, go ahead and get it.  That said,  most employers offer short term disability plans for free."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah im a self employed carpenter and motorcyclist with zero health coverage, so I was thinking this would be a good idea. Thanks for the help!"
HealthInsurance,"You're going to want to get the exclusions then. They might not cover an accident resulting from anything they considered dangerous. Also, you know that we can help you with getting actual healthinsurance."
HealthInsurance,"You should be eligible for coverage on the marketplace.....can you supply income, ages and sexes, and county?"
HealthInsurance,Or is because it's not currently the open enrollment period?
HealthInsurance,"I made a mistake and applied for Medicaid before my last two weeks were over. I received a letter from Medicaid asking for the last month’s  pay stubs.  I averaged $950/per pay period. Would I have to apply again? What happens if I send them my pay stubs? "
HealthInsurance,If the HR at the company knows anything about anything and is worth their weight - they wont say a word and wouldn't let him leave without a check for what was deducted.
HealthInsurance,I'd look for a health insurance marketplace / brokerage (correct term) - Google: Family health insurance plan and see who can give you a quote quickly. Also if you have a local insurance broker for your car or home owner's - give them a call and get a recommendation.
HealthInsurance,Yes. I guess  thought there was an easier way.
HealthInsurance,"I had premier insurance for 20 years but when I left my company last year...I lost the insurance :/ so I am new to this. Shopping for insurance is the pits.

HealthInsurance,"Yeah I have no idea other than what’s on the tax form of when they were deducted because I never once received a pay stub, it was all direct deposit. I contacted the company (it’s a small town pharmacy) and I should receive a call from the owner tomorrow. Fingers crossed! &amp; thank you guys!"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,You need to go to your States ACA Exchange. You can find it from healthcare.gov
HealthInsurance,Call your caseworker and explain the situation
HealthInsurance,Your company still produces pay stubs even though you were on direct deposit - that should be readily available to you at any given notice.
HealthInsurance,"You should say what state your in. PA has expanded medicaid meaning if you have a low income it can be free. "
HealthInsurance,"Its probably a projected payment you had to pay upfront. Since you didn't meet your deductible yet, the office may have a policy to collect a certain amount upfront. 

Call the office and make sure there wasnt any non covered charges, if there wasn't any, ask for a refund of the $150.00 charge. "
HealthInsurance,Thanks .I will call them.
HealthInsurance,"For outpatient procedures you'll receive 2 bills. One from the facility or place you had the procedure done, and one from your dr. 

It looks like your dr booked the procedure at a location thats out of network on your plan. It happens, because they only know where they are credentialed to perform the procedure, but they don't know what plans are in network there. When checking if a place is in network, always double check with your insurance plan too, even if the scheduler says its in network. 

You can call the facility you had the procedure from as confirm the bill and double check if they're in network. If they insist they are, then tell them of your bill, and they may have to appeal it. If its true and they are out of network, you can always ask if there's a self pay discount. "
HealthInsurance,I checked my insurance website and they list that doctor at that address as in network. It seems really sketchy if it's not covered.
HealthInsurance,Also my plan says it covers 70/30 after out of network deductible but it didn't pay anything. Why is that?
HealthInsurance,Have you met your deductible?
HealthInsurance,No but my out of network deductible is only 3k
HealthInsurance,I believe she will become eligible for [this](https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-coverage-prescription-drugs) once she turns 65.

HealthInsurance,"CVS bought aetna

HealthInsurance,Crafty bot.
HealthInsurance,"Your question begs the question, where was your wife trying to get the flu shot?

A flu shot is a medical immunization. So, the immunization must be billed under the medical plan. As others have said, your doctor can administer and bill for that immunization. 

For convenience, you can also use a national immunization provider if your medical plan does not have a narrow network of participating providers. These are your big chain pharmacies (e.g. RiteAid, CVS, Walgreens, etc.) that, although are pharmacies, have contracts to bill (and be reimbursed) for certain immunizations.

Unfortunately, your local (mom and pop) pharmacy may have the immunization, but probably doesn't have the contract to bill your medical insurance. So, a flu shot at a local pharmacy would not be covered under your medical plan.

What else is going on?"
HealthInsurance,"That means that for whatever that service is, you would pay the copay, which is $0. A copay is a set dollar amount that you pay for a service, a coinsurance is a percentage that you pay for a service. So if a Primary Care visit was a $0 copay, you pay $0. If it was a 20% coinsurance, and the total bill was $100, you would pay $20, or 20%. Hope this helps!"
HealthInsurance,"Looks like a clerical error. I wouldn't worry about it until you get a bill, or you can check your EOB."
HealthInsurance,The fact that you were drinking won't affect your coverage.
HealthInsurance,It shows same in EOB.
HealthInsurance,"If your health reimbursement account is a flexible spending account, you can't use it to pay for premiums."
HealthInsurance,"It's likely that some, maybe several, services entail a non-zero copay under your coverage"
HealthInsurance,"Unfortunately you don't qualify for the special enrollment period I was thinking of -- I hope someone has a better answer for you, but I don't think you qualify for an SEP. "
HealthInsurance,It should be the $29 you owe but I agree it's screwy. I say that because the 740 was the total billed and in network there's no way you are 100% of charges.
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I am pretty healthy and I think I only really need a catastrophic plan.

did your employer indicate you would be COBRA eligible? If so, you may be interested in reviewing a [COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) for your near-term needs, &amp; to give you maybe some more time to do your planning"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; Not sure if any of the other large carriers not mentioned like UHC or Humana have their own.

whether they  do or not - and they basically do, or they contract for the services, certainly for most of their self-funded employer clients - there are somewhere around a dozen teleclinician visit services currently scrambling for market share. Most have some ""retail"" version of their services that don't require you to have health insurance to use them, or even an ongoing membership in their own service, for around $50 a pop. Many won't be around in a year or so, but there will still be plenty such options."
HealthInsurance,"Unless he is in an HSA plan where there is a high deductible that has to be met before the plan pays.  BCBSRI does have some plans that HSA compliant like that.  "
HealthInsurance,But I would still expect an insurance negotiated amount. Which may be why he owes the $29. That could be going to his deductible sure.
HealthInsurance,Different from an HSA. In some odd way.
HealthInsurance,"That is true there would still be a negotiated price. "
HealthInsurance,"You would get much better answers if you said which state you were in. "
HealthInsurance,Virginia
HealthInsurance,"you haven't told us when the testing was done, so we've no idea what the time span is"
HealthInsurance,2-3 weeks ago. Right before holidays
HealthInsurance,Just wait until your EOB is available. It will break down what they paid/covered vs what you owe. If it looks wrong you can call member services to have it reprocessed.
HealthInsurance,Very weird. I would definitely call member services and ask them to reprocess.
HealthInsurance,"Insurance covers this, drunk or sober."
HealthInsurance,Sometimes you can get a better deal by calling and asking their cash price. Usually if you do this it won’t go through or insurance or count towards your deductible...but sometimes is cheaper. Good luck!
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,Not sure why they wouldn’t? This doesn’t sound out of the ordinary here
HealthInsurance,"I think you have to check if you're eligible for Medicaid in your state. As far as I understand, at least in my state:
1. Only real (they will ask for proofs) current income counts, not something you see in crystal ball
2. Everything is ""reset"" on 1 Jan, and if you were making six figures before, it doesn't matter.

BTW if you put something below 138% FPL as income healthcare.gov will likely (for ""expanded medicaid"" states I believe) send you to your state Medicaid agency.

For Obamacare they have some guidelines:

https://www.healthcare.gov/unemployed/coverage/#unemployedincome

But they will ask for proofs of income anyway. And I have no idea what is the proof of income for unemployed."

HealthInsurance,2 weeks ago was 12/20; there have been ~7  business days since then. There may be more processing to be done
HealthInsurance,She needs to file an appeal with the the Department of Health and Human Services.
HealthInsurance,"You need to get a statement of services (aka, what they did) and file that with your insurer."
HealthInsurance,Ask for a summary of benefits and coverage for the plan.
HealthInsurance,"Ask the healthcare marketplace to resend the application to Cigna.  "
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, that's why I mentioned Montana- it's the only one that isn't at will. 

Also, haha, my employer is based out of PA and I was thinking they would absolutely fire someone in a heartbeat for that."
HealthInsurance,"First do a bit of shopping on [Covered California](https://www.coveredca.com/). It's the best sort of health coverage knkowledge self-improvement you can do; it'll give you an idea of coverage options, premium prices, and premium tax credits you may be eligible for.

Then, come back with questions!"
HealthInsurance,take a look [a COBRA bridging strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6ah2jd/how_to_deal_with_coverage_between_jobs/dhekzxr/) &amp; come back with questions
HealthInsurance,"Yes, according to my employer this would be a HIPAA breach. A first name is protected information."
HealthInsurance,"Absolutely yes, this is a violation of the patient's privacy. If the first name was unique enough to post about it to your friends on Facebook, it was likely unusual enough to identify the person. Maybe they didn't live anywhere near your office, but certainly your friends knew what company you worked for., and could easily determine the type of medical work you were involved with. That's definitely enough to justify a complaint."
HealthInsurance,Maybe that's why it pays more
HealthInsurance,"This was a HIPAA violation, and quite frankly, I would have fired you too. You might need a refresher course in how the privacy laws work. I'm assuming that people know where you work. A condition plus a first name plus the date of service is more than enough to make it possible for the patient to be identified. You lost your job, and quite frankly, you deserve to."
HealthInsurance,You are 100% completely and totally wrong.
HealthInsurance,"This is really helpful, and I think it will work for me. Thank you so much!"
HealthInsurance,"It was over 2 years ago and I’ve since left the industry. Honestly I probably did need a refresher. The company I worked for has recently garnered a very negative reputation amongst its employees for firing them for a whole slew of reasons and not offering industry refreshers or chances to further ourselves in the industry. But that’s besides the point! It was just something I had thought about today and wanted to get some opinions from current professionals. Thank you! "
HealthInsurance,Involuntary loss of insurance is a qualifying event for a new plan. Go to Covered CA and you should be able to pick a plan with proof of your lost coverage. Do it ASAP though because there is a deadline (I forget if it is 30 or 60 days)
HealthInsurance,"If you are earning more than 48000 gross income, then CoveredCA will not cover you. You can use their site to gain knowledge about different issuances. But do not sign up with them if you earn more than the minimum income. A BlueShield insurance through CoveredCA gives you LESS access to doctors than the BlueShield insurance  by itself for the same price. CoveredCA has a smaller network of doctors.

Since you just switched jobs, you do not need to be part of the open enrollment period. But you must apply within 2 months of leaving your last job or something.

Once you have an idea of what insurance companies you want (Kaiser, BlueShield, Aetna, etc), visit each website for rates and plans.

I had to figure all this out myself too. Learned some hard lessons."
HealthInsurance,"I thought of a question. Next year when I am filling out my taxes, will I mark that I had health insurance for this entire year or would that be lying? "
HealthInsurance,"As long as you're paid up to the end of the month at least, then the claims will be paid based on when the procedure was performed."
HealthInsurance,"It's somewhat a mystery to me as well.  But I think the question was more about the primary, commercial employer coverage.  That should behave how any other plan would operate, regardless of what happens after."
HealthInsurance,"You'll have only a 2 month gap, which is ok by the feds. I believe they start their ""lack of coverage"" penalty meter at 3 straight months of no coverage (hoping for experts here to correct me if necessary)"
HealthInsurance," if it's happening in your company, that's a problem. You seem like a decent guy. Which means that if you didn't realize what you were doing was wrong, then a bunch of other people didn't realize what the law actually was. And that speaks to a failure of corporate and compliance management. Ultimately the people who get punished are the people who are not appropriately trained. Not the one who have the duty to train them."
HealthInsurance,"This is technically correct.  The IRS “can” waive the fee for 2 months of no coverage. It depends on case by case basis.   IRS.gov has a calculator to check it out.

I have seen people with 1 month of no coverage get hit with a penalty. Depends on household, income, if you could have gotten coverage or exemptions, etc.  typically tho for the average joe or Jane, yes two months is the limit for not having coverage .  



"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"It’s based on whether you’re claimed as a dependent on your parents taxes or are filing taxes yourself. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I have seen people with 1 month of no coverage get hit with a penalty. Depends on household, income, if you could have gotten coverage or exemptions

I've never heard of this. Can you elaborate or maybe provide an example?"
HealthInsurance,"I can try to elaborate a bit.  I have worked in “Obamacare” since it came out.   I have seen all sorts of random things throughout the years. One of them being the fee and it’s calculations.

The IRS provides a calculator that states what the fee should be, healthcare.gov has similar guidelines as well. 

I have seen a handful of cases where the applicant misses 1-2 months of coverage during the year and get hit with a partial penalty.   

In one case, the applicant had missed 1 month during the year, and got hit with a partial fee. It wasn’t much but they still got dinged. They had their tax person work with accountant.  

On the other hand, I have seen applicants go without coverage for 2 months and never got hit with fee. Everything was fine. 


The only thing I have seen be constant, is if you miss more then 2 months. They will hit you with that fee, unless you can file for some sort of exemption and be approved for it. 

My guess is that there was something in those handful of cases that didn’t meet whatever rules they have setup to determine who gets what fee and how much. It’s not a common thing as far as I can see. But I have seen it happen more than once.

If you have any questions you can message me. 

"
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I also used an online calculator to see if I could qualify for health insurance marketplace (i.e., Obamacare), but it indicated that I would not be eligible (because I make too much money per month AND because my employer does indeed offer health insurance). 

I'm afraid I can't point you to insurance coverage that would be of any use to you right now, but I may be able to clarify something for you that could come in handy when you evaluate the coverage your employer offers.


YOu probably *were*  eligible to enroll in ACA marketplace coverage during the annual enrollment window, with no pre-existing condition limits, etc, but based on your income, you MAY not have been eligible for premium tax credits that would reduce the price you pay for coverage. 


The annual enrollment window is closed now, so the difference is moot for you.


Being eligible for employer-sponsored coverage does not make you ineligible to opt for ACA coverage instead - but it CAN make you ineligible for premium tax credits for marketplace coverage. 


For many people, there's little distinction here; for SOME, the distinction can be helpful, particularly for people who find themselves at an employer that has an older workforce, or that charges a bunch for dependent coverage, or whose coverage doesn't cover what a person needs covered.


What about helping you with affordable care? Maybe find a local community health center. They might provide you some guidance as far as local resources (all health coverage, and most health care, is ""local""). [Find a local community health center here](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/)."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;How do they get away with this?

Sorry to hear about your situation. No defending the systemic lack of clear communication to you about the process- either by your clinicians or by the insurer (I reflexively blame the latter most). 

Not to defend either MDs or insurers, but medications for issues like yours are notoriously difficult to prescribe; effective dosages &amp; combinations are much more art than science, and there are torrents of data on Rx efficacy that, at present, probably does more to confuse care management than it does to improve it. At best, it could be conceded that the dangers of over - or mis-medication are probably as bad as under-medication - but that's no kind of comfort in your circumstances.

Again, sorry about your situation."
HealthInsurance,"From what I recall on that question, it’s literally the only time it shows up for ether side, marketplace or insurance company.  Whatever way you answer that question, “have you used tobacco products in the past 60-90 days?”  locks you in for that answer for the year.  There is nothing you can do to change it.

It sucks but that’s is how they have it set up. Say for example you signed up for insurance and were a smoker at that time, you would have answered yes. That gets locked in the application and system for both sides.  
Now fast forward 6 months, and you decided to quit. Awesomeness! Great job!  But the insurance company and marketplace won’t let you change it.
It won’t matter who you talk to, supervisor, their boss, the bosses boss. It just cannot be changed. 
( I speak from experience with marketplace applications and all the ins/outs.)


Now on to what and how this will affect your coverage if you have a tobacco related issue with your health.  I suggest calling the insurance company you’re with and express your question about that with them.  Anyone could speculate yes or no, but honestly they have your policy, what it covers and what it doesn’t. 

For future reference: if you do get a life change or gain a special enrollment period with the marketplace that allows you to change details, that will re-ask that question to update it. Re-enrollment for next year works as well.
Usually the average person doesn’t change anything during the year.  "
HealthInsurance,"thank you, just one more question to ask. I'm a permanent resident and in the application they're asking for immigration document ID. Is this the alien ID number on the green card? "
HealthInsurance,"Here's the big question. Could I get a temporary (short term) health policy to have just in case- while still having ACA coverage? I understand that double indemnity cannot happen and that's not what I want...But if I got another policy that reflected tobacco use. Again, I am not sick or have anything diagnosed, but after quitting tobacco, I all the sudden give a shit about my health. Since I'll be tobacco free by open enrollment, I more than sure all will be well by then and life can go back to normal. I just hate uncertainty and 75/month is worth that kind of peace of mind. "
HealthInsurance,"It should be, but I’m not positive- /u/daneslord do you? (I just jumped in earlier because they hadn’t answered yet)."
HealthInsurance,I'm curious when you say that 95% of US jobs exclude these types of procedures.....are you quite sure?  That isn't often the case...
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I couldn't speak on how doctors and hospitals are compensated since I've never gotten into that with the carriers, but I would imagine not since these plans also have the same benefits as their PPO counterparts. The difference is in premium--*they are anywhere from 4 - 8% cheaper than the PPO counterpart. *

Again, thanks for this. Feels like a big premium gap to be accounted for if benefit design and networks are identical. What thing other than a compensation difference would account for it, other than some level of HMO-like practice controls on the EPO?
"
HealthInsurance,"From what I’ve been told by my reps, they just take out the out of network benefit. Apparently carriers have been getting bent over by out of network claims so by not covering it they are saving enough to drop the premium a significant amount. 

It’s open access so no PCP appointment, referrals, or any gatekeeping exist. The only similarity it has to an HMO is the lack of out of network coverage. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt;  they just take out the out of network benefit

that might account for it, but you said the benefits were identical...?"
HealthInsurance,"I said the network and the in-network benefits are identical. "
HealthInsurance,"ok, missed that. Even worse, before your previous post, I had somehow persuaded myself you were comparing an EPO and an HMO, which of course you weren't . 

I should probably steer clear of posting in any subs more challenging than r/mildlyinteresting after about 9:30pm....."
HealthInsurance,"Yeah it happens. Anyway, we’re selling a lot of them, that combined with level funding has been a big money saver. "
HealthInsurance,"Are you offered coverage through your employer?  Can you post a summary of what it costs and covers?  "
HealthInsurance,What expenses did she use it for that was non-qualified?
HealthInsurance,"The temp agency doesn't offer anything that we can use. The have 3 plans that cover minimum ACA requirements. And 1 bronze plan. The bronze plan has a $14000 deductable. "
HealthInsurance,"What's the monthly premium for yourself and then for your family?  I ask, because if your employer offers coverage that meets certain requirements then you don't qualify for a subsidy through the marketplace."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;My mother contributed about $6,000 into an HSA account last year

were you covered under her plan as well? the individual HSA contribution limit was under $4k for 2017. Maybe the ""tariff"" as you call it was simply that she contributed more than would be tax-favored, &amp; she's seeing the excise tax on excess contributions.

Maybe she can sue whomever mis-managed her HSA contributions, though they'll no doubt hide behind the reality that tax liability is on the plan participant"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I get there are Tax credits with the ACA, but that seems too good to be true....What's the catch?

what do you mean? They are what they are. But where are you that a Silver level plan premium is $1,200 for mid-20s you &amp; 1 dependent? That sounds real high

EDIT: whoops, missed the ""Alabama"" part. I'll be back with more thoughts

EDIT EDIT: ok, I put you in Birmingham, &amp; I'm seeing your tax credits reducing your premiums by a little less than half - but WITHOUT tax credits, silver premiums are in the $400-500 range. Gold plan premiums, unsubsidized, are under $1,000. Where are you seeing $1,200/month premiums? Tell us more

EDIT EDIT EDIT: I shouldn't do this before coffee #2; can't count to 3. However, still seeing just 1 plan - Gold - with unsubsidized premium over $1k/month. Everything else is less"
HealthInsurance,"Yep, this. If your employer offers ACA compliant plans, you won't be eligible for any subsidies through the exchange, unless the cost to insure yourself (and ONLY yourself) is greater than about 9% of your pay."
HealthInsurance,"Open enrollment has closed, but you may qualify for a special enrollment period if you have had any of the following [events](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/).

Additionally, Georgia did not expand Medicaid, so that whole thing is a dumpster fire.

If you aren't eligible for a special enrollment, your best course of action is probably to contact a local dr. Often, they will give you a discount if you pay them in cash up front. If you need further testing, you can call around to the facilities that do it, and ask for an upfront cash discount.
"
HealthInsurance,"I don't qualify for any special cases, honestly it just slipped my mind to get coverage during enrollment. 

I'll look up doctors, thank you!"
HealthInsurance,"Open enrollment is over - You can only enroll if you have a qualifying event - Like you recently moved, lost coverage, getting married, etc."
HealthInsurance,I moved from Tennessee to Georgia last July. Probably too late to for that to count though.

HealthInsurance,"EnvisionRx is a prescription drug benefits manager, owned by RiteAid. They're not your pharmacy - they're the entity your dad's employer hired to manage its prescription drug benefits. 

Walgreenss may - or may not - process scripts for EnvisionRx members, at favorable rates, or at ANY rates. (Walgreens was going to buy RiteAid, but dump EnvisionRx. In the end, the whole deal was scrapped).

So whip out your EnvisionRx card and tell your pharmacy tech that's your Rx payer. If they make a face, maybe they don't process EnvisionRx claims. "
HealthInsurance,"&gt; I was hoping for a ~100k deductible, similar to life insurance type plan

HealthInsurance,"Kaiser's the gold standard anymore for open-access health benefits info, &amp; has been for years.

Are you inquiring about this for ""commercial"" purposes? Because things are going to get quite interesting with respect to coverage of monitoring services in the very near future (see emerging federal law around coverage of monitoring/telehealth services in Medicare/caid)"
HealthInsurance,"Envision does have a mail order business, so it’s possible that dad’s benefits do require him to fill through them. Other than that, spot on."
HealthInsurance,"Exactly what this guy said. It's a prescription benefits manager. They process your pharmacy bills. So the pharmacy should be sending the bill to EnvisionRx instead of to you, (you may still be responsible for a copay or deductible). 

I'm not familiar with EnvisionRx, but I looked on their website and punched in my zip code. They'll work with any pharmacy in my zipcode, but they had CVS marked as a preferred partner. So I'd try calling your nearest CVS or other local pharmacies and ask them if they take EnvisionRx. If they do, then have your prescriptions sent there and use your card next time."
HealthInsurance,nice get
HealthInsurance,"If you're a smaller company speak to your benefits department to see if at your next anniversary they will offer a second option that is a mimic plan but is HSA qualified (the current plan may not be) and start an HSA service as well that they can contribute less than the FSA amount to. That's a win-win for the employer. "
HealthInsurance,"What I meant by that is I was hoping if, in this world where you can get a $100,000 life insurance policy for say, $20 per month, then also someone may sell a ridiculous “odds stacked against the consumer” health insurance policy that one has a very small chance of ever filing a claim against, but also has a low premium, and qualifys for one to put money into an HSA.

I don’t see why I can’t put money into an HSA tax free, if I even had no health insurance policy at all. "
HealthInsurance,"well, for a lot of reasons connected with living in a complex 21st century society, but among the practical reasons is your puny HSA will not do squat for you if you pop a brain blood vessel &amp; require 100k worth of rescue surgery"
HealthInsurance,"can you remove info related to your name, address, other stuff that could identify you, &amp; post an image of the EOB? that way someone might interpret"
HealthInsurance,"Commercial related questions, yeah. I've been thinking about what some consider the holy grail of cancer testing where they can detect markers in your blood. The tests would save insurance companies a lot (since they'd catch cancers early), but you'd probably get them a lot more frequently (thus the ""monitoring"" which I probably should have called something like regular screening.)"
HealthInsurance,"I can add that Walgreens locations randomly have problems entering the Envision insurance into their system. If you have Envision and Walgreens says they can't find your coverage, make them call it in to verify."

HealthInsurance,"I'm not involved in any business where this could be used. It's more that I'm interested in what future healthcare might be like and how fast govt/insurers will respond to changes in technology.

To apply another cliche, from the IT world, it's useful to ""waste what's cheap""; ""wasting"" monitoring tech means, as an innovator, that you can try (&amp; discard ineffective applications of) monitoring tech more ""safely"" than you can try alternative applications of, say, doses of Sovaldi."

HealthInsurance,"&gt; Sounds like the gov is leveraging people to buy an item from a private company

no. Insurers ""own"" the regulation of health insurance, as they own the regulation of ALL insurance, at the state level. look up the term ""regulatory capture"".

I’m not going to say I know who the lobbists are or what agency is responsible, but when a person has to pay $1000s per day to stay in a hospital, and there are no cheap alternatives (I’m assuming because said agency won’t let places like that open their doors, perscribe drugs), something is wrong."

Different from BCBS? depending on where she is (""all health coverage is local""), probably not.

Medicaid is state-run, mostly federally funded, &amp; your mileage depends on what state you're in. 

A lot will depend on who her clinicians are now &amp; their acceptance of Medicaid patients. She/you should make discreet inquiries.....

I'm kind of surprised mom is paying ""only"" $650/month for coverage that sounds pretty generous. That figure will mount rapidly during the next decade; you are right to be concerned that health coverage may well be a budget buster for her.

HealthInsurance,"If you go onto CalOptima’s website you can click on “Commonly Asked Questions”. See #8. So the insurance you have through your employer is primary and CalOptima is secondary. What that means is that you have to submit your claims (basically use) Cigna first (I.e. your employers plan) then if you have any copays, deductibles, or coinsurance from that plan, you can submit to CalOptima for additional payments. Ultimately, what’s left is what you’ll owe to your doctor. My suggestion is to call CalOptima and Cigna and talk to live people... let them know what your situation is and have them explain the process to you from their perspective.  "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks, it's OON for but whatever reason, the coinsurance was taken out of my in-network out-of-pocket maximum. I've submitted an appeal to resubmit the claim to hopefully see a higher Amount Allowed."

I'm going to call them tomorrow to clarify, but wanted to make sure I had all the details right. The above makes it sound like they won't cover injuries. However, that seems odd that the university would have an exception in their own student health insurance policy built in for IM sports that the university organizes. Not sure if that's the norm or not. Thoughts?

**EDIT**

Regarding your edit, the lady told me that Intercolleigate sports were not covered so my injured would not be covered. I explained to her that these were not intercollegiate sports, but rather **intra**collegiate and she said she'd never heard that word before. It made it sound like she was just uninformed, which is why I looked at the plan again. 

Aetna is aware of the cause as I spoke to them today because they wanted an accident report. "
HealthInsurance,"I would call. Provided your plan didn't change, Aetna should be covering it. Even if you have to appeal, you already have the supporting documentation. 

Also, it's possible that they are questioning the cause of the accident. 

Are you registered for Navigator? If the claim processed, is it saying it's flat out a plan exclusion or is it pending for accident details?"
HealthInsurance,"If Aetna still will not reconsider the claim, in addition to appealing the claim, you should contact your Dean of Students or someone in health administration within Student Life about your concern."
HealthInsurance,"To answer 2) yes, if you have health insurance through your employer, and add a child, someone will have to pay for it, either you, your employer, or a mix of both."
HealthInsurance,"It sounds like they aren’t in network and if they aren’t, you really really don’t want to use them. "

HealthInsurance,"hey @daneslord, I just found out I don't qualify for Medi-Cal and the cheapest plan through Covered California is $172/month. are there any other cheaper alternatives? "
HealthInsurance,"hey @taa5950, i just found out i don't qualify for Medi-Cal and that the cheapest insurance option through Covered California is $172/month. are there any cheaper insurance alternatives?
"
HealthInsurance,"i wouldnt assume the hospital isnt in net.  You should definitely verify, and make sure they have submitted a request for, and received a prior authorization.  (You should have also received a letter that your surgery was approved).  BUT....  if you have a deductible (and I am assuming you do, and its not a little number) its pretty normal for the hospital to want partial payment up front.  But I am sure your deductible is less than 8k.  So I am guessing the hospital either doesnt have an auth on file, or is somehow miscalculating your benefits.

Can you first call your insurance and ask if they have an approval on file for this surgery?"
HealthInsurance,How did you search for plans? I went to their shop and compare and just put in $25k/year (about $2k/mo) and age 27 and saw plans around $80/mo. If you make just over $1387/mo you should be seeing much cheaper plans.
HealthInsurance,$172 is a steal. I wish I could pay that little for insurance.
HealthInsurance,"They are in network and I am talking with my doctor and insurance tomorrow to see what they say. Thank you for advice, it’s been a hell of a day."
HealthInsurance,They are in network and I believe it’s been approved by my insurance. I am talking to my doctor later today and then going to call my insurance back. My deductible is FAR less than 8g so that’s why I’m confused. Than you for your response!
HealthInsurance,How ol d are you and what county do you live in?
HealthInsurance,"Hopefully useless info by the time you read this: Have you confirmed that the person asking you for $, has this info?  If there are problems (s/he isn't able to see your info correctly), have you talked to their supervisor?  Either the surgeons office has decided to unilaterally decontract with your insurance, or that person doesn't have your info., or something about your coverage at the first of the year, isnt feeding through.  Do you have your new card?

Also contact your insurance and get a benefit quote, what's your deductible,  how much of it have you met, is your policy paid up to date, and what's your insurance coverage for surgery.  Having this stuff recorded will be important if you have any sort of appeal."
HealthInsurance,"No brainer to contribute to get the match.  That's just free money.  HSA account balances carry over indefinitely and is yours to keep even when you leave the company/plan.

If you can afford it, I recommend contributing enough to cover the annual deductible.  Again, it's yours to keep forever.  If you don't use it, the balance carries over and the following year you can just sit on it and just keep contributing the minimum to get the match."
HealthInsurance,"How much are your deductible and out of pocket? Regardless of those amounts, withhold the amount that will get you the full match if you can afford it. Beyond that, if you really can afford it, max it out. If you’re stretched with other bills, do what you can to make the match work in your budget.

The goal behind a HSA is to have enough in any given benefit period to satisfy your deductible as soon as possible since you pay 100% of those costs. Since those dollars are pretax if you don’t use HSA’s in the event you need to satisfy your deductible, you’re missing out on 25% savings. If you don’t have significant medical expenses, have a two year goal to save enough to satisfy your total out of pocket.

However, also remember that if you need that money, you’ll need to pay a 20% penalty on top of income tax to get it out (if you get audited and discovered).

What bank is administering your HSA? Look into their investment requirements. You’re also allowed to invest HSA dollars into mutual funds beyond a certain balance and as long as you put them back in the HSA at some point and use them for medical expenses, you don’t pay tax on those earnings. It’s a triple tax benefit.

In tax free
Out tax free (for medical expenses)
Invest tax free

When you reach retirement, you’ll be able to withdraw HSA funds if needs without a penalty. So you’ve also been funding a supplemental retirement account.

Let me know if you have more questions."
HealthInsurance,"Definitely do this. Another strategy would be to contribute what you need for the full match and on top of that whatever you anticipated medical expenses would be since they are low - couple of office visits for minor illness, do you take any monthly prescriptions."
HealthInsurance,"You can't be forced to enroll if you don't want.  I'm not in sales, but when acquiring quotes they just want all available data.  Once a plan or plans are chosen, you will have the opportunity to enroll or decline."
HealthInsurance,"Delta Dental. Largest dental insurance company in the US. "
HealthInsurance,"OP, you're not factoring in your eligibility for premium tax credits. Contact Covered California &amp; have a CSR walk you through it. As julepe suggests, you'll pay less than $172/month - probably quite a bit less"
HealthInsurance,"&gt;I've been told to max out but I'm debating on if I could swing contributing that much just with all the other bills I have to pay. 

You haven't provided enough info for anyone to give you any concrete advice. What's your anticipated annual income - what is the total of  your fixed (""non-negotiable"") bill payments? Do you have specific health needs? What kind of health coverage do you currently have (you'll need to be enrolled in a High Deductible Health Plan to open/contribute to a HSA)?
 

This isn't like deciding who your favorite musician ought to be"
HealthInsurance,What is your yearly income?  Because 172 seems wrong if you're close to medi-cal limits
HealthInsurance,"&gt;She called me and said there was no way she could do that, I had to stay on the list

BS - you don't *have* to do anything of the sort. If any sort of similar message gets sent to you, respond by saying you're eager to share their opinion with your state's Insurance Commissioner - that should change their ""off key"" tune.....

&gt;This was in December. We still haven't received any quotes

Your employer has hooked up with a real winner in this outfit. Stay alert &amp; post back here on any future developments"
HealthInsurance,"Most plans define their service areas, which typically stop at a state border's edge. Maybe compare plans offered by the same insurer across the SC/GA border, &amp; look for a plan with similar features. Compare plans using Summaries of Benefits and Coverage [(SBCs) which look like this](https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Forms-Reports-and-Other-Resources/Downloads/SBC-Sample-Completed-MM-508-fixed-4-12-16.pdf). All plans are obliged to provide these ""nutrition labels for health coverage"""
HealthInsurance,Age? Any medical conditions?
HealthInsurance,"I’m 27, and no serious ones. I’m just prescribed Vitamin D"
HealthInsurance,"Core access United health care indemnity plan and suremed to supplement.  Not sure how cheap it is but I know suremed is like 35 to 50 bucks "
HealthInsurance,"Technically, there's no need to resubmit the claim, as there's already one on file and you're not really making any corrections to the coding or patient info.  Resubmitting would likely be denied as duplicate, thus prolonging the situation.

I would submit an adjustment request and include a copy of the primary EOB.  Or you can contact BCBS customer service and request the adjustment, but either way they're going to need to see the EOB showing primary coverage denied the claim before they can complete the adjustment.

"
HealthInsurance,"I'm not sure exactly how Aetna handles it, but most insurance companies have a 'network adequacy' provision that allows for an out of network provider's claim to be covered at the in-network benefit level when there are no in-network providers available within a reasonable distance that can perform the procedure.  It usually is handled much like an authorization and often includes medical necessity review, so the provider you choose to handle the procedure will probably need to be involved.

I'd recommend starting with Aetna's customer service to see exactly what their process entails."
HealthInsurance,"Thank you so much for the responses. I just knew this insurance broker had to be lying..She's apparently coming in this afternoon to ""discuss"" this with me, and knowing the truth and my rights really helps. My husband says it's most likely a money thing (we only have a handful of employees) and that she won't take me off the list because she wants a bigger payout when she signs us all up for expensive plans we never agreed to. I'll keep you posted on what happens. Wish me luck!"
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"Do you still have a copy of the refund request/demand letter? If you do can you see if it outlines any appeal rights for you to dispute the recovery? If they have an appeal process then you would just need to send the primary EOB with the appeal and they should be able to adjust the claim that way. 

HOWEVER, i have a feeling they will say you need to dispute with Cigna before they will reconsider it. "
HealthInsurance,"Update: the broker said that she emailed us information on what the rates would be in December (I was on Christmas break, didn't see this til Jan, and didn't understand it anyway) and acted like if I didn't accept the cost, then I should have declined right away, but I countered and said first: sending an email and explaining the plans are very different, especially if we aren't even sure this is what we are being offered, second: I never chose a plan from either option, i just ignored the email, and three: I never signed off on anything! So she's using my personal information without my consent!? She basically tried to make me feel badly by saying my work has already paid to put me on insurance (yet I'm not currently covered) and she would see what she could do and walked out of my office, slamming the door like a child. Husband said if they force me into anything I just quit at this point. :("
HealthInsurance,Thank you so much for your response. It seems like resubmitting as a secondary claim would be different from the initial claim because I'd be adding the information about Cigna's (non) payment to the claim and marking it as secondary. You're right that denying as duplicate would prolong the whole process. I think we'll just call BCBS to find out how to submit the Cigna EOB to them. Thanks again.
HealthInsurance,"Yes, I do still have a copy. I went ahead and paid BCBS back because prior experience tells me they'll just take their money back from other claims anyway, which messes up my accounting system. 

We'll call BCBS to find out how they want to handle this. It sounds like a secondary claim may not be the best way to go as this is not just a case of the primary insurance under-paying; they fully denied the primary claim. 

Thank you very much for your time and response!"
HealthInsurance,"It's up to the provider, but I've never seen coinsurances being collected upfront before, just copays."
HealthInsurance,"You're welcome :)

you're not wrong about a claim with primary EOB being different than the initial submission, however most insurers automate the data entry of claims and have software that checks for duplicate claims based on CPT/DX coding and patient info.  I've seen many corrected claims denied as a result of this, so I figured I'd recommend the easy way of simply requesting adjustment."
HealthInsurance,"This is a very broad question. Each state has different rules for medicaid. Someone getting approval in NY wouldnt mean a thing to a medicaid plan in PA for example.

I dont know what dexcom is nor am i overly familiar with diabetes meds. If its not on the medicaid formulary though im going to say your chances of getting it approved are probably not good."
HealthInsurance,So does the letter explain how to dispute?
HealthInsurance,"hey @LsdAlicEx9, i'm 27 and I only get subscribed Vitamin D. i'm healthy for my age. any inexpensive health care option you know i can sign up for?"
HealthInsurance,"my yearly income is about $33k w/o taxes. After taxes, it's $24k. i'm 27 and healthy. @Daneslord know of any cheap health insurance options that could give decent coverage? (fingers crossed, i hope that's not a tall order) 
"
HealthInsurance,"i'm 27 with good health, and live in the county of los angeles. @Julepe0, know of any inexpensive health care option you know i can sign up for?"
HealthInsurance,"Continuous glucose monitoring. Pretty new stuff as far as approval for home use. Dexcom G5 and Freestyle Libre are the only two with FDA approval. Here are the coverage criteria for Part B, which would probably be what a state Medicaid or private insurer would use as their starting point for forming their own criteria:

https://www.dexcom.com/medicare-coverage"
HealthInsurance,"I'm in California.  "
HealthInsurance,"Yeah there's some short term options out there  I don't sell in your state but if you just want basic catastrophic  coverage look into short term medical.  Lifeshield plan 2 is good.  But it doesn't stop the penalty it doesn't do free preventative nothing really does besides government  plans or marketplace plans.  You can get a free script  discount card or use goodrx  for the vitamin maybe "
HealthInsurance,"Are you working now? What income did you put down? And what state are you in? I have a hunch but don’t want to tell you the wrong thing. "
HealthInsurance,"Not sure you're running estimates correctly. When I put you in midtown manhattan, I'm finding gold plans that, with premium tax credits,run around $1,400/month - not $2k

&gt;Can/should we buy plans a la carte?


You can, &amp; that may be a budget-saving approach for you. I don't think you can get marketplace coverage costs down to what your wife's contributing for employer-sponsored coverage, but it should DEFINITELY be less costly than COBRA coverage - which by the way will be LOTS more than that $500 monthly you're contributing now...."
HealthInsurance,"Wowza, yes, there should be much better options.  Firstly, your wife isn't going to qualify for subsidies (because the cost to insure just yourself in your employer plan is less than 9.5% of your income - yeah, they don't take into account spouse's cost).  

However, for less than 591, we should be able to get her something that is reasonable.  What is her age, and county.  Also, how healthy is she."
HealthInsurance,"&gt;Medicare is dropping coverage of my wife

MedicAID. Medicare is for people age 65+, and others who qualify due to disability or specific health conditions 

&gt;I was wondering if there are any cheaper options out there for her

Marketplace plans may be less costly depending on your wife's age. You probably won't qualify for premium tax credits, but ""retail"" premium costs may be under that $591/month figure"
HealthInsurance,To piggy back off of what he said; you're probably going to shop around...can we get the county you live in and all three of your ages (as well as the child's gender)
HealthInsurance,"TL:DR  Sorry, can't provide one.  Read the whole darn thing.

Hiya.  The easiest way is to know what we're up against.  What is the county you will be in, the age and sex of everybody in the family, and income.  Because you are self employed, I need the income *after* you write off business expenses, but *before* you write off personal deductions.  

Every insurer is required to cover certain basic [things](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/what-marketplace-plans-cover/).  All carriers are not created equal, **however** an educated person, with a nudge in the right direction, can get what they need.  Insurance is a regulated industry, and so long as you know what the regulations are (that's what this sub is for), you'll be fine.

Re: state lines.  All insurers cover emergency rooms and urgent care nation-wide, (with the exception only of Humana's narrow network products, which only cover ER visits nation-wide).  BTW, Humana narrow network may be the 3rd or 4th layer of hell.  

Regarding Health insurance and cost.  Health insurance exists to prevent an unfortunate event from becoming a financial disaster.  The cost to treat breast cancer w/o insurance can easily hit 100K.  Every health insurance plan (assuming you stay in network) will limit that to a maximum of 6K (that's the extreme, most plans are half that).  

So let us help you find the plan for you.  We don't get any commission for it, we just take your info and plug it into the exchange.  We're professionals, and we're here to help."
HealthInsurance,Yes.
HealthInsurance,"Ok, so we're passed the open enrollment period.  However, you might qualify for a special enrollment period.  [These](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/special-enrollment-period/) are the events that trigger a special enrollment period. "
HealthInsurance,"Hiya.  So you have a couple options, but I have questions.

1.  Did you get insurance from your job or the exchange.

2.  Does your new job offer health insurance.

3.  What is your projected yearly income if you had not taken the new job.

4.  What is your projected yearly income considering both the old and new jobs.

5.  Just by the way, for numbers 3 and 4, I need gross numbers, not net."
HealthInsurance,"Hi.  If you haven't moved permanently, (aka, you are just on a long visit) then you have not changed your residence.  Apple health will pay for urgent care and ER visits (and rx fills) while you are in 'bama (roll tide).  "
HealthInsurance,"My pleasure.  get a list from your insurer of dermatologists in network, and then call and take the soonest doc that is available. "
HealthInsurance,"Hi, after you leave your employer, what do you project your income will be?  Also, is it just you?"
HealthInsurance,"yeah.  My guess is that they're short term and won't cover shit.  "
HealthInsurance,"Thanks! Just waiting to hear back "
HealthInsurance,That’s a much better answer :) Thanks for getting back to me!
HealthInsurance,[removed]
HealthInsurance,"1. Current insurance through exchange
2. No insurance through new job
3. Gross income for retail job $20k
4. Gross income for new job $30-40k (still negotiating)"
HealthInsurance,"28 years old. Bell County. And no health problems. Non smoker/non drinker. "
HealthInsurance,"Yes, you are right, Medicaid. I got them mixed up. "
HealthInsurance,"that's ok, everyone does - but they are different, and when you're sorting out what your options are, a lot rides on the details"
HealthInsurance,[deleted]
HealthInsurance,"Edit.

I completely missed the part where you said that the procedure is a covered benefit. That is highly unusual, and that is what threw me. Listen to the what the other people in the sub are saying"
HealthInsurance,"I like [this](https://go.hc.gov/2E11QwD) plan.  368 a month.  40 to see a Dr, 20 generic drugs.

Cuts 223 off the monthly price.  "
HealthInsurance,"There is no law or regulation that requires a healthcare provider to request authorization on your behalf.

That said, providers that are in-network may be in breech of contract with the insurer if they do not request authorization.  You can check with your insurer.  But if the provider still refuses there isn't a whole lot you can do.

You may be able to request authorization on your own.  You would need to obtain your medical records/notes and submit them to your insurer.  Ask your insurer about how to go about it.

edit to add - no law or regulation at the federal level.  I'm not familiar with CO state regs and it's possible, but unlikely I would think."
HealthInsurance,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16906558/anthem-emergency-room-coverage-denials-inappropriate) reduced by 96%. (I'm a bot)

&gt; Anthem&amp;#039;s new policy mirrors similar recent developments in state Medicaid programs, which increasingly ask enrollees to pay a higher price for emergency room trips that the state determines to be non-urgent.

&gt; &amp;quot;There is real and justified concern about this,&amp;quot; said Renee Hsia, a professor of health policy studies at the University of California San Francisco and practicing emergency physician.

HealthInsurance,I agree all though I'm fairly lost at this process.   We've never death with treatment for BD as a medical necessity. The only time we did so was at the instruction of the employer to cover it.
HealthInsurance,"Yeah, I read that walk of text last might and went to bed, hoping someone else would handle it. Thank you. "
HealthInsurance,"Oh wow - I had no idea!! Thank you!

The only thing that's worrying me is that last year I was diagnosed as having a gene mutation for breast cancer, and they've recommended yearly MRIs for early detection. I've gotten a few calls from the Seattle cancer clinic trying to set up my appointment this year, which I'm due for. I'm guessing I'll have to return to Seattle for any sort of care that isn't emergency related then? "
HealthInsurance,"Yes, that will be a bummer. The other part of it, is that even if you wanted to, I don't think I could put you on Alabama Medicaid. They didn't expand it. The only people who are eligible are pregnant women below the poverty line and very poor children.   "
HealthInsurance,It's fine.  They're just letting the federal government know that you did not have health insurance through them for this last taxable year. As long as you were covered by medi-cal you're good
HealthInsurance,"First, calm down. Your post doesnt really give enough info to give you specific advice. HOWEVER, in general, you should have options. If insurance denied something then you should be able to request a letter explaining why, and should also be able to file an appeal to have her case reviewed again (usually by a different doctor/nurse than who denied it originally)

You need to call the insurance and ask to be guided through their appeal process. You can usually submit it verbally over the phone, in writing, or have the prescribing doctor write it, or any combination of the 3. This is what you should focus on right now.

Nobody here is going to suggest whether she should or should not seek a different treatment as thats basically asking for medical advice and we arent her doctor. "
HealthInsurance,"Thank you for the reply. Firstly I'm not especially uncalm, a little lost would be a better word.

The reason I didn't give much info was because I hate life stories. I'm not sure what information was relevent since I don't really have any experience with this sort of thing at all. If there's any information you'd need to give better advice ask away. I'll give the insurance company a call, ask for a written statement and get some advice about repealing. 

Thank you again! "
HealthInsurance,"Not necessarily needing the info for me to give better advice,  but it will help your chances if someone else reads it.

Name of insurer?

med/treatment names?

was a prior auth denied or did the pharmacy just try to run the claim and it was denied? 

How did the alternative get 'approved' (could have been approved from an appeal already, hard to say)?"
HealthInsurance,"As long as we are in the enrollment periods for her job, she can absolutely enroll in her employer-provided plan.  Additionally, there is nothing keeping your wife from dropping her aca plan. However, what's going to be sticky is for you and your children to upgrade your current plan. You can absolutely continue with the same plan, and you will not have to pay her part of the premiums, but I can't see a way forward towards actually changing the plan."
HealthInsurance,"Even if i stay with the provider? Im payimg 720 a month right now for my wife, daughter and i. Its a 60/40 wich is absurd. I think between 700 and 800 a month that could gey my daughter and i much better coverage."
HealthInsurance,"Hi, so the problem is that you can't just enroll in a plan at any time.  Open enrollment has already passed.  The only way to change a plan is to qualify for a [special enrollment period](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/special-enrollment-period/)

Quite frankly, if it's that important, the easiest thing is to move.  If you live close to a county line, move just over the border.  That will give you a special enrollment period."
