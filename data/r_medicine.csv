medicine,"I remember your story. You sound like a really strong and grounded person. I hope this is your last year of residency. "
medicine,"Starter comment: What is r/meddit’s reaction to this? I can’t quite understand how any of this could happen. It seems like a gigantic systemic failure. According to other articles I read, there are no laws in Georgia that require these types of procedures to be done in a hospital or ASC. Also, the doctor is apparently a board certified dermatologist, not a plastic surgeon or general surgeon. Is it typical for derm to do these kinds of procedures? Do we think she is actually operating in these videos? It sure looks like it. I just can’t even fathom."
medicine,"Also MS4, about to graduate and start internship.

So much this. In my experience, quite literally the one thing that medical students want most is to feel useful and like they are part of the team. I remember being elated the first time a nurse asked me to help roll a patient, like I was actually needed! I guess I can't speak for everyone, but if you notice a student looking kinda lost or unsure of what she needs to be doing, maybe try to get them involved in a task, however small it might be."

medicine,"I get that, but almost all the chiromancer threads I’ve seen play out in the same minimally confrontational way:

- Almost all posters say they don’t recommend it because of the lack of evidence, potential harms, and/or common chiro quackery

- Someone in ED, IM, or Radiology will post their carotid dissection horror story

- A few people specifically point out referring to PT or a DO, and then the issue of access is brought up 

- At least 1 person will post an anecdotal success story with patients or themselves, being sure to mention 30-40 times that they ""know it's just an anecdote but..."".

- A chiro or an apologist might come in and talk about how there definitely *is* an issue with quackery in the profession, but *they* (or the bone wizard they go to if it’s an apologist) are actually evidence based, cautious, and effective. "

medicine,"I'm sure senators have a very thorough physical, particularly at such an advanced age. If I had to guess, there might have been an anomaly with his labs/physical/history, like elevated A1C, elevated bilirubin levels, or changes in stool patterns and consistency, that would cause the physician to look deeper at underlying causes, leading to the pancreatic cancer discovery."
medicine,"Quite a few of those were for all cause mortality, actually.

As an aside:  
One of the things most commonly associated with all cause mortality is actually LBM; which is maybe why people who are slightly overweight often fare better at the end of life than people who have a low-normal or low weight. It's sort of a U-shaped curve in regards to that, but we don't know *exactly* why it is, only based on conjecture. Fat mass and relative amounts of fat mass are also associated with worse mortality outcomes though. Body composition on the whole is often reflective of a number of factors too, so there's obviously confounders.

Nutrition is my jam =D"
medicine,"Seems easy enough to frame that discussion. ""So, based on your vital signs and labs, CMS has decided I'm supposed to do a bunch of stuff as if you have a really bad infection brewing, but you don't. If I do what they want me to, it could cause your heart to fail, make it hard for you to breathe, and possibly require us putting a tube down your throat.""

medicine,"Some salty mofos in here. Anyways. Talking about the financials only. Let’s say you are 32 and you work until 62. Ignoring inflation and trying to predict field trends. Assuming average salary over that entire time. Big assumptions but this is napkin math. 


Staying PA

104k per yr avg x 30 yrs = 3.12M lifetime. 


Doctor (assuming 4y school 3y residency aka minimum)

202k per yr avg x 23 yrs = 4.67M lifetime as attending

52k per yr avg x 3 yrs = 156k

-208k public med school avg

Total = 4.62M

Your loan interest will wear down the total. 

Data from quick google searches. The specifics aren’t important but you get the idea. In my mind what is more important is whether you want to access your earning potential in your 30s. I’m planning on having kids soon so the idea of delaying full salary until 39yo is terrifying. "
medicine,"Alternatively, I know a PA that also became a lawyer.  He does both jobs. "
medicine,"I certainly agree.  Dermatologists are essential.  The reality is looks matter, and dermatologists certainly improve quality of life significantly.  My point is, they are arguably less essential than a good family medicine physician, given that many of their acute, life saving functions can be managed by other specialties.  What is the added value of a dermatologist seeing and evaluating a patient for a skin lesion over a PCP?  I don't know.  But worst comes to worst, getting a biopsy and then treating a cancer is a process that doesn't need derm to function, is my point.  The rheum/derm stuff can sometimes be handled by rheumatology solo, though they defer to derm sometimes for the primary skin disorders.

This is not to say that Dermatologists aren't valuable or essential.  But given a choice, we should fund more PCPs, and less Derms."

medicine,"Your initial aggressively sarcastic comment in a thread about caring competent professionals who are being discriminated against suggests that you do care. Or maybe you're just an a-hole. 

And you still haven't said anything to substantiate how exactly you think psychiatric history is relevant to fitness to practice."
medicine,"That’s what the first few paragraphs of the article were about, but then it got into uses for A.I. beyond discharge such as psychotherapy. (Granted the article portrayed A.I. psychotherapy in a negative light, but more because of the belief that psychotherapy requires the potential for embarrassment.) The article also gave numerous examples of people being more willing to be honest with an A.I. in other settings, and then described the problem of patients being too embarrassed to admit that they failed to comply with the recommended medication and/or lifestyle changes. Providing additional information in a nonjudgmental format would not undo the noncompliance; the article seemed to suggest that the patients might be more willing to confess to an A.I. than their doctor that they didn’t exercise because they felt they were too busy. "
medicine,"Let's tack on how absurd it is that a ROS is *required* to bill a high-level visit. I can diagnose you with brain cancer, give you comprehensive counseling, review imaging, etc. and bill level 2 because I forgot a ROS. So stupid."
medicine,"Had a cash pay patient recently choose to come to us as a cash pay patient for cataract surgery. Why, I’m not entirely sure, since they live in a country with nationalized healthcare. Nevertheless, working with the facility to determine an estimate of the bill for them was ridiculous. You are completely right that it’s becoming difficult to figure out how much one would even need to charge a cash pay patient."
medicine,"&gt;  always so toxic

I call people out on their bullshit, I also give credit where credit is due. Which is why I support Youtubers like ZdoggMD and Dr Hope who both try an lift other Medical Youtubers up, while Dr Mike is only interested in serving himself. 
"
medicine,"Agreed. 

Every time I see this I keep thinking 'did they not realise that the parents went to the eu court with this?' 

If they actually had a case then maybe it would have been a case of parental vs state autonomy. 

At the time of Alfie's death the father apparently gave mouth to mouth and attempted 'resus'. This is the mind of a man clearly in severe denial. I'm not sure any level of reasonable explanation would have changed his mind. "
medicine,"Let's talk cost. Board certification is now divided into 5 pieces that have to be completed over 10 years:

1-Maintenance of Professional Association

I am forced to be an AOA member, even if I don't agree with all their lobbying efforts. Membership dues are $683/year, and the ""Certification Maintenance fee"" = $90.  So total of $773/year x 10 years = $7730

2- Lifelong Learning assessment

I am required to complete at least 120 hours of continuing education every 3 years. I actually complete closer to 80 or so every year.  There are many ways to do this, though I usually go to conferences.  A week-long conference is usually ~40 credits, a single day can be 2-7.  I get a smattering throughout the year.  These credits usually cost about $70/credit for CME.  

Other things count too, like BLS/ALS/ATLS/NRP certifications (all of which I currently have).  When I take the courses to recertify, I can submit these as CME as well.  Some have to be paid out of pocket, some are covered by my job.  Usually runs a couple hundred dollars every other year.

I also have to complete Osteopathic specific Practice Modules. Fortunately, the AOBP graciously provides these for free, but it took me about 3 hours to complete.

3-Demonstration of Cognitive Expertise

This is the Board Examination.  I originally took 5 exams to receive my board certification--Comlex I/II/IIIa/b, Step 1 Boards, and the Specialty Boards.  Each of these exams is AT LEAST $1000, this latest one was $1150. Additionally the COMLEX IIIb is an in-person examination where we take H&amp;P on actor patients, and when I took it was only offered in PA.  So, we not only had to register for the exam, but we needed to fly out to the exam as well, with all the associated costs.  My Specialty Board exam was originally only offered in Chicago, so I originally had to travel for that exam as well--this is no longer the case (thank goodness).

4--Practice Performance Assessment
This is the research bit.  We are required to participate in some kind of research at our institutions, do an exhaustive medical record review + intervention + assess your change in practice, OR do a online course that was supposed to improve your practice.  If you were like me, and changed jobs 4 times in the past 10 years, getting in on institutional research proved to be quite difficult at times.  And medical record reviews were geared towards the primary care provider (which I am not).  If you wanted to do the online courses, they also cost a ridiculous amount of money.  If I remember correctly, it was something like $2000.  There has since been an outcry about this and the AOBP is working on changing it. 

5--Licensure
I have to maintain active state licensure in at least one of the 50 states.  I currently maintain a license in California, Oklahoma and Massachusetts.  Once you get a state license, it is in your best interest to maintain it, because if you let it lapse, you may not be able to get it back ever.  Maintaining each of these licenses is about $200/year/license.  

So, all in all, I've spent probably about $20,000 over the past 10 years to obtain/maintain my board certification, in addition to hours and hours of my life spent studying, trying to participate in some research that is indirectly related to my job, and just the general stress of trying to keep up with all this.  No one at the AOBP helps to make sure that you fulfill all the requirements--it's all on me to make sure that I get through everything.

Case in point--I was not notified that my exam registration was due.  I happen to just check the website to see if registration was coming soon.  Oh, lookie there! Registration closes in *5 days*.  That would have been nice to know.  I called my residency buddies and they had not been notified either.  The exam is only given once per year.  

Edit because apparently I can't math late at night."
medicine,"Wow, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. 

Is there any reason to suspect that they won’t grant your license? In other words, is this just a formality or are there examples of this board regularly denying licenses? 

Additionally, do you have any recourse if they deny you? "
medicine,That’s not based on age
medicine,"We need to fucking strike with this single demand.

Any hospital system needs to be run as a closed democratic republic with only practicing physicians able to run for positions such as CEO, CMO, CFO etc.

The physicians who are elected by their peers have less clinical time and that time is spent running the ship....correctly, and with the patients best interests in mind.

What a novel idea."

medicine,"A major problem is state-to-state variance of paramedic training. Of those things you mentioned, most are covered in my state's required education/skills/scope. Our medic programs are longer and much more science-heavy than the RN programs. Anecdotally, my RN friends are sometimes surprised that we know or do certain facts and procedures. Much of RN training is on-the-job and current paramedic curriculum covers most of the specialist emergency nursing certification knowledge (CEN, etc). 

Furthermore, in a position paper on EMS, ACEP recognizes that paramedics engage in, ""a delegated practice of medicine."" Nurses do not. We may be cheaper, but not less capable, at least newer medic grads in my state. "

medicine,"In the very few cases I've seen the fetus was already dead and the woman either presented with fetal parts in the vagina or her water broke during induction of labor and the baby turned to present footling breech. Decapitation was probably much easier in those cases because the amount of tissue decomp.
 This article makes it sound as though this baby was still alive though because they noted the decelerations but it's really difficult to monitor a fetal heart rate in a 25 gestation fetus let alone one that is footling breech with the heart rate in the vagina and with cord prolapse so who knows. "

medicine,"It's not.  There's no reason, aside from the stigma associated with MAT and the idea of ""replacing on addiction with another,"" that someone shouldn't be on MAT longterm, and I certainly wouldn't say that MAT is something to ""endure.""  Personally I'd rather see someone on longterm MAT (which is incredibly effective compared to all other treatment options), than have someone attempt abstinence and lose them, either before naltrexone induction or a few weeks into opioid abstinence, when they're at a higher risk of OD.  Non-opioid agonists I would recommend if diversion is an issue, otherwise MAT with opioid agonists is likely going to be the most successful option.  "
medicine,"I’ll save you some misdirected anger. Nursing mgmt. doesn’t have a single thing to do with any of your gripes. Those are from the top of the ladder and directives, period. There are 10 levels of mgmt. and committees between any decision and a nurse manager.

medicine,"Starter Comment:

This is a scene from the 1973 horror film “The Exorcist.” In this scene, this patient is undergoing a carotid angiography via. a direct carotid puncture. This scene was filmed New York University Medical Center, and the procedure was performed by actual medical staff!

It is important to note that the first CT scanner prototype was only unveiled to the public in 1972. This video has a unique view of neuroimaging before the advent of the more advanced imaging techniques that we have today.

As a little bonus, here is another scene showing an pneumoencephalography, another historical imaging modality, wherein most of the CSF was drained from around the brain via. lumbar puncture and replaced with air, oxygen, or helium to allow the structure of the brain to show up more clearly on an X\-ray image.

medicine,"It can be difficult to get hospital privileges (the ability to admit patients and work on them) in at least some areas of the US (I'm assuming you are not in the US by your flair and the 's' instead of 'c') if you haven't practiced medicine for a while. When you are fresh out of training, it is assumed that you have a certain amount of clinical competence-- you prove the knowledge part by eventually passing the national boards in your specialty. You then have a certain amount of time to prove your clinical competence by having people review your work.


If you have taken an extended break (more than a year or so) and haven't practiced, the hospital may ask you to prove your competence by submitting a case log, letters of recommendation, or other ""proof."" I have seen a couple of folks have trouble with this: one who tried to un-retire and another who did only outpatient work for a few years who wanted to return to the inpatient arena. Both were told they needed to return to training (!) and do a certain number of cases before they'd be reinstated.

medicine,"Was that a copypasta? It seems like more and more you keep on posting things that suggest an agenda you have and possible financial incentive behind that... 

This whole conversation started because I suggested that it’s better to have a regulated market that allows for big pharma to teach physicians about their drugs rather than the unregulated market from the past or the the interaction between pharma and physicians you seem to be pushing. The system I propose allows for big pharma to spread information about their drug because that means more patients using the drug and thus more revenue. Likewise physicians want this because it means education. And staff wants this cause it could mean free food.

You then took an odd spin on this and completely ignored the original suggestion and started talking about how big pharma advertising their products in this way increases the price of the drugs... you brought up a ridiculous assertion backed by no evidence. And I pointed out how that doesn’t make any sense, and anyone with a basic economics background would understand this. I’m sorry you’ve become so hostile in this exchange... you’ve really been all over the place. I just came to discuss how I think the AMA and all physicians can form a healthy relationship with the pharmaceutical industry and you went on a clearly biased tirade about how much you hate the industry and your obvious biases... if you want to focus on the subject we’ve been discussing that’s fine. But yes if you’re going to just shitpost a copypasta post that makes no sense to what we were originally then I’ll just skip over that nonsense. If you actually want TJ discuss what I presented about the benefits of dialogue between physicians and pharma, the well documented fact that more users of a drug helps to drive down the price or that America’s reliance on generics has driven down prices then welcome to discuss that. But cut it out with this nonsense you keep going off on in ridiculous tangents. Present a focused argument. Not some pages of nonsense that read like a copypasta straight out of some lobbyist for a major anti pharmaceutical think tank or pro natural health lobbyist.

&gt;  Why do you ignore these well documented problems I don't know. 

What problems did I ignore? This whole time I’ve just been sharing facts. I described a basic concept in economics. I mentioned the percent of generics the US uses. I mentioned the lower cost of those generics. I never once defended the pharma industry or current regulations. In fact this whole time I’ve supported broader regulation. Just because I support the continued existence of the industry in a well regulated market doesn’t mean I’m ignoring the current problems in the unregulated market. And it’s insane that you would insinuate such. This is why we get no progress on this issue. We have progressives like me propose a solution that allows for continued existence of a market within a well regulated space and all you care about is revenge of past offenses and complete destruction of the industry. Fuck you’re emotional insecurities. All I care about is effective reform. Not this emotional bull shit you propose."
medicine,"You should always at least touch base with those that consult you with recommendations. I feel that it's difficult to call for each patient unless it's an inpatient consultation cause clinics are ridiculously busy. I think on the inpatient side, it should be a requirement to call but obviously that's not always feasible but at some point it would be good to touch base so you guys aren't in parallel IMO"

medicine,"Yes I think it has great potential as a triage tool. The patient can interact with the Chabot, which will elicit the history, and ML can be used to suggest the most likely diagnosis. I think a few companies are trying to do this already e.g. Ada and Babylon health in the UK. However I think for this to truly work and be implemented as a certified triage tool, some point-of-care tests would need to be paired with the Chabot to get get a more accurate likely diagnosis. I think this could alleviate a significant portion of the workload in primary care and non-emergent cases in A&amp;E. "
medicine,"Hopefully you can find the time to read this, again, call out my bullshit.

The first study is of relevance because he OSP-A that is tied to the TLR-2 agonist response which is connected to the TLR-9 disruption. It has been found in many case reports that there has been a correlation with reactivating herpes, ebv, and many other viruses related with the pathway. 

Basically I have a hypothesis that people with chronic Lyme aren’t effected by lyme itself but the re activated latent viruses that every one of us holds. Which is why antibiotics don’t seem to help in late stages.

You’ve made me realize that I shouldn’t tout a hypothesis as fact at first glance (duh), and I thank you for that. I’m going to make a list of the knows and don’t knows to really boil this down.

I completely understand why you’re skeptical, I am too extremely skeptical in other ways. I’m definitely bias because of my own experience with Lyme disease and Babesia (Malaria like infection). I’ve gotten both twice. And let me tell you it takes a lot for a doctor to prescribe you medication for this disease, even when your legs swell enough to cause stretch marks, you can barely walk up or down stairs or sit down without crying in agony. Liver enzymes elevated many times their normal limits, and losing 30 pounds in the span of 3 weeks. Not even then. I had to almost pull the arm off my doctor to prescribe me amoxicillin. And when she did, (for an unrelated condition) I was better in 2 days, able to eat normally with no swelling in my legs and liver function instantaneously returning to normal. I was 2 days from being thrown into a fibromyalgia specialists arms to be forever put in a loop of anti inflammatory medication, honestly with my inability to eat or drink, I may have died. 

The second time was not as bad but mostly annoyance. Same scenario except the inflammation was in my spine, lost 30 pounds in 4 weeks even when I was eating, I would just diarrhea it out, 4 weeks straight. I would have sweats that would last all night and extremely high bilirubin tests which indicated a high red blood cell conversion rate. I asked my doctor to help again just to be declined as well. I gave up on him and did shit myself and now after 1 and a half years of absolute shit at 21 years old I’m finally 95% better because of the treatments I’ve made myself through research and true knowledge.

Boo hoo though, honestly there’s many who are worse than I. I was a lacrosse, soccer, cross country and wrestler when I was 17 in which all progress was stripped. After my first bout with Lyme I started bodybuilding, and building jet engines, I was able to deadlift 415 at me peak and squat 325. I got lyme for the second time and that was stripped from me in a month again.

After having to quit my job of building jet engines for 2 and a half years I still miraculously was able to make over $110,000 last year, and continue my engineering schooling as well as getting ready to switch to Biomedical Research. All at 21.

I’ve experienced it and am still currently beating the fuck out of Lyme. And have helped many around me get back on their feet. Some people off themselves before they even get the chance because of the physical and emotional agony this disease puts them in, where family friend and people meant to help the common populace turn their backs and call them crazy all because they don’t have an answer.

Yeah I’m bias. And I am always down to argue over and over be proved wrong over and over to seek the truth. But calling good people that have helped many quacks? 

I’ve had people I know blow their heads off, choke themselves to death and murder their dog with them because they got no help. But damn them right?

This disease is highly treatable right?

In my eyes through my experience I find that objectively wrong.

You made me realize all of this stuff I pull out isn’t good evidence for a conclusion. But it will be a pretty good hypothesis to test.

Obviously this disease destroys many lives. I’m saying there are many red flags around the purpose of this vaccine. When the people who made it keep changing their opinions over and over to suit their situation.

The man I like to quote a lot is Dr.Derrick Lonsdale. The man was called a quack by many of his colleagues for years. All while they talk shit he seems to have opened the door for the most meaningful research in Autism and many other diseases tied back to the biochemical imbalances of the autonomic nervous system and mitochondrial dysfunction. Now through his works, many of his colleagues that called him crazy are now calling him 30-40 years later telling him he was far ahead of his time. Figure.

Would you also like to know that SIDS is actually a thiamin deficiency? If people would accept their arrogance maybe we could stop that, all because of one simple deficiency. I can go into that all day too, and that’s something I KNOW I can prove to anyone. Lyme is a much harder one . 

And I whole fully appreciate the negative feedback because using that feedback puts me back to my place and signifies what more I need. Then maybe I can find something better.

I don’t blame you if you skipped through my sob story. Haha.

Just please be careful who you label a quack just because it makes you feel good that you’re in accordance with the rest of your community and colleagues.

And I understand I have much to learn. And the more I learn the more there will be to learn.

And there’s also one thing I’ll never do is call someone names to engorge my frivolous mental foundry of endorphins and dopamine relating to my feelings of superiority. Because many many years down the line you’re Maybe you are the one who wish he was thinking differently, wishing he was the one who could have saved his loved ones from blowing their own heads off. Wishing he who was so arrogant could have kept his newborn from dying in his cradle over something that was seemingly so arbitrary to him and many. Only if he thought differently during the time.

Yes I’m bias. And yes I’m wrong, a lot, and I’m not afraid to be wrong, which many seemingly are afraid. And I’m not afraid to be called a quack, I’d rather expend myself against the will of social norm and my colleagues rather than watch fiends and family proceed to die in front of my face. 

So be careful who you call a quack.

Many things in medicine were quackery before being proved truthful. (Many also stayed quackery)

So base them on their intention and lives saved rather than preconceptions.

Also I do want to add, I try to look at studies and detect their flaws. I do not agree with the lymerix methodology of their testing for seropositive lyme. They used the Dattwyler (which is a largely less sensitive assay) rather than the western blot, to detect the presence of Lyme. They apparently could not read their western blots. I don’t like that they didn’t use modern testing techniques even if the western blot isn’t the best now it would have been better back then. There are some reports stating that the dattwyler test only picked up 15 percent of cases. And of those 15 percent they were people that presented with the allergic response to the bacteria, i.e. arthritis. The other 85% go on and manifest cardiac and neurological manifestations. So I don’t agree with that methodology.

medicine,"Junior doctor and medical student are non-comparable terms in Australia vs North America - they mean different things.

I've also seen some seasoned doctors separate their personal contempt for patients pretty well, in fact I think it's totally necessary because the vast majority of doctors in their later years I've noticed literally have to do this, and a failure to do so is what makes for a poor doctor - not the feelings themselves. One of the first things I was taught in psychiatry was not to fight counter-transferrence but instead accept that it's a thing, acknowledge I'm experiencing it, and try to attempt to control it with that knowledge. 

You're also generalizing his generalization of a specific breed of psych patient to ALL psych patients, which I don't see here at all. I think he was also more broadly painting the patient encounter so as to pose a general sense you get with this stereotype of patient in emergency medicine - which you get a better sense of the more clinical experience you have.

I think that agenda you're pushing is a spectacularly odd one, because in the healthcare field it's medical students that tend to have the most humility and the least amount of cynicism in the room. Those are the things that seem to go missing with practice. I would always push for humility to remain, I'm not so certain 'empathy' is a particularly good trait for a doctor as so much as being able to appear sympathetic is.

If doctors were all empathetic then they'd be breaking down every other shift."

But Alfie had no autonomy, and never had the opportunity to express his wishes.

medicine,"Being able to pass the information to the patient, no matter how uneducated he is. Also be able to know when he did not understand what you are saying.

You can know everything but if you cannot make your patient understand what he has to do to not die you failed as a doctor."
medicine,"I completely agree and spend a lot of time thinking about this very problem. I do find that a decent chunk of patients are pretty disarmed by, and open to, a thoughtfully-delivered ""I don't know and we may not be there yet with the science"" message. As long as I'm assuring them that their discomfort is real, their concerns are valid, and making some effort to help a part of the situation (I use the phrase ""I can't promise this will help, but I really do want you to feel better"" a LOT), the majority of my patients leave with the ability to tolerate some ambiguity about their symptoms.

I also find that many people do not realize that how symptoms evolve over time and re-evaluation are part of the diagnostic process. So you get that person who has seen dozens of physicians for their symptoms but has not returned for a recheck with any of them. They think that if a rock-solid diagnosis and cure didn't get nailed immediately that they're being dismissed. I try to take the time to explain that the passage of time is actually an important test that can give us information, and that if they're not getting better I absolutely want to hear about it.

But yeah, some folks just want a fancy name for their pain. ""I have a cold"" isn't as sexy as ""I was diagnosed with RSV"" or ""I tested positive for influenza."" If you keep asking, eventually someone will give you a BS name for your itchy teeth or your extra-scaly heel callouses. This is why I cringe every time I read another narrative about ""if your lazy doctor doesn't give you an answer, you have to be an advocate and keep finding SOMEONE who will listen!!!"" Sometimes that is awesome advice. Most of the time, though, it will just give you ""adrenal fatigue"" and a nice long course of thrice-weekly therapies that cost a chunk of change."

Neuro wasn’t great at social interaction and px was a little confrontational.  As soon as he walked into the physicians office he declared munchausen by proxy, in front of everyone.

medicine,"Insurance reimbursement is often so low that it's simply not worth accepting it. There are more than enough patients in most cities to fill a practice with self\-pay, plus dealing with insurance is, as this entire thread shows, an exercise in misery and frustration. Why would you take less money to do more work, and work that is non\-medical, at that?

The answer is primarily a sense of obligation not to impose financial hardship on patients, but that noble impulse only goes so far.

For comparison, locally Medicaid \(or rather, it's privatized behavioral health carveout\) reimburses $105 for a 1\-hour new patient intake, and private insurances are usually similar.. Standard self\-pay rates are usually well upwards of $300. It's no wonder that no one wants to deal with that. It's not just making a living, it's the psychological barrier of accepting less than what we know we're worth on the open market."
medicine,"That's because it's not a diagnosis as far as I'm concerned. It's a set of physiologic responses TO a diagnosis. When I get a septic patient I  care more about diagnosing the perforated viscus. The fact that I have to write down ""sepsis"" so the hospital gets paid more when I have already diagnosed ""perforated colon with fecal peritonitis"", booked him for an emergency case, started resuscitating him, and treating his peritonitis with antibiotics is asinine. It's even better when the ""sepsis alert"" pops up when I'm writing the post-op orders. 

""This patient might be septic?"" Really? The gallon of shit I scooped out of his abdomen must have distracted me from ordering the (useless) repeat lactate.

Over the last 6 months the EGS service has gotten at least 4 consults and 2 intrahospital transfers that were being treated for ""sepsis"" for over 24 hours with no real attempt at determining the source other than the mandated blood cultures which were of no great help in diagnosing the diverticulitis, perfed ulcer, and necrotizing soft tissue infections. 

AFAIC if you're going to mandate blood cultures you might want to mandate a physical exam and routine total body imaging."

medicine,"If you can remember this I commend you. Though I would also add post arrest or cardioversion as both of these may cause bizarre ST segment elevations, and hypercalcemia. At least from an emergency perspective, a better approach is looking at enough ECGs to distinguish between ST segment elevation patterns that represent ischemia and those that don’t and correlating with what the patient looks like. We never are interpreting ECGs in a vacuum. Reciprocal changes = occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI) until proven otherwise. SCAD and myocarditis will both cause this but even experts cannot distinguish between these and OMI. Pulmonary embolism, hyperkalemia and sodium channel blockade (TCA/flecanaide OD usually) will really be the mimics that can screw you. "

It's incredibly difficult working with inner-city/homeless populations in a hospital. There are a ton of rules and expectations that frankly, if someone was able to follow, they probably wouldn't be homeless. If someone refused housing that was set up for them, they may not have been part of the decision making process in setting it up in the first place. 

Lots of times we tell people what they need, rather than asking them what they need, and then are disappointed when they don't follow through. It's a huge cause of burnout, at least in social work. Watching people make poor decisions can be really hard, but pushing someone to make a decision they don't want to make and watching your plan fail over and over is, in my experience, harder in the long run."

Anytime people point out a lack of efficacy or possible harms from treatments, even if the findings are rock solid, there are staunch detractors that will be rejecting everything, yelling about quackery, and being accusatory. 

Antidepressants might be a good example of ""debate"" that you're referring to. Still, there are many that claim they're basically miracle drugs. I think ioanidinnis put it pretty well when mentioning that we should recognize the problems and be forthright with them. Not entrench ourselves to the level of antivaxxers because it might give them an inch. Not admitting issues gives them more credence.

medicine,"I have a counter-question.

I'm going to assume the bulk of the cost of an MRI is the actual machine, followed closely by staffing costs (MRI techs + radiologist). Maintenance is usually done as a service contract - AKA pay us X per year, and we'll handle all maintenance. Any other cost is immaterial.

So the cost of the MRI is fixed. And if we have the staff for the scans, we're paying them regardless if patients come through or not. In other words, there's no real cost with doing more MRI's to the hospital, assuming we don't need to start going into OT pay for a backlog of patients. (Which brings up the ""24/7 MRI staffing"" debate, but let's pretend that it's either 24/7 staffed, or there's no overflow into non-working hours)


So now that we've tentatively established that a MRI will cost the same regardless of how many patients come through, what does it matter with the insurance company trying to control the number? Throwing out a number, let's say it costs 50k per day to operate the MRI machine. If 10 patients are seen, the hospital's going to need to bill 5k per patient to cover costs. If 50 patients are seen, the hospital will need to bill 1k per patient to cover the MRI cost.

So wouldn't restricting the flow of patients that get MRI's simply drive the cost of the MRI's up per patient, resulting in insurance companies paying out the same amount at the end of the day?

This is ignoring the negative medical effects of scans and imagining on a person, and simply looking at the finances. "

medicine,"I'm a little familiar with the med center.  What numbers are you referring too?  If you're talking 85% survival, that's low but on par with someplace like Duke or Stanford according to SRTR.  Consider also less than 100 transplants are evaluated so a few bad outcomes can skew that percentage greatly.  From what it seems, there was a transition period with surgeons and issues came up, then the hospital tried to fix it.  Unfortunately some patients died in the process.  Maybe the hospital made a bad hire, but obviously heart transplants are complex and risky and the very sickest patients.  Complications amplify the scenario and this piece seems like a emotional story trying to use medicare/registry supplied data (which we know can be skewed) to strengthen their piece.  I see stuff like this happen (non-cardiac) but it's just not as dramatic because it rarely leads to mortality.

Most countries have unionized rates from 10-25% with a few that stand out as much higher. Rather than lumping the US as uniquely anti union Id say they’re more in line with the majority that have these lower rates.

Not to mention the US may lack unions for certain fields but makes up for it with lobbyists, which to the extent you see in the US is somewhat unique. Physicians don’t really need to unionize because instead we organize and form large lobbying groups. Rather than asking to give money to a union you’ll be asked to give money to a PAC.

I think Americans are disproportionately paying the R&amp;D costs compared to these other countries. If America was to do something similar, I think we would have less overall drug development. How much less, of course, is debatable. Is it worth having affordable drugs for everyone or more cures but not \(initially, during the patent\) available for everyone? That is an ethical question that can be much debated. I do wonder if it could be cost neutral/saving for the government to massively increase spending on pharmaceutical research, with the idea that any drugs discovered through it in the future would be then sold at it’s marginal cost of production, saving money for Medicare/Medicaid.

Drugs are also complicated when it comes to the issue of justice and access to healthcare. Most people feel icky thinking that a person might die because of an inability to pay for a medication. However, the drug that might save you could be $10 but the drug that saves me might be $100,000/month. Medications are not as substitutable as other resources, like food. If someone is starving, an apple and a filet mignon are about equal. That doesn’t hold for drugs."

medicine,"At least, at my academic center, there are plenty of physicians who you never know are DOs until you get a really good look at their badges. If a DO graduate enters an allopathic residency, there will be little to distinguish him/her from an MD from that point forward, other than exposure to some cooky ideas in the past. 

Personally, I thought some of their ""pillars"" of DOness were cool, like, the human body has the ability to heal itself, and physicians are just facilitators of that process. Also, they churn out a ton of primary care docs who will go on to work in underserved areas. You can't knock that."
medicine,"Yes. States vary by whether they ask if you've ever been treated for e.g. depression and, if so, whether they ask at initial licensure, for renewal, or both. But there are states where admitting that you have been treated for depression can cost you your license, or at the very least will predictably force you to jump through expensive, humiliating, and unnecessary hoops to prove that you're capable of practicing."

Pasting my question: 

&gt; Been playing with an idea recently, is verbal charting feasible? Or would it be too clunky? 

&gt; To respond to your request, how to reconcile the variation across providers? What about the providers that won't take the time to customize but want the same thing? 

&gt; What if it was 2 clicks for basic common chart with more clicks into more detailed customizable info?  And charting was entered verbally? How much verbal gymnastics like ""Alexa start a prog note using my default template"" or ""Alexa start a new risk assessment"" would be acceptable?"

Most surgeons/proceduralists will operate on anything less than 1.7, because it won't bleed much more in practice than something lower than that, and you can usually get someone from 2-3 down to ~1.5 with a single IV dose of 10mg of Vit K and waiting overnight."

medicine,"The bigger issue is the revolving door. They arrive in the ER septic, get a few days of IV antibiotics, feel well enough to leave and go shoot up again, disappear off the ward AMA, and then once the partially treated infection takes hold again they return. We had one woman with 18 admissions over three months who would repeat that pattern every single time. It got to the point where we had to write up a special protocol just for her to minimize health care spending each time. Many of these people have no health cards (I'm in Canada) so the hospital foots the bill and the government won't even pay the docs for their care. Most of them are perfectly capable of acquiring one but are too lazy or apathetic to do so because they know we won't just toss them out. We'll have social work find them housing, we have an inpatient addictions team that will do methadone/suboxone starts and followups, but the resources are generally ignored and squandered. 

I'm not sure we have a great solution. One of my staff had suggested outpatient IV antibiotics at future safe injection sites in town (they're starting to pop up across Canada). Force patients to finish their 6 weeks as a condition of using the site and this would avoid sending people home with a PICC. I thought it was an interesting concept. "

I do have a question for you or others.  So I am a nurse in the ICU, been here 2.5 years.  Anyways, nursing school, journals, etc. Never talk about Centor Criteria, Ottawa Ankle Criteria, etc. (At least I don't remember them).  Obviously we're not able to diagnose and write orders ourselves, but I'm curious what these criteria are.  Other than having a better understanding of a physicians thought process, can you think of a potential benefit it may lend me?

medicine,"Similar, but psychologists receive additional training in administering and interpreting tests. Social workers can legally do some kinds of testing, but you are less likely to find a social worker with testing in our scope of competence (even in places where it is legally in our scope of practice) because we have less education in this area. Where I work, we have clinical social workers and psychologists with the exact same job descriptions, because the psychologists don't test, either. "
medicine,"any treatment that utilizes another living(are viruses even living?) organism presents with a possibility of attacking an unintended target, or mutation leading to unanticipated effects.

By consenting to be treated by a physician at a training hospital patients are also consenting to receive care from that physician's trainees and mid-levels. As long as patients are made aware of what exams and procedures the student will be doing as part of the care I see no issue with the first statement.

Decided to pursue medicine again and am starting med school in August. I'm also hoping it's not as bad as the people on here and /r/medicalschool say. My girlfriend is an MS2 and is really enjoying it at least, so at least one person is. I work at a community hospital in a town of about ~100k people, and every doctor, attending or resident, I've talked to there has been really encouraging and say that they love working in medicine. Not sure if the practice environment has anything to do with the unhappiness for others.

I think it's easier for you and me as well. We can work in software and escape the debt if we decide the doctor life isn't for us. I can't imagine how it is for others who don't like it and are stuck.

Maybe I would have stayed in tech if I had a job as a data scientist, in computational drug discovery, or in bioinformatics rather than working with Ruby on Rails and Android, but those jobs are much more scarce and also can also require additional training, either masters or PhD.

It’s when the providers are cold to the kid that they start to worry, gotta play nice with them. "
medicine,"As a nurse I’m not really sure. I think they discuss the overall case with someone more senior but do they check in with every single decision or just the overall plan?

medicine,"So in principle the guy is right.  It is a no brainer that clinical experience will contribute to clinical skills.  However, it probably doesn't follow a nice linear relationship, rather, an ""Emax"" type model... Don't they say that clinical acumen maxes a couple years post residency, then declines?  From what I understand, they used a ANOVA model, which is linear by design, so that won't work.

They have consistently shown better functional outcomes on validated scores and now that we are seeing decades worth of follow-up data we see that they have less mortality than non-tPA patients. The mental gymnastics to blanket say it doesn’t work is frankly flat-earth level of denial.

Could selection be better? Yes. There are patients with varying degree of collateral flow that dictates whether their stroke completes quickly or slowly. Fast progressors probably don’t do as well with tPA, but we don’t know how to identify them. Perfusion imaging is emerging as a tool to help with this, but that doesn’t mean you withhold treatment until we have that tool validated. Time is still our best surrogate, and it’s good enough to help patients. It’s not perfect, but it’s better than nothing.

This week the NEJM published a new RCT (Wake Up) that again showed statistically significant improvement with tPA compared to placebo. Again, hemorrhage was significantly higher in the treatment arm but let me tell you a secret...seeing blood on the CT doesn’t clinically matter as a side effect if the patient does better than if they didn’t get the drug! AKA not all hemorrhage = harm.

NINDS has shown benefit of tPA (and it’s been reanalyzed over and over, by the FDA and independent reviewers after allegations of poor data practices). ECASS3 was a wash but maybe trended towards tPA being better than placebo. All of the thrombectomy trials in 2015 (MR CLEAN, SWIFT PRIME, etc) used tPA and data has shown that thrombectomy without tPA doesn’t work as well. WAKE UP has shown that patients treated with tPA did better than those without.  Plenty of prospective and retrospective observational registries have consistently shown not only benefit of tPA but have demonstrated external validity by reproducing numbers akin to these trials.

There’s a reason withholding tPA within the 3 hour window is malpractice. And it’s not a conspiracy; it’s because the drug works. No published RCT has shown harm with tPA that outweighs the benefits. 

If it helps, think about it like surgery. Every surgery has complications and risk, but the surgeons operate when the benefit outweighs the risk. A good neurologist gives tPA when the benefit outweighs the risk. Like a good surgeon, a good neurologist knows when not to give tPA too. "

Then at the end he dictated his note aloud in front of the patient which allowed him to hear the information again as well as allowed the patient another chance at input. He is a very good doctor. 

He also lamented that autopsies are no longer performed for deaths not suspected to be criminal in nature. He said in the 1960s when he was an intern, people who died in the hospital got autopsies and frequently there were surprises. The person you thought died of an MI actually had a massive PE post hospitalization. The person who died of a PE, turns out they had cancer that had made them hypercoagulable. He said it was very humbling and that it is a shame they are not done more often.

I do disagree with the idea that medical education has not changed. I think with high quality clinically-oriented question banks like UWORLD that students go through over and over and that provide just the sort of tricky, vague scenarios that lead to misdiagnoses, education improves dramatically. The question bank is also great about illnesses with similar presentations and doing 40 questions in a row constantly challenges your availability heuristic. There is in fact probably the opposite of it, where you get 2 questions on the same topic and you intrinsically don’t think you’ll get 2 questions on the same topic, as if you assume total randomness and it doesn’t happen."

The educated professionals tell patients what the appropriate treatment is, and that is what will be provided.

medicine,"Referencing your claim that activation of TLR2 causes 'an AIDS like scenario's, that's not how TLRs work. TLRs are expressed on various cells, part of the innate immune system, and recognize substances found on bacteria, viruses and fungi and activate the signalling cascade that starts the immune response. This immune activation happens every time you get an infection with a new pathogen and it's a normal immune response. The purpose of the vaccine is to promote this kind of response so that specific antibodies against whatever pathogen you're vaccinating for are produced and that information is stored in memory cells. This process is totally normal and your body can handle it very well.

Just please, please, please read an immunology book before going around confusing people with misinformation."

medicine,"&gt;That the court ruling that it was better that Alfie die immediately than for the parents to be allowed to transfer care to another set of competent and qualified doctors is a very slippery slope.

Parents should be allowed a second opinion. They should be allowed to do what is in the best interest of the child. 

Should they be allowed to harm a child in their search for doctors with views compatible to theirs? 

As /u/ChazR elegantly pointed out, the team (doctors AND nurses) at Alder Heys have known this patient for a year. They've obviously rounded on him, talked to his parents, and taken care of him every single day. 

Who else would be a better patient advocate for this child? The Italian/Munich team who've spent a fraction of their time, and in doing so agreed that this child had no hope of recovery?

If the doctors truly felt that it was in the child's best interest that no further procedures be done, it is their obligation to stop the transfer. "

TEFCA is quite likely to just make this worse, at least as currently proposed.

&gt; Also - if you don’t have a health system with an integrated pharmacy, or you don’t use your health system’s pharmacy. Your doctor’s EMR can be fairly blind to what actual meds you’re on.

medicine,"Yeah totally agree with this - I have coped with anxiety/depression issues throughout residency. I reached out to our mental health office and they indicated all information would be taken in the context of my job and if they had any concern I could be removed from clinical duties. Since that is so nebulous of a proposition and I had no documented performance issues I obviously declined (I also needed an income to support my family ... LIKE EVERY FUCKING ADULT). I ended up doing OK over time however residency was the worst years of my life. This was in the midst of PGY 2-3, taking Q2 or Q3 call, with regular duty hour violations. I actually developed a physical health issue requiring me to find Saturday appointments or hope a nice chief would let me get a test done. I literally had no outlet beyond my family, and without their support who knows what would have happened. 

I realize in retrospect part of it was my old PD who refused to acknowledge any health and personal problems without being punitive. I brought the issues up to him and did ask for some time away to be made up, he basically said ""if your performance declines we will not renew your contract"" and "" I do not want to ever hear you say you are tired or having ""personal problems"", that is not my issue to deal with"". He also tried to not renew the contract of a resident with breast cancer so he could hire someone else. Not surprisingly our program was reported to ACGME, we got a site review and serious violations were found - he was forced to leave.... to a better paying job at a nicer hospital (hahahaha)  

In the end it is mostly a system problem, but also a culture problem. I have learned a lot in training and one of the most important things is to remember that physicians are people. We are not robots able to perform at peak performance 24/7. We as a field NEED to acknowledge this.

A great starting point would be a campaign for medical boards to stop treating mental health, physical health, substance issues punitively. Some states even post this on their public license search!!"

B) I have no idea of the veracity of any of the claims, but it sounds like over the couple of days the patient was evaluated by multiple physicians at different times (PGY1, PGY4, Fellow at least. Attending isn't mentioned). I have no clue what information each did or did not have available since the charts would have been paper at that time, but it's entirely likely there was a failure of ""handoffs"" of information from doc to doc. This is an even more common problem now that trainees are working shorter shifts.

C) It sounds like when the feces hit the fan, the intern called the fellow with a possible plan (does the patient need an NG tube?) and the fellow reasoned as response (""no""). 

D) The patient had an incredibly rare condition that probably would have killed them regardless."

Then why are you bitter about this ?  

Everyone else has already told you that ITE serve a valuable purpose and correlate with board passing rates. 

What solution would you come up with ? "
medicine,"You said it- because death MAY be worse than suffering.  And it is not my place, nor is it the court's place to judge that question.  But suffering may be worse than death too- hence why parents can and do make decisions to take their children off of life support.  It is a question that medicine can never answer with certainty, hence why defer to parents.

And I don't know that what we do for Down's syndrome and HIE patients is all that different than what we could do for Alfie.  Some of them have profound intellectual disabilities and could never express themselves verbally to say ""I want to live"", or even understsnd what life is.

But no one I think supports creating a commission to go around and judge which child should get heart surgeries, orthopaedic procedures, trachs, and PEGs to prolong their lives for various amounts of time, and which child should be allowed to pass away immediately because their life is worse than death.  And yet, that is exactly what this decision and the grounds it was made on ultimately boil down to."

medicine,"I remember listening to an interview or something with Ezekiel Emanuel where he pointed out that when we look at healthcare spending + other social services spending as a percent of GDP that we are pretty much on par with the other wealthiest nations of the world. There are lots of studies suggesting social services spending correlates more closely with health outcomes than healthcare spending. It's not difficult to imagine from the clinic how your patients might be healthier if they had better access to food, housing, assistance in finding a jobs, and taking care of their children. In the US we choose to have a minimalist social safety net and it's pretty easy to buy that as a significant factor in the poor health of our population and the amount of money we spend trying to fix those health problems.

medicine,"Speaking from the perspective of insurance (I know, I'm Satan - but hold the phone, I work in accident insurance; health insurance is for suckers). 

This whole system is fucked - particularly for doctors. Your own profession works against your long-term health. Why?

Simply put, its a supply and demand problem combined with a distribution problem. There aren't enough doctors, and the ones that are being trained are disproportionately pursuing specialties. Why? Because $$$. Medical education is expensive, and specialties are lucrative. That extra money is necessary to pay back the incredibly high (180k or so) or debt it takes to become a physician. 

But this is where your profession shoots itself in the face. You bill on a fee-for-service model. More services = more money. Fewer services = less money. If we trained more doctors, would you perform as many services? Likely, the answer is no. Would this impact your earnings? Over time, yes. Are you OK with that? You might be, but many others in your profession aren't. They've felt they ""earned"" it while not recognizing that medicine - while a unique service - is still a service. Like all services, it is subject to economic forces. That's what is killing your profession. 

The best solution is Medicare for all. Administration is easier. Everyone would be able to get care. And we as a society would have a reason to better fund physician training. The ultimate result for physicians, I suspect, is working fewer hours (yes, for lower reimbursement) but a better quality of life. You'd all be happier...and so would everyone else - because our doctor wouldn't be seeing us during the 23rd hour of a 24 hour shift.

medicine,"Long post that completely missed the point... I said we need a regulated system. Clearly what we had in the past and to some extent now is broken. But what we’re switching too with no interaction with pharma and physicians is much worse. Every example and study you provided to show why it’s a problem is based on an unregulated system. With appropriate regulations we can create incentives that force pharma reps to do more education than just marketing propaganda and incentivize physicians to learn about new products that will help patients. Have a stronger FDA that makes sure that every drug that gets approved is done so because it will help patients. And a regulatory body and peer review process that checks how pharma reps are educated and what they tell physicians at these lunches or meetings. Such a system is certainly the most ideal situation and it’s impossible to argue otherwise. Everyone is incentivized to do something good for the system because of appropriate regulations. A market system of appropriately regulated incentives will always function better than something completely controlled by tax money or physician money sent to your specialty organization.

Also there’s no evidence that marketing increases the costs of meds. In fact Americans use more meds than any other country which offsets the marketing costs. and while part of that higher use is due to overuse from marketing non FDA approved indications another big part is better access. More people with their meds that they need. For drug companies America is the most profitable place to innovate and sell drugs because access to medications is better here. And so the marketing costs are offset by that increase usage. Sure we need better regulation in the system, but the fixes you’ve suggested are certainly not what’s best for the physician and the patient."

It seems that what patients want the most is a definitive date. They wanna know if they have 3 months, or a year, or 5. But you should never lie to them and give them false hope - you gotta be honest: Tell them you can't know for sure, as every case is different, but in other cases like theirs, usually the life expectancy should be somewhere between X and Y. It seems that too many oncologists feel the almost irresistible urge to give them a specific date, and worse, to guess on the higher end of the scale, as a way of somehow comforting the patient and getting that pressure off of them, but very often their time will be up before that due date and they will resent you and docs as a whole.

I was trying to stay up even though there were no patients in labour - I knew nobody would bother calling me if something happened, so I was sitting at the nursing station trying to keep my eyes open. The nurses were all sitting in little circles chatting, and every time I tried to join the conversation about vacations, or kids, I got a look like “why are you speaking to us”. (This isn’t me hating on nurses - just trying to describe how isolating it was) 

Finally we got called to do an ectopic from the ED. The ORs for gyne in the middle of the night are a 5 minute walk from labour and delivery down these long deserted hallways. I distinctly remember walking 10 feet behind the resident and attending as they chatted about something non medical and made absolutely no effort to include me. 

I don’t think they did it intentionally but half running down the hallways after them (I’m short and they were both tall men) in the middle of the night honestly made me feel so alone and invisible. I didn’t know how I could make it through that call shift, never mind the rest of training/life. "

I have little sympathy for providers who feel pressured to practice defensive medicine out of a of a fear of litigation. What is evidence based and right for the patient should always prevail. That is the philosophy and action of the physicians I work with.

That's not the best way to start a meaningful conversation. We're all friends here.

&gt;*Global peace? As of 2014, there were only 11 countries not involved in one conflict or another.*

That's not a terribly meaningful metric, it doesn't control for scale. The War of Jenkin's Ear was a conflict. So was WW2. ISIS has killed less people in 4 years than a single day on the Somme.

&gt;*And even if you look at world metrics where things are getting better by almost every measure, giving the credit to militarism is beyond insane.*

I think you're correct in your assessment but I'd point to the American military as the cause. The sheer size of Uncle Sam makes militarism in other countries unfeasible. 

Wars are primarily between near-peers. When nobody can match The Big Iron, no war. That's the thinking the past few decades at least.

&gt;*You finish by pointing a finger at hospitals and education, as though nothing in this world matters as long as you get yours.*

Dad went to college for $6k a year. Mine was $40k. I guarantee you I didn't get $34k extra value. College suffers from cost disease to a far greater extent than *even literally the damned military*.

This doesn't have to be zero sum. I'm in support of far greater taxes to pay for education. Get yourself a government that can do both.

&gt; *Hospitals and schools should be temples. We should pay teachers six figure salaries and pull the best educators from around the world to ensure our children grow up with the maximum possible potential.*

I have an alternative line of thought on this: ""I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy. "" We live in a world where we can treasure these things because we've established security. Without security and a unipolar world, we go back to the 1900s. Frankly, *fuck that*.

Her: ""I was feeling really weird the day before the election, so I went to bed super early at 7pm and when I woke up I was in the hospital and that A$$hole was president.""

I was seeing her the day after Clinton said that she wasn't going to forgive people who didn't vote so I said: ""Well, Clinton says she won't forgive people who didn't show up to the polls, but you had a stroke, so I think she'll forgive you.""

Her:  ""Oh, I never would have voted for her in a million years.""

Me: ""Um, those were kind of the two options.""

Her: ""Yeah, I mean, I sort of liked the old guy, but you can't vote for someone that old.""

medicine,"I think a big part of it is that we are brainwashed from the very beginning of the process.  Before we are even accepted into medical school, it is hammered into us that we must always put the needs of others before our own.  Our worth as applicants is measured by the number of volunteer experiences on our resume, and we are asked to write essays extolling the virtues of altruism.  It is taboo to talk to attendings or med school/residency interviewers about salary/benefits or quality of life matters.  It’s no wonder, then, that by the time we are residents, or fellows, or attendings, we are conditioned to not speak up about the issues that affect us - the crushing debt, the lack of sleep, the time away from our families, the increasing patient loads and decreasing time at the bedside - for fear of being perceived as selfish, which is not a characteristic of a Good Doctor.  When we talk about physicians being bad at advocating for themselves, this is one of the reasons why."

medicine,"Perhaps in your hospital.  

For our hospital, when it comes to sick patients, it's quite nice to have someone literally 5 minutes from the bedside at all hours of the day or night.  Someone whose entire job is to deal with acute medical conditions, Someone who spends a significant amount of their time caring for patients with hip fractures, and is intimiately aware of the precarious nature of their disposition, how subtle changes in their exam or labs can portend a complete physiologic decompensation.  

It almost sounds like you think an acute care hospitalist service is a disservice to patients.  I can tell you that in my experience it is not.

medicine,"While food might be fine, you should try to find out if your docs like other things instead.

I don't really like cookies. I mean, they are fine and I'll eat certain ones. But if a nurse buys me a fresh cold Diet Mtn Dew bottle or even better, a fresh fountain Diet Dew because I'm stuck in the ER all night and can't leave? OMG that will make my night every time 100&amp;#37;. But I'm kind of weird like that.

Also, this may be more of an ER thing, but just any effort to help me not have to go into the room for every single update. If I tell the patient my plan and that they are being discharged after a certain lab comes back negative. Please try not to ask me to ""can you go back in and update them on that lab test?"" Please just TRY to tell the patient it was negative for me. It will really help my flow. And if the patient or family asks ""can I talk to the doctor again"" sometimes ""no"" is an acceptable answer.

When I have been a patient or a patient's parent during admissions, when I asked to talk to the doctors, if it wasn't rounding time the answer was almost always ""no"" or ""I'll ask them your question and let you know"". But it seems when I'm working in the ER when patients ask it's just assumed I'll run in ASAP to the healthy patient with 0 lab abnormalities and talk to them for another 10 minutes about how their complaint isn't emergent because I don't have anything else better to do apparently. It's really frustrating."

I remind students who do neurology rotations with me: if you believe something is a TIA, you must be willing to state what blood vessel (territory) was involved. And if there was a fresh mark (diffusion) on MRI, it was a stroke, not TIA, no matter how long the symptoms lasted.

You do speak german, right? Because that’s the first and most important thing. Do you already have a position at the Klinikum Augsburg? Do you have the contract or at least a written statement that they will employ you once you’re allowed to work there. I think a contract of employment will help you get your supplies recognized as well as getting your „Aufenthalts- und Arbeitsbewilligung“.

In addition to other things that we generally don't say out loud for the patient's comfort/privacy but need to be communicated and verified - code status, HIV status, mental health issues; or stuff like the patient's family dynamics. I don't know that you'd ever get away from having a written interface for charting and as long as it exists people will find it hard not to resist the temptation to add on to it. Like for example we have been paperless for years, but slowly we've added back more and more paper forms which need to be scanned into the chart because of admin/legalese...and checkbox creep continues.

medicine,"It's the hard cases that make the news. This is an example. There is no right or wrong. It's about measuring evidence, weighing the unknowns, and making a decision based on the balance.

In this case, there were two treatment options: remove life support in a controlled manner and let the child die, or continue life support until the child died. That's it.

The court could have ordered Alder Hey to continue life support. It could have ordered discherging to the care of the Italian facility, which would entail all the usual risks of air transport of a terribly sick young child.

The court decided to allow Alder Hey to let the child's physicians do their job as they saw fit in their medical judgement.

medicine,"It obviously depends on the situation, and if we are talking young previously healthy post-trauma I would most likely disregard it, at least until I had spoken to the family - but even 20-year-olds have a right to deny healthcare interventions if they don't want them.

But in this case, we are talking about a 70-year-old man with COPD, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation who developed a metabolic acidosis of 6.81, where they attempted to treat the acidosis for several hours at an ICU.

Surviving cardiopulmonary resuscitation after that isn't exactly awesome, nor is it likely. It is probably enough that I would consider a DNR &amp; DNI order regardless of the patient's wishes. 

In such a situation I think I would honour it, but I agree that it is a good idea to continue with the reversible course of action until you have made a decision."

Interestingly I joined some arthritis and pain support groups a couple of years ago for  support  (I have a type of RA that is munching my joints) There was a lot of people with fibromyalgia in said groups, which was fine as pain is pain and would think  that is common ground. There was  a very vocal minority who would try an one-up each other in terms of victimhood level, they would give scarily dangerous medical/meds advice, gang up on others and complain they couldn't get enough narcotics.

As far as I'm concerned, the receiving facility can do whatever they want once they get the patient--our job in this instance is to get the patient safely there. Even if they pull them right when the patient hits the unit, that doesn't mean it was a waste to put them in, it means the patient got there safely. "

&gt;Background: 

&gt;The Consensus Statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel 2017 concludes on the basis of 3 different types of clinical studies that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) causes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In Mendelian randomization studies, rare genetic mutations affecting LDL receptor function were found to cause higher or lower LDL-C levels, which are associated with correspondingly altered ASCVD risk. In prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of statins, a remarkably consistent log-linear association was demonstrated between the absolute magnitude of LDL-C exposure and ASCVD risk. The EAS Statement proposes that any mechanism of lowering plasma LDL concentration should reduce the risk of ASCVD events proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL-C and the cumulative duration of exposure to lower LDL-C. However, as we explain, we do not find this conclusion acceptable. 

&gt;Summary: 

&gt;Our review points out that different interpretations are possible for the results of Mendelian randomization studies. As for prospective cohort studies, many inconsistent reports on the association of LDL-C and ASCVD were disregarded when drafting the Statement, reports with and without genetic factors related to LDL receptor function should be analyzed separately, and the term ASCVD in the Statement is used inappropriately because myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction differ in their association with LDL-C. As for RCTs, clinical reports on statins published before and after the implementation of new regulations affecting clinical trials (2004/2005) should not both be included in meta-analyses because the evaluated efficacy of statins changed markedly, and the irreversible adverse effects of statins need to be evaluated more rigorously now that their mechanisms have been elucidated. 

&gt;Key Messages: 

&gt;Apart from the EAS hypothesis that LDL causes ASCVD, recent pharmacological/biochemical studies, as summarized in this review and elsewhere, have revealed that atherosclerosis is caused by statins taken to lower LDL-C, as well as by warfarin and some types of vegetable fats and oils, in the absence of significantly elevated LDL-C levels. Thus, the promotion of statin treatment by the Statement is rather risky and we do not feel that the conclusions are justified for the prevention of ASCVD.

medicine,"They were definitely a joke at my institution, with the exception of the ALSO which is pretty serious, and technically we're supposed to be certified in all of them. I mean, *technically* I'm certified to do neonatal resuscitation (NRP), which is an absolute joke, because my two weeks in NICU consisted of me taking care of a few NAS babies and the attending basically did everything, I just wrote the notes and cuddled them a bit when they were withdrawing.

My main hospital has no pediatricians/peds and only has OBs during the day time on weekdays, so if there's a pediatric condition or imminent delivery it's the family med service running the code, with possible help fro the intensivist if they're still in house. At night it's just the FM residents, and *technically* ED docs, but most of them are IM trained.

I'm trying not to think about doing nights next year as the FM night senior if there's an imminent delivery and one of the... less than stellar ED docs is the one in the ED that night. Luckily our OB hospital is only a 15 minute drive away and is a fantastic OB hospital. But seeing a crowning baby in my ED at night is literally my biggest fear as a resident, and I haven't actually done my ALSO course yet either."

Many providers put too much emphasis on peripheral white blood cell counts (WBC) to diagnose or exclude a serious bacterial illness.  I frequently point out cases to my learners of meningitis,  bacteremia, or acute osteomyelitis where the WBC is normal.  And the inverse is true as well,  I have seen kids get admitted for nothing more than an elevated WBC.  "

medicine,"Just visiting here. I dropped out of medical school because I saw the path to burnout.

... There is a trend in capitalistic cultures to find a profession that creates value out of thin air \(in medicine especially\), and attempt to shackle that person with so much shit until they collapse from it. Administrative, educational, you name it. Of course they are going to encourage you to work harder, the same way you'd whip a horse to run faster. It's pretty well known people in certain professions commit suicide at higher then the background rate. Doctors are a tremendous economic engine, a tremendous source of power. Why should doctors get all that money?

Primary care doctors used to make house calls. The profession fits into a bag. Society has convinced us we need a building, admin staff, lab staff, billing people, janitorial workers, IT, managers, etc. It goes on on and on. At the end, there is one person, doing medicine. Everyone else is fucking optional. All those optional people need to be paid. All those optional people only exist because the doctor exists.

Look at teachers. Someone with knowledge talking to a student. How could this be expensive? Tack on a sports stadium, fitness centers, wellness programs, legal assistance, administrators, etc, etc, etc, until ... the costs spiral so far out of control you are basically charging a house \(a real physical thing that needs to be built on land\) for sitting in a classroom. At some point so much money is changing hands, extra costs are meaningless. ""Well, it's already expensive why not add [a lazy river](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/one-schools-formula-for-athletic-success-build-a-lazy-river-and-hope-the-recruits-will-come/2017/03/31/e1b7f5c8-1568-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f27e0f095bcc)?""

But we've tacked on, admin staff, building staff, support staff, IT staff, legal staff, marketing, insurance, certificaiton, social media, finance. Everyone has their hands in the cookie jar. Everyone feels that since everyone has their hands in the cookie jar, one more hand won't matter.

All jobs that provide real value are tied to jobs that don't. What value does the insurance adjuster bring? The medical billing coder? The marketing guy? How many people are involved in healthcare who've never actually talked to a patient? Who's getting paid better, the doctors, or the administrators? Who has better hours? Better benefits? Who is constantly told to ""work harder?"" Who is it that does the telling?

medicine,I have only done them on pig tracheas. My flight team uses the Melker cric kit(Seldinger technique) and you secure the trach just like a regular trach(with ties). In TAPTC they teach you to use a bougie and ETT. The instructors used IV tubing to secure the ETT around the neck. Tie it around the tube-wrap around the neck-tie it again to the tube. It’s amazing how plastic on plastic does not slip at all. Of course this technique could be easily used on a regular oral ETT with a patient with facial burns. Atleast until Shriners comes and staples the tube to the palate!

medicine,"Could your patients afford $50-100/month for intranasal ketamine? I understand the hesitation but you are not a trailblazer here. Indeed there has been good research done on intranasal ketamine for depression and you are fully within your rights to rx meds however you see fit. Having studies to support your inclinations should help put your worries to rest. 

The way I practice medicine, when having to make a decision is this: Does the harm outweigh the benefits? In this case, ketamine won’t kill anybody. I’m not god, I can’t prevent all bad things from happening, like diversion, but I can use medicines that have some evidence of efficacy to try to help patients who are really struggling. I don’t know your patient population at all, of course, but I am the last doctor many patients see. I have the benefit of having mainly educated, wealthy patients, but they still are suffering horribly and they have almost given up. If there’s a medicine that may help them and I can prescribe it, I will, so long as there’s some trend of evidence supporting its use. The harm of inaction greatly outweighs the small possibility of diversion and/or misuse. With ketamine, I sleep soundly because I know even if the patient injects a months supply in their arm, they won’t die, which is not guaranteed with other medicines that are more freely prescribed, e.g., opioids and benzos. 

I appreciate changing our habits and routines take time, but there’s a patient in front of me today. "
medicine,"Forget NYU then. Look up Mount Sinai's stats.

""The death at Mount Sinai comes amid a broader trend of physician suicides that are happening across the country. And the reaction of Mount Sinai as an institution is reflective of a broader crisis at our nation’s hospitals. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the rate of suicide among male physicians is 1.41 times higher than among men in the general population. For women, the risk is 2.27 times greater.
The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, the governing body of residencies, does not track suicides or suicide attempts, according to a spokeswoman. “However, the ACGME has done extensive research into the wellbeing of physicians in training,” the spokeswoman told Refinery29. And according to data published by the ACGME, between 2000 and 2014 66 residents died by suicide, the second-leading cause of death among all resident physicians after cancer."""

medicine," &gt;For physical activity, we classified low risk as &gt;30 min/d of moderate or vigorous activities (including brisk walking) that require the expenditure of at least 3 metabolic equivalents per hour. 

On pages 6 and 8 of the paper there's a pretty table and graph that looks like they include individual data for different levels of exercise (as well the other risk factors). 

They identify &gt;3.5 h/wk as their defined low-risk group, but have data for 0 h/wk, 0.1-0.9 h/wk, 1-3.4 h/wk, 3.5-5.9 h/wk, and &gt;6 h/wk.

Copy/paste of their stated limitations for extra:
&gt;The current study has several limitations. First, diet and lifestyle factors were self-reported; thus, measurement errors are inevitable. However, the use of repeated measures of these variables could reduce measurement errors and represent long-term diet and lifestyle. Second, we counted the number of lifestyle factors on the basis of the dichotomized value of each lifestyle factor, although the lifestyle factors were differentially associated with mortality. However, our analysis based on an expanded score considered different levels of each risk factor and yielded similar results. Third, we did not fully consider the baseline comorbid conditions and background medical therapies. "

Obviously it doesn't have to be 100, that was just an example.

The first study did have p-values close to .05, the second one did not.  Considering the small sample sizes, and the small effect sizes (like you mention), you would not expect very small p-values.  It is speculation whether the authors are actually guilty of p-hacking.

And I don't know what you mean when you say there was no change in the primary outcomes?  Do you mean no clinical significance?  Because if the change is not clinically significant, but truly statistically significant (meaning no p-hacking), then it suggest the change is generalizable to the population, albeit very small, but it is still change."

Officials from Hamas and other militant factions addressed the worshipers, urging them into the fray and claiming — falsely, to all appearances — that the fence had been breached and that Palestinians were flooding into Israel.

&gt;Several speakers reserved their harshest words for the United States and its decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem. “America is the greatest Satan,” said a cleric, holding his index finger in the air as hundreds of people did the same. “Now we are heading to Jerusalem with millions of martyrs. We may die but Palestine will live.” The crowd repeated the chant.

Maybe Hamas should focus on building more trauma centers before they urge people to rush the militarized border of a country with superior weaponry. If a bunch of ""martyrs"" (aka suicidal religious lunatics) stormed your country, what would you do? And if martyrdom is the goal, why seek medical attention at all?

I love (and donate to) MSF, I am not a Trump fan, nor do I agree with his decision to relocate the embassy, but the outrage over Israel repelling a massive attack by people who want to breach their border and kill them (and admit as much) on behalf of a terrorist organization is absurd. If suicidal lunatics were swarming your house or standing outside of your house trying to light it on fire, would you use deadly force? Who can honestly be surprised that deadly force/intent is met with deadly force/intent?

medicine,While you are not wrong I have to believe that the majority of strikes aren't going to last so long that most physicians  would be significantly hurt financially.  But you are correct and this is a concern for any kind of strike that will actually effect your pay (e.g. walk out strikes done in different industries).
medicine,The one that hurts when you press on it. You've got a lot to learn about this bone doctoring lark.
medicine,"&gt; If however, they say for instance ""because we are a university hospital, we have medical students here on training from time to time. The student will be performing the examinations under my guidance, and you are free to say stop if it becomes uncomfortable at any point""

So, if that is the entirety of your request, it is made with an assumption that the student will be performing the exam and that the person must realize that they can say no before it starts... it is essentially using your power as a physician to decide for the patient and leaving it up to them to realize that they can say no before feeling uncomfortable or before the exam even begins.  That is shady and is a way to abuse the power of your position to coerce a lack of a refusal of consent.  That's not the same as getting consent.

I say this as someone who gets practiced on all the time, has allowed his children to be examined by students, and who has the whole family involved in clinical and non-clinical research regularly.  I've been injured by a student and still consented every time afterward.  

Your comparison reads to me like someone who cares more about getting patients to grant access to students, or at least not say no, and less about providing accurate information to your patient, treating them like a human being worthy of respect, and requesting their help.  You come off as if you are owed this access and need to trick patients into not saying no.  That is really saddening to read.  I get that you are a human being and that you want to help students, but I don't feel like it needs to be one or the other.  I know, too, that this is your job and things can get routine and it can be hectic, etc.  Sometimes bad habits or ideas form, even with noble goals.  I'm assuming that you go here that way, but I hope you will take some time and consider that patients are humans and worthy of respect.  "

medicine,"It sucks that patients don't have the option for just a prefilled syringe with an appropriate needle attached. Yes, it will require more training, sure, fewer people may feel comfortable giving another person the injection, but it would make the medication way more accessible. The best target for a device like this would be parents since small children wouldn't be able to self administer an epi pen anyway. IM injections could be made a part of first aid courses. Plus those able to give IM injections could give epi, glucagon, terb, Benadryl, narcan with appropriate training on those medications. "

Whereas the surviving sepsis guidelines seem to require 30 ml/kg (about 2 litres in the 70 kg patient)

The idea of 'recognise and treat sepsis' is a fine one. The problem is guidelines which mandate a 'one size fits all' policy and completely ignore the myriad other reasons why this might not be applicable to a specific patient. Especially when these strongly worded guidelines are based on pretty scant evidence"

Smoking is the perfect example: Increased risk of dementia, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, etc. Yes, it shortens your life, but it also makes you more likely to be disabled before you die. Obesity/poor eating/lack of exercise are the same (MSK, frailty, Cardiac, T2DM, etc.), and so is over consumption of EtOH (liver issues, dementia)."

medicine,"My dad had a heart attack which lead to cardiac arrest, died and was resuscitated a couple minutes later. He came back with so much brain damage they said his brain was equivalent too someone that had had a stroke “everywhere in the brain” as opposed to a concentrated location.  He was having seizures all the time, was totally unconscious, on breathing tubes and his primitive reflexes (eye dilation, blinking, and pain reflexes) were inconsistent. We discussed leaving him on ventilator with seizure meds and sedatives- seeing if he improved but after a week and finally finding his health directive- realized the best action and what he wanted was to not be left in a “vegetative” state, dependent on machines. The palliative doctor, social worker, nurses and chaplain helped us process everything. What they would do to help him pass comfortably. 
The plan was to take him off the ventilator, give him a ton of morphine and Ativan and let him pass naturally but without any pain or discomfort. The doctor said based on the fact the ventilator was completely breathing for him (20 breaths per minute) that my dad wouldn’t last long after we took the breathing tube out. They said he might take a few breaths but possibly pass in minutes. On the scheduled day- we were all around him loving him, talking to him, praying over him, etc. The doctor pulled out the tube while we were crying hysterically. My dad breathing a little on his own ...and then just kept breathing. We expected him to die there and were all a mess but hours later he was still breathing unconsciously. He was breathing so much and his heart beat was so strong they had to move him to another room to create space for other ICU patients. For hours they kept giving him morphine and Ativan. No one slept the whole time 29 hours it took him to pass. we were all there with him the whole way through- watching his breathing slow down, hearing the sound of the “breathing/ death rattle” and being there when he passed. 
The point was that the doctors said it would take minutes and in reality it took 29 hours. Go, dad! "

medicine,"&gt; If so, please remember that MAST and ASK use an entirely different drug. Streptokinase comes from bacteria and is an exogenous compound. Recombinant tPA is a manufactured analogue to endogenous tPA and is more consistent with normal human physiology. To compare the two is inappropriate.

So this is a fair point, though I was just providing what I thought the other commentator was referring to.

&gt; ATLANTIS looked at a different timeline. If you isolate the patients in the 0-3 hour timeline then you find statistically significant benefit in favor of tPA. As some have pointed out in this and similar threads; however, that is not in line with the design of those trials.

Well, this is partly true.  ATLANTIS-A looked at 0-6 hours as the time window, and actually changed mid-study to 3-6 hours based on the results of NINDS.  So that I suppose I can understand, but is still amazing to me that it is thrown out when pro-tPA physicians are aggregating data to make tPA look better.  ATLANTIS-B, on the other hand, is looking at 3-4 hours and 4-5 hours, which is pretty much within the window that we use.  So what they're doing is not using the 0-3 hour window to cover up the deficiencies of 3-4.5 hours.  Again, ignoring this data - as I believe (and correct me if I'm wrong) the majority of meta-analyses do - is piss-poor statistics."

Vision did not change at all in that eye after surgery, pt did not appreciate an improvement. No abnormalities on OCT (fancy image of the macula at a cellular level - sometimes you can get swelling and things back there, especially after surgery). Eye still looks otherwise normal on exam.

Doctor orders visual field test (checks for loss of vision anywhere in the center or periphery). Lo and behold, there’s a visual field defect. Can’t remember the exact pattern as this was several years ago.

Pt doesn’t have any evidence of glaucoma. Sent for MRI (I think, possibly CT?). Brain tumor (pituitary adenoma if I recall correctly? Although I might be thinking of someone else). Doctor felt really bad about not suspecting it prior to cataract surgery.

He had it surgically removed and is doing great, vision recovered I believe. We never did do the second cataract surgery. Waiting on the cataract to get more significant."

medicine,"ACC/AHA guidelines *explicitly* identify four separate groups that need lipid therapy, which they reemphasized in their 2017 update:

(1) persons with clinical ASCVD (i.e., acute coronary syndromes, or a history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease of atherosclerotic origin);

(2) persons with primary elevations of LDL-C levels of 190 mg per dL (4.92 mmol per L) or greater; 

(3) persons with diabetes mellitus who are 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL (1.81 to 4.90 mmol per L) but without clinical ASCVD; 

(4) persons without clinical ASCVD or diabetes who have LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% or greater.

So they set their threshold at all diabetics over age 40 with an LDL &gt;70 need statins. The risk calculator in this population is used only to decide moderate vs high intensity statin.

AACE does the same in their 2017 lipid guidelines - people with DM are *automatically* in the ""high risk"" category and have a goal LDL &lt;100. A single additional risk factor puts people with DM in the ""very high risk"" category with a goal LDL &lt;70."

But if that ever got thru, it would be an ADDITIONAL tax to our current system.  That is not a solution.

medicine,"&gt; Results for sumatriptan are much better.

comparing the sumatriptan results to erenumab is apples and bowling balls. I'm not sure how you can compare the two since one is prophylactic.

Let's just say that each has a large placebo response.

I agree that the price is outrageous. $600 / month for the **LOW** (70mg) dose!

If you are one of the 'lucky' ones who need the 140 mg injection (actually two 70 mg injections), that's a cool $1200 / month.

&gt; 400 is a lot when sumatriptan is about 2 dollars to relieve a migraine.

I think there is a recommended limit on the number of sumatriptan doses recommended per month/day/week. My impression is that erenumab is primarily for people with 'refractory' chronic migraines. For them, it will be tremendously helpful to have another weapon, especially one that is longer acting.

medicine,"In Massachusetts, this exact issue has been proposed at various state levels. The idea of a 72-hour ""medical hold"" which is really an involuntary hospitalization has recently gained some traction after being shot down two years ago. Currently, it is being added as an amendment ([H4470](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H4470) amended from the governor's bill [H4033](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/190/H4033)), at least from what I understand, on a comprehensive substance abuse act bill. The Committee on [Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery](https://malegislature.gov/Committees/Detail/J18/190) on May 7, 2018 drafter an amended bill expanding the language for this section and forwarded it to the health care financing committee.

""Massachusetts law currently permits the emergency restraint and hospitalization of individuals who pose a risk of serious harm by reason of mental illness, but not for those suffering from substance abuse.  The proposed amendment would have extended the same emergency treatment measures to substance abusers.""

Under a section titled ""Emergency restraint and hospitalization of persons posing risk of serious harm by reason of mental illness""
It gives power to various physician or mid-level providers ""who, after examining a person, has reason to believe that failure to hospitalize such person would create a likelihood of serious harm by reason of an alcohol or substance use disorder may restrain or authorize the restraint of such person and apply for the hospitalization of such person for a 72-hour period at a facility. Such person shall only be hospitalized for a 72-hour period after receiving medical clearance by the treating clinician. A person shall not be hospitalized pursuant to this section at a facility operated by the department of correction or a house of correction""

Do any states have this as a law? My understanding was no. They do NOT have to have a ""mental illness"" apart from this disorder. This section is freestanding apart from those involuntarily held for mental illness causing potential danger to self and others. Edit: It seems like at least in Florida the Marchman act grants this power.

medicine,"Well, one difference is that repeat heart surgery is risky and requires a HUGE amount of resources when compared to the other conditions you mentioned. Each re-do sternotomy and re-manipulation of a valve is riskier than the last due to bleeding, risk for heart block/need for an eventual permanent pacemaker, etc. Add to that a patient who may be septic and/or in heart failure from a regurgitant infected valve, and you find yourself in a very high risk surgical situation. 

The best analogy I have seen in this thread is that we don't let people who are actively drinking get a liver transplant. The risks and the distribution of resources are too great, and the likelihood of the patient's ongoing behavior undoing it all is high."
medicine,"I'm sure every specialty is a little different but I found our boards questions very much ""by the book"" and formulaic. They weren't terribly reflective of every day practice. That said, they were pretty true to our in - service exams. Maybe a little easier?

Do you have a question bank or together by former residents or something similar? Online qbanks? Honestly I would start asking your former seniors how they studied and go from there.

As for your percentile I wouldn't put much stock in it. You almost certainly didn't study as hard for the in-service as you will for your boards. Most of my classmates studied like crazy intern year, crushed the in-service, then coasted. They all passed their boards. You will too. "

medicine,"There were over 2700 people who were wounded, over a thousand of whom with live fire. I wasn't there, but when I was in Palestine years ago and witnessed a protest, I saw about a hundred people protesting with a group of mostly teenage boys throw the odd rock at soldiers up on a wall and in response were shot at with rubber bullets and tear gas canisters, several of them hit with the tear gas canisters directly. If Monday was anything like that, there's probably a large percentage of participants in these protests yelling and making noise with a few throwing rocks or molotovs cocktails\- the IDF only reported one minorly injured soldier after weeks of protest."

I had been trying to deal with it by focusing on nutrition/health but was just exhausted basically. That is what made me go back to using the medication. I am working with a psychiatric specialist to taper correctly. I'm just concerned that my cognitive health never fully repaired from the first time after my recent research. My doctor now has been great but hasn't given me much advice on supplements that could help with the repair. So thank you! I will up my Vitamin D3 uptake (I have been taking prenatal as my multivitamin) Do you have an opinion on L-tyrosine, ALPHA -GPC/ choline type supplements?"
medicine,"&gt; basic, minimal social media connection

I think that's a contradiction in terms. Most any social media link will give you a fairly close and intimate look at somebody's life, with nothing basic or minimal about it. The media companies generally offer no good tools to limit or restrict access, either, other than just not connecting in the first place. 

I guess you could keep it professional if you only used LinkedIn, or if you maintained a business profile for your practice that stayed separate from your personal one, but that's not what most people mean when they say ""friends on social media."""

medicine,"'Plant based' is a dietary philosophy but it's meaningless as a nutritional term. Some folk myself included use it to refer to a diet that priorities vegetables, fruit, grains, and pulses over meat or processed food, and if you accept that then the Mediterranean, DASH, and Seventh Day Adventist diets would qualify comfortably and have pretty strong evidence supporting their health benefits. Low meat and high oily fish are important components of the Med diet specifically, whereas DASH is low salt and SDA is vegetarian. There is evidence that red and especially processed meat has specific risks if over-consumed, but if you are having chickpea and tomato salad already then some grilled chicken breast makes very little difference. 

Sometimes the word 'flexitarian' gets thrown around to refer to people who minimize but do not strictly avoid meat in their diets. Other folk use 'plant based' to mean vegetarian and/or vegan diets. And some, usually the ones with Instagram followings, include all sorts of nutritionally haphazard measures like drinking almond/coconut milk instead of dairy and refusing to eat 'sugar' but including lots of medjuul dates and agave syrup in everything. As far as I know there is not much evidence one way or the other regarding these dietary patterns, although flexitarian seems closer to vegetarian than the standard American diet. "

medicine,"My experience, unfortunately, has been yes. I actually want to be a psychiatrist and am currently undertaking an intercalated psychology degree to this end, but I certainly encountered a lot of skeptics amongst doctors regarding the validity of psychiatry. Far from a universal or even plurality view, but enough that it almost made me question whether I wanted to go into it early on.

The consensus amongst these individuals I tend to find is basically that obvious psychiatric pathology like Mania and Schizophrenia is clearly real, but any of:

 - Psychiatry as an approach is invalid and unhelpful
 - Psychiatric diagnoses are invalid because there is rarely an objective test of disease (i.e. psychiatry is largely based on syndromes)
 - Psychiatric treatment approaches are harmful 
 - Any more subtle stuff such as conversion/somatisation, adjustment, medically unexplained symptoms, personality disorders etc. is excessive medicalisation of everything

amongst laypeople, the number of people who seem to believe that psychiatrists are a bunch of power-tripping, untrained morons is both depressing and terrifying.

Bottom line: the wider view is definitely that Psychiatry is a valid specialty but I have personally encountered people who disagree with that both online and in person, throughout the course of my rotations.

I can also detect a downward spiral more quickly if I start getting odd texts from a pt, which I can then address before they blow up. 

I make it clear they can text me anytime between 7-2300. I’ve never had anybody make me regret giving out my number. I don’t give my number to every pt, just the ones that would most benefit. "

medicine,"I rotated in an area that was hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. The rule there was one and done for heart valves (if you’re lucky). The case always went to valve conference and if it was felt the person would relapse then they did not get a new valve (medical management only) unless absolutely necessary (severe valvular dysfunction, progressive EKG changes due to infiltration of electrical system, persistently positive blood cultures for 10+ days). Then if they came in again for a second valve the answer was always no. Not because of any moral reason, simply because we had too many heroin using patients with endocarditis and not enough cardiothoracic surgeons to fix them. We simply just did not have the resources (surgeons) to match the need. Also these patients were incredibly noncompliant and would unfortunately leave AMA before antibiotics were complete... only to show up a few days later requiring ICU level of care from sepsis, so the CT surgeons do not want to operate on someone who’s not going to follow up or be non-compliant because it’s dangerous. There’s a lot of treatments patients don’t qualify for if they show patterns of non-compliance such as transplants, expensive medications, etc. 

Merely my experiences not saying I agree with it or not. It’s incredibly difficult watching someone die when you know we have the treatment available, but that’s unfortunately what happens. "

As this conversation was happening, I walk in to the room, look at the X-ray that had just been shot, and ask what they thought was causing the free air under the diaphragm if not a perforation, which was also causing the peritonitis.

medicine,"US Here, I have privileges at several hospitals and it seems to differ from facility to facility. 

The most common I’ve seen is that all staff in the hospital that doesn’t work in the operating room wears their own scrubs in, and usually it’s an assigned color based off of position. RNs wear navy blue, nurse aides wear green, Respiratory Therapists wear grey, so on and so forth.

Physicians can wear street clothes on the wards, and it’s usually business or business casual, but they can also wear scrubs. Of the physicians that decide to wear scrubs, most of us just wear the ones that we can get from the operating room, but there are a few that wear their own, or a pair that is custom embroidered. 

When it comes to the operating room, some facilities have a scrub vending machine that dispense scrubs when you either scan your badge, or enter a code. Others just have stacks of scrubs on shelves. There are areas within the operating floor that are marked with red lines to indicate anyone passing that line must be wearing the issued scrubs and a surgical cap or bouffant.

I don’t see any reason why ward staff should have to wear issued scrubs, unless there are a few bad apples that have issues maintaining a clean, hygienic, and professional appearance. "

I think the difference here is that they're talking about a depot formulation used for other indications, not the short formulation we use for stim testing, but I actually have no idea about other indications for ACTH.

(Also, to be pedantic, ACTH stim testing isn't used to differentiate between central and primary AI, it's used to identify the presence of AI period. Even people with central AI will fail a stim test due to adrenal atrophy, as long as its been more than a few weeks since the central insult. And only primary AI is called Addisons, central AI is just central AI.)"

For BLS for HCP, you're definitely supposed to check pulse. It's in the guidelines. In 2 seconds you should be able to approximate a pulse rate (just tachy vs normalish vs brady. No exact number required on first assessment) and know the minimum systolic BP it could be to feel a pulse in a specific location (if you can feel a radial pulse it's &gt;80 systolic).

BTW, you can go up to 300mg/1mL but any higher and the powder will clump together. Higher concentration == less waste (back out the nose), which equals less total ketamine per month. I have most pts taking 200mg/1ml, so 20mg per spray, and they can dose however they want (up to a maximum dose inset, of course). 

Hope that helps. Most people seem to think 50mg/ml or 100mg/ml are the only options on intranasal. They are not. "

I think for non-hospital owned clinics, EPIC isn't even in the top 2. You might say that's because it is too expensive (i.e. the ""have-nots"") but it's also because outpatient EPIC is awful. Inpatient EPIC is the most flexible EMR I've ever had the pleasure to use, but I can't stand it's outpatient encounter handler (as I've seen it implemented)."

medicine,"The issue with transparency is that chargemaster rates are so high because they're trying to maximize reimbursement from insurance companies. You can't walk in to a hospital and say ""what's the cash rate/insurance rate"" for any given procedure and have them quote you two different prices. The only ""official"" price is the chargemaster. That doesn't mean a hospital won't accept less money from a cash pay patient, but they don't, from the outset, look at your pay status and generate two different bills, which is what you appeared to be saying. That's why I clarified multiple times that there's a difference between the initial bill and the actual reimbursement. 

Edit: This:
&gt;They charge different priced based on who is paying, so a generic number can't be quoted. 

Was your intial statement. That's incorrect/misleading, because there is a generic/official number, it's the chargemaster price and it's what everyone initially gets charged."

medicine,"1\) Evo\-psych is a problematic field compared to the wider world of psychology research, and most other social sciences. It suffers from fundamental issues including:

* Accurate data about human behavior in pre\-modern times does not exist. It is circular reasoning to make assumptions about past behavior based on current behavior, and then explain current behavior in terms of that past assumed behavior. On its face this is an invalid research method.
* Half of the fundamental formulation of the theory of evolution is ""descent with variation"" \(the other half being ""natural selection"" of course\). Human behavior has never been shown to have modular heritability in the manner of a gene, and does not vary predictably within generations in the manner of genetics. The application of evolutionary therapy to cognitive/behavioral patterns has therefore not yet been justified.
* The field suffers greatly from unfalsifiable hypotheses \(AKA ""just so stories""\). You cannot have valid hypothesis testing if you cannot design a test that can adequately reject the null hypothesis. If your study is not powered to reject the null or the assay is inappropriate/unrelated to the hypothesis, the study is not scientific by definition.
* There are very poor publishing standards in the field \(see the ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" hoax\).

At this point, it is safe to start with the assumption that any assertion based on evo psych is bunk, and put the burden on any individual study to try and justify itself. 

&gt; It's rather hilarious that a doctor is telling me it's problematic to use one of the pillars of our field \- evolution \- in the understanding of how the human brain works and how society was derived from it.

I'm not telling you that evolution is unhelpful in understanding how the human brain works. It is a very interesting question and the notion of evo\-psych is intriguing. I am telling you that the social science of evo\-psych is not conceptually or methodologically sound, and that the body of its published literature to this point should not be taken seriously or used to draw conclusions.

2\) Feminism is not a specific field of scientific study. It is a social and political ideology that lacks a highly specific definition, but like most language, most people agree on what we mean when we say it.

3\) Where do my beliefs about equality come from? That is a longer discussion. Some of it is based on my understanding of biology and social sciences, but more of it is based on my understanding of history and my personal beliefs. The short version is that postulated biological differences in aptitude among races, genders, etc break down in the discussion of any individual person \(the variability WITHIN each group is far greater than the variability BETWEEN two groups\). Historically, people used to strongly believe in differences in aptitude between races, cultures, religions, etc. These have all proven to be invalid on closer inspection. Many times in history, a group has suffered lack of opportunities due to cultural factors. Based on this history and my own observations of the world, I have a bias that any significant, repeated difference in outcomes between groups of humans is due to cultural factors and not biology, unless strong evidence to the contrary is presented. Basically the likelihood that positions of power are overwhelmingly full of white Christian men because of innate aptitude is very, very low, and I have never seen good evidence for this superior innate aptitude."

That is bullshit propaganda used to scare people into opposing universal healthcare.

The average American actually pays more in taxes than the average Canadian.

In peds its important to be caring and supportive but not to be completely emotionally invested in a patient, as it can start to eat at your mental health. On bad days or if a patient died, I would ask myself ""Did I do everything I could for the patient"" If the answer was yes I could sleep well. If the answer was no, I would review the chart entirely, including labs and vital signs to learn what I could have done earlier, and discuss the case with the attending.

medicine,"to add another year (or more) to residency. i know this won't be a popular opinion on here, but i do think there is a difference between drs right out of training since the 80 hour rule was put into place in 2003. i personally would be fine with this, but then there would be logistical issues of coverage, which means we'd have to open up more med school slots or accept more FMGs (which would be a very good thing, but unlikely to happen).

i get that everybody feels better when well rested, but i don't think by shortening the work week, it is going to change the culture of how we treat patients any bit.

finally, there are plenty of PhD students working the same hours, or more, who publish original research, which few drs are doing, especially during residency. so, yes, memory formation may be slightly better when you sleep more, but sleeping less isn't creating noticable differences in outcomes.

I had to work twelve billion hours a week throughout my registrar years and more so in my fellow years but now I’m a boss life is so much easier. General Surgery (and it’s subspecialties) is a hard path but it is very much worth it.

medicine,"The goal of HIPAA is to protect patient's privacy.

medicine,"Everyone is still using an outdated definition of CKD from 2002. 

KDIGO refined the definition of CKD in 2013 as ""abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for &gt;3 months, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH.""

“With implications for health"" was added to the definition as implications begin at eGFR&lt;60 (increased CVD/mortality/etc).

So if someone is perfectly healthy and has a eGFR of 88 (high muscle mass/elderly/etc), they would have qualified for a diagnosis of CKD 2 under the 2002 definition, but do not qualify for a CKD diagnosis under the 2013 definition). 

However if they have a eGFR of 88, but have 100mg of albuminuria daily (structural defect of glomerulus), now they have CKD G2A2 (or A3 if albuminuria &gt;300)

The G and A categories are used to stratify risk of progression.

Another example: Someone is born with a hypoplastic kidney, but the other kidney has hypertrophied and their eGFR is 95 with no albuminuria. This patient has CKD G1A1 due to the structural defect.

The most common patient population where you will see CKD G1/2 is diabetics. They will initially hyperfiltrate, lowering serum Cr and thus raising the eGFR. This will, over time, cause glomerular injury and albuminuria - qualifying them for a diagnosis of CKD. 

The proper way to document CKD is by using the G/A categories - CKD 3 in a patient with 2g albuminuria should be written CKD G3A3. 

In reality this is rarely done but hopefully it answers your question.

medicine,"Pharmaceutical firms are less and less as the decades go by competing by way of innovation, and more and more competing on their ability to manipulate policy and its interpretations, in order to pursue a pathway to ensure their monopolies or colluded oligopolies. Patents are not inalienable rights, they are bestowed by society/government in order to grant monopolies which would encourage innovation. We the public grant them in order to benefit the public. The intent is innovation. The pendulum has been continuously swinging too far, however. Instead of research and development with scientists and statisticians, we now have loophole finder lawyers and marketers. We're now at WWI trench warfare of pharma. There's a lot of spending being done, a lot of damage being done, but no progress being made. The activities of regulatory pathway manipulations are failing to move medicine forward. It's subverting the intention of the patent system in the first place. It's blocking innovation and better drugs. The balance of public good and private incentive is now fully depressed rather than evenly weighted.  


Why do prices of drugs that are off patent, some existing on the market for decades, suddenly increase in price so much, and possibly continually doing so, when their values should be remaining stable or going down? It seems companies are taking advantage of price inelasticity. But then why aren't other competitors entering the market? They're being blocked from doing so.

&gt;Lawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QC said: “The attempt to manipulate the baby’s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix has clamped onto the baby’s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed.

&gt;“Dr Laxman made three attempts to cut the cervix with scissors but **Baby B’s head was separated from his body and his head was stuck inside Patient A’s body.**”

&gt;He added: “As a matter of compassion the head was reattached so the appearance of the baby was not too extreme. The baby was shown to his mother so she had the consolation of seeing him.”

&gt;Mr Garside added: “The choice was taken by Dr Laxman to try a vaginal delivery and this was the wrong choice. They should never use a vaginal delivery in that situation.”

OP - I recently asked a pathologist about this and she told me that the problem with scientifically proving any of this will be incredibly difficult, there are just so many variables to try to control in a diet study.

Overnight we have a fellow and a resident. The resident came to assess a patient at nursings request and he called the fellow (who was in his sleep room) to discuss his assessment and plan. 

Fellow told him to do a different plan... resident hesitated... fellow said goodnight and ended the call. 

Nursing wasn’t comfortable with the fellows plan either, so we chatted about the possible outcomes of each plan and all agreed that the residents plan was best for the patient based on our combined knowledge and the patients condition. The resident called his fellow back but the fellow was insistent on his plan, and didn’t provide any explanation why his plan would have better outcomes for the patient. Resident apologized to the fellow and told him that he couldn’t write those orders. If the fellow wanted it done, he would have to get up and write them himself. He did.

Now we have modern techniques and medications and tools, so the same patient in the same situation fast forwarded in time isn't necessarily dead. Fast forward again, and what is dead? 

It's all a bit semantic, isn't it? It's the same physiologic state considered differently based on our available tools and techniques.

Overall I agree that healthcare pricing isn't as transparent as it should be but it's honestly kind of asinine to expect price estimates over the phone as done in this study. I think a lot of doctors might rightfully choose not to provide it without a consultation. How do they know the operation is even indicated without the consultation, or what preop workup needs to be done, what surgical approach, or post-op care? Also, I worked in the office of a world reknown surgeon who did do cash patients before medical school, and it's a ton of work for office staff to put these packages together and contact hospital staff etc., and the cost of the consultation helps to defray the cost of labor on that.

If the study included a patient who went in for a consult, it would vastly improve the construct validity of the study."

medicine,"Really the biggest disconnect is that at a lot of facilities, the doctors spend all day interacting with the staff, while the administrators spend all day interacting with each other.  The doctors have no interest in more meetings, and even when they show up, most times the human connection about the needs are lost in translation or glossed over as they don’t get heard as persistently as the clinicians hear the calls of distress from the staff. 

The biggest source of burnout is the conditioning of physicians throughout the educational and training process to accept an ever increasing demand to perform work. Outside the protected educational environment, the capitation is unrestricted the physician must begin to push back against the rising tide of work through resistance, contract negotiation, and routine communication of needs for support and shifting of responsibility to additional and other staff. Physicians are never trained to do this, and early on it is a habit in direct opposition of goals to rapidly build a volume of practice and achieve desired goals of financial security and community support and demand. 

When the physician crossed the threshold of overwork, it is incumbent upon the individual to expend a great deal of effort building rapport and support in negotiations with office management,multiple levels of administration, colleagues, partners, and staff members to move the set point and define limits. This will be an exceedingly painful process, and unfortunately becomes one more of many opportunities throughout one’s career to find oneself in attrition, probably following a few earlier times such as completion of college, early medical school, early Internship, and mid residency when the modes of burnout tend to peak. 

I suggest stepping back, intentionally cutting work hours, especially volume of outpatient clinic and night call duty which will downregulate the rest of workflow. 

Focus again on personal growth and efficiency, cut out unnecessary drains on personal energy including excessive use of social and traditional media. 

Excercise every day, eat healthy, avoid excessive recreational substance abuse, schedule time off for consolidated restful leisure, read for pleasure, get out in nature, sleep adequately, and as much as is necessary, start to build a working knowledge of basic concepts of business and negotiation, most physicians neglect or willfully avert doing so to their own detriment. Learn how to calculate and understand your worth to the organization. Then scale back up your practice with adequate staffing and efficiency having laid the necessary groundwork. 

If you do these things, you can recover from burnout and have a better work schedule and home life without sacrificing the reimbursement you have worked so diligently to deserve. The administrators will then at first resent your assertiveness, but will further respect your value as you help them to understand as well.

medicine,"I'm curious how it would work to include a waiver in new patient documents that would allow a physician or their staff to respond to a review online with some revelant material that would ordinarily violate HIPAA. 

Sort of like a disclosure that I would sign that would allow my physician to tell a significant other health information but for online reviews. 

Say John comes to my practice with a HSV-1 and request that I give him antibiotics to make the cold sores go away. I explain to him but I can't do that because it won't work but then John goes online and says that I am completely incompetent and wouldn't give him the medication that would help him because x. 

Normally I wouldn't be able to respond in any meaningful way because I can't give any health information that would violate HIPAA. 

But if they signed a HIPAA waiver that would allow me to respond to online reviews specifically with something like ""Dear John I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you but as I explained in the office, antibiotics would not work against a viral infection.""

If military vets in the unnamed country in question have unlimited, no-questions-asked coverage, including $850 specialty blood tests inconsistent with any symptoms or any other diagnostics or treatment, that coverage is almost certainly very widely abused, with high-taxpaying citizens like OP being defrauded out of their hard-earned money every day.

medicine,"While I agree with the article that personal attention and empathy from doctors improves patient outcomes, I don't think there is a simple fix. We have continued to teach medical students to be dispassionate and avoid getting close to patients. I don't know why. If I take my dog to the vet, the vet fawns over my dog. In medicine, the empathy has been beaten out of most students by the end of MS3. It doesn't get better as students, who become residents, who then become attendings, get more and more jaded, and unfortunately, the entire system--and their peers--support and commiserate in their hasty attitude.

I think it varies on the diagnosis. If it is clear that there is less than a few months left, the physician I work with generally lets the patient know that they should get their affairs in order. If the patient has several lines of therapy available to them, usually the prognosis isn’t very clear and my physician emphasizes that. 

What I have noticed, though, is it’s very difficult to estimate anything with the variations of chemo/immuno/targeted therapies for several types of cancer. There’s a patient we see who has stage IV pancreatic cancer and has survived almost 4 years from their diagnosis. 

Usually, what happens in most cases is the doc will give an estimate of their lifespan without any sort of therapy. That’s much easier to determine. "

medicine,"This is an interesting response. Did you read all of my posts, or did you stop at the word douche and just skipped ahead to come down and trash all lawyers?

What I said is that the doctor was within his right to bring this suit. It probably is a case of libel. 

But if this guy has lost a sizable chunk of his business, it is solely a result of THIS SUIT. He had a number of one-star reviews on ZocDoc before this, but he’s put himself on the map with this lawsuit. Further, he probably has seen an increase in his malpractice insurance, but only because insurance companies understand that providers who sue their own patients are more likely to get more than their fair share of board complaints. This guy has taken a large-caliber gun out and shot himself right in the foot. 

His patient took the review down. But that wasn’t enough. From a risk-management perspective, this law suit was I’ll-advised.

medicine,"Strange enough, in general I have found that the more experienced the nurse, the more nuanced they are about what they object to and how.   I have found nurses immensely invaluable to my internship year. Absolutely invaluable. I can't stress that enough. But there's always the occasional nurse that makes my job unnecessarily difficult. It's not that I want the orders written followed without questions. I am nowhere knowledgeable enough to consider myself or my team infallible. What I find challenging is have to deal with issues that were raised that I listened to, carefully considered first by me, then I brought up and discussed multiple times with my senior residents/fellows and attending, before writing the orders decided by the team. Yet, there's a nurse giving me flack about it all day.   On most days, I am happy to take the time to explain if you're willing to listen, how and why a particular objection is not tenable/relevant in that particular patient's situation. Some days, I am just too busy to do that until much later. In my limited experience, the root cause of this disconnect is often 2-fold, the first is often because nurses often are not privy to the decision-making discussions about patient-specific subtleties that justify the deviation from the typical treatment plan. Does this new intern, doing something than what we usually do, know what he is doing?  Secondly, nurses and doctors perform complimentary roles in patient care, but their training and workflow exposes to them different aspects of patient care. Nurses often are closer to patients and more in tune with the patients concerns which may or may not coincide with the patients actual medical issues. 

 I will give an example. I had a mid 30s patient who swallowed a foreign object but is concerned about constipation, but as surgeons we are more concerned about potential bowel perforation. Once we saw the object made it to the large bowel, we felt we were in the clear. There's no longer anything medically emergent about her care at this point. but the patient was still hyper anxious about her constipation, and her nurse had becomes so too. We didn't admit this woman to the surgical service to fix her constipation (we can give you stuff for that do at home yourself, and you can follow up with GI if you want to work-up dysmotility issues). We admitted her to follow her because of the potential of needing emergent surgery if she perfed her small bowels. To the nurse and patient concerned about constipation, our plans will always seem bizarre and not in the patient's interest, especially since we were ready to discharge once the object had safely made it to the large bowel, but she still had not pooped. I did acquiesce to that particular nurse's demands (""concerns""), and kept the patient a day and half more doing absolutely nothing for her other than wait. And of course she pooped the said object as I had told them she inevitably will whether she's at home, in the hospital or in outer space. Then as soon as she does, I get multiple repeat stat pages from the same nurse demanding discharge paperwork for the patient stat. First you fight me over a discharge, delay it 2 days, but want me to leave everything and attend to it stat once you've decided the patient is ready to discharge. "

&gt; 
&gt; The movement caused the infant’s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother’s womb.
&gt; 
&gt; Two other doctors consequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant’s head. It was ‘’reattached’’ to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.

medicine," Both roads but in the legal market. I was a partner at two small firms that hired marketers, paid tens of thousands for ridiculous advertising, etc despite my objections. But I was outvoted. It was a total waste of money. We maybe broke even but in the service industry, that essentially means you are working for free and I value my time. I ended up going solo and outperforming both firms in six months without a dime on marketing beyond $500 for three years of web hosting and a domain.

An employee we had at one of the firm was absolutely fantastic at marketing, extremely personable, and self motivated. Unfortunately I was the only one that appreciated her skill set. Ironically she ended up working for an MD that decided to start her own practice, and no surprise for me, that MD did very well within a year in large part to my former employees marketing efforts.  But there are a ton of eager young educated people that can't get an opportunity to thrive.  I'd hire her in a second but I've got more business than I can handle and am winding down so I can leave the state. 

I do all of my marketing myself and ""somehow"" managed to out compete the professional marketers. My significant other is an MD studying for the USMLE and from my perspective, it seems like a cakewalk to market for physician services compared to legal services, which is obnoxiously competitive. It largely depends on how you get patients though. If most of your business comes from referrals, it makes no sense to hire a marketing firm. If you are going direct to consumer and have other physicians under your employ, it makes more sense to invest in a good employee to do your marketing for you.  You'd get 2,000 hours of someone dedicated to your success for 30\-40k versus a marketing firm that will spend maybe 50 hours and charge you the same amount. It's a no brainer. The degree doesn't matter so much as someone that's motivated and intelligent. 

If you don't mind sharing some details on your target audience, I'm happy to share my input.  Like if 90&amp;#37; of your practice area comes from referrals, don't waste money on advertising. The service industry whether legal or medical has the same fundamentals. Referrals are the best kind of business to get since it's essentially free business. "

medicine,"&gt; What do you guys do with these types of patients to get through with them and see change?


Yes it's our job to help people, but they're also adults with independent free will.  Making healthy lifestyle changes is a choice, and they are allowed to choose not to want to.  I know it doesn't make sense to you, but it's not your life and it's not your call.  If you've provided all of the relevant information for the patient to make their decision and used all of the typical strategies to encourage them, it is ultimately still their decision.  Some people (many, honestly) would rather die from their diabetes than change their whole life.  In this scenario I think the ethical approach is to minimize the harm their lifestyle is causing.  If you want an analogy, look at end of life care in terminal cancer.  We routinely accept as valid the patient choice to reject life prolonging treatments in lieu of enjoying their short time left to the maximum.  This is the same idea but on a slightly longer time scale.  Some people would rather eat ice cream and live a shorter life than give it up and add a few years.  "
medicine,"Oh sure it’s intimidating! But back when I was a lab rat seeking clearance to work on the Antrax case the FBI showed up *at my mother’s house* and asked her questions about my integrity, etc. There was something about their questions that she found weird (something about whether I was “proud to be an American”) and her internal alarm went off and she (I’m literally quoting) told them to “fuck off unless you’re willing to tell me why you’re here.” I ended up having to sheepishly tell her that she needed to answer their questions or else I’d be fired. At the time I was horrified. Now, I’m quite proud. They went back and she complied. It was a turning point for me as a young adult; I realized I could negotiate with others who have more power than me.

Mom was a PT but now that she’s older she’s an activity therapist. She teaches Anger Management at an inpatient mental hospital in Detroit for people who are deemed incompetent to stand trial. She has lots of funny patient stories that I hear many years after the fact. Mostly, though, she just wants to see people get better so she buys them soap in the shape of an angel if they are religiously preoccupied to help them shower or trinkets from Amazon if they attend her classes.

And either way, it seems like saving the wasted resources and diagnostics spent on addicts in the ED would justify the expense.

medicine,"I normally write about general ideas and news in medical AI, but this post is specifically to show one rarely talked about way to use AI for medical researchers. If you use medical images, you will have faced a lot of silly problems when you wanted to make your datasets. There are a whole bunch of reasons that some images you have extracted don't look like the images you want in your data, but you have no way to identify them without looking at every case manually.

Things like:

* some images are rotated
* some images are flipped
* some images have inverted pixel values
* some images are taken differently, like expiratory chest xrays
* some images have a poor signal to noise ratio
* some images are post-treatment (with implanted metal, chest drains etc)
* some studies contain multiple images, when you only want one
* some patients have variant anatomy
* studies have a different phase of contrast, or a different cellular stain

and so on.

In this post I try to show that if you have a visual problem that is *simple* to solve for a human but time-consuming, then maybe you should use deep learning. There problems are easy to learn for these systems, and most of these challenges can be solved with minimal effort. For example; in this post in under 4 hours I excluded ~420 images from a dataset of 120,000 chest x-rays, containing multiple different problems... imagine looking through 120,000 x-rays, possibly multiple times, to find them by hand."

So far FDA has not found evidence that plastic might culpable and unless a regulatory agency or a federal court ordered review shows proof these lawsuits should be dismissed as a class action.


"
medicine,"Yeah, so, as I said: not a lawyer. My read is this: law enforcement has a lot of ways to GET your records. But to proactively GIVE UP a patient presence in the ER, well, there’s no statutory safe harbor for that, and if nothing else you put yourself at risk of civil tort if you violate privacy by doing so. Never been litigated AFAIK so this may be unresolved under current law. Note the distinction there: health care providers usually have to comply w a legit demand for info from law enforcement. But if we drop a dime on a patient, not sure there is protection for us. 

In my state patient privacy protections are pretty strong and I would be *very* cautious about breaching the veil in the absence of a reportable condition (certain infectious diseases, GSW, suspected child abuse, etc). Other states may differ. And of course then there are a million regulations (joint commission and the like) plus your hospital’s risk management policies which may not get you put in jail but might lose you your job. "

medicine,"Especially since you are a medical professional, you should learn the difference between CVS and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. CVS is not caused by cannabis, though many CVS sufferers medicate and find significant relief from cannabis. A true CVS sufferer might not get significant relief from a shower, though if you think about it, when you have a disorder that makes you puke 10 or 20 times per hour (not per day, that's every hour), you can get covered in puke and sweat, thus necessitating more frequent showers. I would argue that frequent showering is weak, circumstantial evidence of CHS at best and doesn't indicate or rule out CVS at all. You'd be much better served by asking the patient if the vomiting started before cannabis use, or if they are using cannabis in response to the vomiting. If the vomiting started first, then it's CVS or something else. If the cannabis use started first, then you *might* have a CHS sufferer, but you still need to rule out other causes like gastroparesis, food poisoning, etc. In any case blending CHS and CVS together is both incorrect and extremely harmful to patients. People with CVS often go years without proper treatment and get painted by professionals as hypochondriacs and drug addicts, leading them to distrust the only people who can help them manage what is truly a severe and life threatening disorder."

medicine,"Feel free to search the subreddit for previous meta/moderation posts which we try to run two or three times a year for discussion about why we do this. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/406efm/meta_rmedicine_mods_would_like_your_opinions_on/cys0hxt/) is a simple example. In essence, simply compare /r/health to /r/medicine. They are comparable in size (/r/health having about 280,000 subscribers), but /r/health is relatively unmoderated and /r/medicine is heavily moderated and I think you can see that the general subreddit content and discussion is significantly different as a result of this. 31 of their current top 50 front page currently consists of posts left with minimal engagement and &lt;5 comments whereas that is only the case with two of our current top 50, and the selection of sources is (in my opinion) far more interesting and reputable on /r/medicine - partly, I believe, because contributors must identify their role and have a minimum vested interest in making a post and seeing it succeed in the subreddit.

It takes about sixty seconds to write a starter comment and this cuts down heavily on people spamming links to multiple medicine-related subreddits, and ensures that the person submitting the article has at least read the article and is coherent enough to form a comment about it (ie not a bot). It makes our lives as moderators much easier and in most cases stimulates discussion as a conversation is ready to be started immediately on submission - and this subreddit thrives on its multidisciplinary international medical discussion.

Sure, sometimes the starter comment flops, but that's usually on the quality of the comment or the content and not, in my opinion, a reflection of the value of the rule."

medicine,"It’s a confirmation test for band 41, that specifically links it to borrelia, if you didn’t know. Band 41 cross reacts with leptospirosis, and syphilis flagellin. So no, the other tests do not specify which flagellin polypeptide it is. That’s why. Many doctors that have analyzed it before me have exclaimed that this is true. If I even care to throw the study in your face, it’s a 95% sensitive test that was faced against serum positive participants. This patent is ready to go yet it’s not being used. And sooner or later the people involved are going to be sued. Why yale make the best testing method yet lymerix did not use it and use an obviously shittier one. You can’t have a confirmed band 41 using that test without an active borrelia infection.

This situation is actually being discussed in the new working group for the new Lyme disease vaccine they’re working up.

The immunosuppressant situation is also being discussed in that working group.

If you watch their meetings you can see what I’m talking about.

They also talk about have antigenic variation will question the validity of a vaccine.

They also talk about the major failures of the lymerix vaccine and the class action lawsuit.

My execution isn’t the best but there’s many that believe the situation that are at a much more intelligent level. And many have experienced situations like this before.

The NIH will not fund any new lyme vaccine endeavors, by the way. Because of the new information coming forward

This whole testing criteria malfunction situation has already happened with AIDS. If you think I’m being a conspiracy theorist. Which I’m not.

So call me bias and a lost cause all you want but I believe you may be bias as well.

I’m done too.

Maybe in 5 years I’ll post a link of those men going to jail, or better yet, more accurate testing criteria to help thousands.

medicine,"You mean how I see how much a drug costs wholesale, how much insurance pays for a medication (often not at all, the PBM just sets a higher copay for a patient than the cash price), how most patients would be better off not having drug coverage at all and paying out of pocket, how they promote narrow networks and mail order pharmacies in which patients get worse care resulting in far more health costs for the public, etc. etc. I see the money flow every day on this level and it is not working. At all. The PBMs are costing our healthcare system, not saving it. Providers need to contract directly with insurance companies, or even better a publicly owned non-profit entity in which all risk is pooled. The system is a mess and PBMs are the biggest example of that. "

People with severe symptoms prioritize them. They will do the things necessary to improve their symptoms.

medicine,"&gt; but no one ever cares how these proffesionals feel when lawyers, patients and whatever other person dares to think they know something about medicine or biology and try to discuss medical criteria for X o Y procedure or even worse, demand it.

I've rarely, if ever, seen other professionals insinuate they know enough to give medical advice. I've worked as an expert witness for ten cases in the last two years, and lawyers are EXTREMELY careful not to imply that they understand medical quandaries because that's a great way to completely throw out your case and be liable for obscene fees.

This sounds like your own frustrations with your personal system than it is an endemic issue. I don't think you understand.

&gt; It's good more health practitioneers are up to defending their rights as persons

Come on dude. Doctors aren't a persecuted class, and bad on-line reviews hardly implies a ""muh rights are being trampled"" defense. If there's an actual issue with this patient then sure, let's make it so that people are more informed about the care they receive so they're liable for reviews that don't reflect the service - but couching it in ""defending their rights"" is kind of hilariously over-the-top of a reaction."

medicine,"Fair to remember the difference between PBMs and payers - though with all the integration going on in the space, those differences are blurring.

As a broad trend, I'd argue PBMs have been passing less and less of the savings on to beneficiaries over the past few years. We can already see the winds of change on this, though - several PBMs have already begun talking about passing rebates on to individual patients instead of the plan.

I'd agree with you oncology is a bit of a different beast. But here we have a couple of interesting natural experiments unfolding. I'll be very curious to see how pricing in growingly crowded spaces like anti-PD1 (assuming we don't see a truly differentiated product emerge - not a guarantee, based on recent trials). From what we know about generics, it usually takes three manufacturers to enter the space before prices start to drop dramatically.

medicine,"A well known study actually associated higher patient satisfaction with increased costs and markedly increased mortality. Here is a discussion of the study with its author: https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/826280 who concludes that patient satisfaction is related to patient expectations of care and likely has nothing to do with quality of care since in many cases the patient has very little knowledge or understanding of what high quality care entails. 

Notably in many cases no intervention is the best course, however in our country first of all we have been conditioned to view health care as transactional, so patients expect to “get something” finite in return for what they’ve paid. Second we have been conditioned to view health as largely a series of reactive interventions to “fix” various problems that arise, whereas in reality the best way to address illness is always to prevent rather than to treat. 

For me the transactional nature of medicine is a huge problem. Patients are not customers, good patient care does not equal good customer service, it is possible to be ethical and not paternalistic in one’s medical practice without always satisfying patients. Patients are not customers, and treating them as customers is a fundamental error that leads to many problems (I could list about 10 problematic implications of treating patients as customers)."

medicine,"Yes and no. If you haul off and hit a cop no one would be surprised to see you at the very least struck, taken down, tased, or if the size discrepancy was high enough even shot. I have personally seen three nurses violently attacked (not counting psychiatric patients which I think is a different discussion) and not once have charges been filed by the administration even when requested by nurses. Much less would the nurse have been supported if she struck the patient back. 

We have all seen videos of police officers arresting somebody for verbally abusing them, whether that is right or wrong it’s still light years ahead of the absolutely nothing that happens to patients when they verbally assault staff."

Those that you mentioned \(public research investment, infrastructure, necessary non\-profit systems, etc\) frequently fall into the category of a public good, the need for which by definition is not properly met by the private market. Additionally, I also agree the state is necessary to protect labor from capital, as the power amassed by capital often can lead to an imbalance between capital and labor, which threatens the stability of the entire system.

medicine,"&gt; Alder Hey's proposed treatment for this child's irreversible condition 

That's part of the problem. They didn't propose any treatment, because his condition had none. What the hospital proposed with a withdrawal of active treatment and a shift to palliation. Even the Italian hospital \(Bambino Gesu\) stated that all they would have done was a trach/PEG.

The child had no quality of life \-\- ongoing seizures, a largely non\-functional cerebrum. I appreciate that our views often differ from our patients and their families, but the family in this situation had a grossly distorted view of their son's abilities \-\- seeing him as neurologically responsive when even their experts agreed with Alder Hey that he wasn't.

So why should the parents get a say, when they can't even look objectively at what's happening? The only rationale is, ""They're his parents."" And in the UK, that isn't enough."

How'd it get to be this way?

medicine,"Trick question. Most of them are malingering. \(I have a biased patient sample, obviously.\)

A similar argument could be made for other chronic conditions. Your third episode of DKA and you don't get an insulin drip? After your first CHF exacerbation with med nonadherence you're on your own? That seems heartless and crazy. So as you say, it's strange to put a special onus on drug users.

But the frustration with drug use is real and difficult."
medicine,"&gt; That's not a terribly meaningful metric, it doesn't control for scale.

Because scale doesn't matter. You said we have global peace. There are many metrics one can use to prove that's not true.

&gt;The sheer size of Uncle Sam makes militarism in other countries unfeasible.

Militarism on a massive scale is unfeasable because of the nuclear tonnage floating over everyone's heads. We have the capacity to erase nations from the face of the earth, every conflict beneath that is dick waving, at the cost of the lives of young people, mostly directed at countries without a real capacity to defend themselves.

&gt;Wars are primarily between near-peers. When nobody can match The Big Iron, no war. That's the thinking the past few decades at least.

That's a convenient sounding justification, but it's post hoc ergo propter hoc. I could name a dozen other contributing factors, including a generalized global anti-war sentiment, international trade, nuclear weapons, etc etc, but I'm not educated enough to say definitively what the primary factor would be, and I'm disinclined to believe you are, given you're a medical student and not a PHD in international politics.

&gt;This doesn't have to be zero sum. I'm in support of far greater taxes to pay for education. Get yourself a government that can do both.

I agree, but then it's misleading in your original post to say ""the military is useful, look at how much we spend on education and healthcare!"" Distracting from one problem by pointing at another doesn't mean the first problem doesn't exist.

&gt;We live in a world where we can treasure these things because we've established security. Without security and a unipolar world, we go back to the 1900s. Frankly, fuck that.

I've never understood how people make this jump.

As a society, America continues to progress. We don't lynch black people or beat gay people as often as we used to, we're making a lot of money, and our level of convenience and interconnectedness have never been greater. Instead of saying that we have these things because we've stopped killing eachother, how about the suggestion that we've stopped killing eachother because we have nice things?

&gt;It's not terribly charitable to imply that agreeing with conservatives makes you uneducated

I'm not. I'm implying that spitting back talking points designed to gain political capital doesn't make a person educated.

2. Sodium deficit = Total body water * (desired Na - pt's Na) (TBW = 0.6 if male and 0.5 if female)
e.g. 100 kg adult male with Na 110: TBW = 60 L, sodium deficit = 60 * (125-110) = 900 mEq
3. Correction rate: 1L of NS has 154 mEq Na. 1500 mEq deficit is 5.8 L of NS. Correcting by 8 mEq/day means you will need about 72 hours, or 5800 mL/72 h = 81 mL/h. Make sure to check sodium frequently, such as every 3 hours initially, to make sure the trajectory is correct - you can always change to D5W if you are over-correcting!

medicine,"I take issue with the fact that we keep referring to them as “insurance companies”. They aren’t faceless machines. They are PEOPLE and these PEOPLE are killing other people with unjustified denials, delays caused by prior authorizations and in general, making physicians jump through 5-10 hoops to get proper care for their patients.   
The PEOPLE who work at insurance companies are emboldened by anonymity. These people deny life saving cancer treatments because they are not publicly identified. Think about it, we always say “insurance won’t pay for this, insurance won’t cover that, insurance wants a prior authorization (and this stupidly may take 1-2 DAYS)”. No one really bothers with the PUBLICIZING THE NAME of the person who is  making these denials (and potentially killing a someone’s child or parent by using these insidious cost cutting insurance schemes)

Their names should be publicly outed, every single time. Then these employees will be more careful about adding so much unnecessary misery to patient and doctors lives if their names are PUBLICIZED. I would be pretty pissed at my “Uncle Joe” if I found out he made the process of getting medical care really difficult for a sick and vulnerable patient... for a paycheck.
Personally I know that these animals have purposely refused to cover hospitalizations and medications just to make the process as difficult as possible for patients and their doctors. Oh and they KNOW that the insurance claim is justified and they KNOW that they will eventually have to pay on appeal  but they are purposely difficult hoping that we we give up on requesting reimbursement. And Uncle Joe is a DICK for doing that to us. "

Why might an organization be reticent about their average charges? Because say Insurer A pays $x for a procedure... and Insurer B pays 1.5*$x. Maybe publishing an average charge of 1.25*$x makes sense... until Insurer B finds that published price and realizes it could get away with charging 1.25*$x... or 1*$x... or 0.75*$x.

It is not unheard of to require fairly intense psychiatric monitoring of the physician as a condition of licensing which can place quite a burden on the physician, their care providers, and in the case of trainees, their programs.

However, it is additional stress during what should be a very celebratory time, and I’m being put in the position of feeling pushed into a corner of needing to explain things which really they should have no need to know. 

If I had known it was likely that this would happen, I’d quite likely not have gone to medical school in the first place. I don’t particularly feel like justifying why I’m not damaged goods just because I’ve needed medical treatment. I am stronger for it. 

If they refuse my license, I will appeal. I do not yet know what form that will take, but I’m certainly not the type to go down without a fight if it comes to that. "

medicine,"When admins (clinical or ""MBA trained"") are doing their job well, most people don't notice because things just work. Don't be fooled though, that actually takes a lot of work. What that means though, is that you tend to only notice when things go wrong (which is going to happen in any system as complex as a hospital) and so the encounters that front line staff talk aren't necessarily representative of what goes on behind the scenes. As to customer service scores, we know they're BS but they're tied to revenue, so we don't have a choice. It's a difficult position to be in, because the only people who can really affect the scores are the clincal staff and yet you guys aren't generally the ones who have to deal with detailed financials/budget decisions (understandably, that's not your job) so you don't necessarily see the full impact those scores can have on the ability of the hospital to provide the staff and resources you need to provide care. 

When it comes to conflict between the staff and admin, another really common scenario is that we end up bearing the brunt of the conflict between clinicians/clinical areas (which again, is okay, that's part of our job). Someone else in the thread mentioned hallway patients in inpatient areas. From the perspective of staff on the floor, that can look like admins not caring about the clinical risks involved with that, but the reality is that sometimes it's the least bad short term option we have in a system that's strapped for resources. 

Another example that I deal with frequently is balancing the role of the ED and their ability to control their spaces with the requests of specialists who want things done a certain way when they come to the ED to consult. I have an ENT doctor who will happily tell everyone that I'm the devil incarnate because I won't take an ED room and kit it out as an ENT room, but in a space limited area, having a dedicated room that might get used once or twice a week at best is not a good decision, from a business *or* a clinical perspective (because it reduces the usefulness of that room for regular ED patients). 

Obviously these are simple examples, but I hope they illustrate my point that you're almost certainly getting a one sided view of situations when you're talking to your colleagues. There *are* terrible admins, but most of us really do care about the patients and we're just doing the best we have with a broken healthcare system and limited resources. If we didn't, we'd go work in another industry where we get paid more and don't get blamed for everything that's wrong in modern medicine. "

We also had a patient recently with a femoral fracture. After surgery, a hip fracture could be seen on the postop RX as well (it wasn‘t there before). Well, COULD have been seen I should say since no one actually saw it until the patient got back from rehab... ^^ At least there was something to learn from those pictures and the patient couldn‘t be blamed or anything.

A lot of stuff gets put off until day shift because the nocs don't know the patients at all.

medicine,"&gt;Pharma companies say that money spent on promotion is essential to educate doctors about the best drugs - but when a medical student asked Joseph Ross, associate professor of medicine and public health at Yale, if those companies are promoting the right drugs for that message to be true, the answer wasn't available. Ross and Tyler Greenaway, his medical student, then sat down and used the data from the US Physician Payments Sunshine Act to find out which drugs have the highest promotional budgets. They cross referenced that against prescription databases and measures of value to assess the effectiveness, usefulness, and affordability of the drugs that get the heaviest promotion. http://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j1855

So what we have evidence here is counter to what so many defending the sheisty practice claim. Reps are not giving good information. They are not likely as a whole selling the best drugs. Valuable drugs. Effective drugs. They are likely, which as a whole has been found, to be selling ""mee too"" drugs establishing and gaining market share. The top promoted drugs were much less likely to have qualities of high value drug. Top promoted drugs were providing less value to patients. They were the new drugs. The expensive drugs, or drugs in a crowded field.

medicine,"Medicine will change, in every way, as it always has. But you’re not wrong to suggest the plight of the physician will remain the same: that’s because the definition of “Medicine” itself is also changing. 

Medicine ought to arise from the very specific relationship of doctor to patient. The problem though is equally simple: it never was defined as such. Physicians dictated what medicine was for generations...period. The patient was there as much as the skeleton model and the cabinet with murky jars. 

Medicine has now become MedCorp. We know all the players involved: Big Pharma, Big Data, hospital operators, etc. But what seals the deal: sellout docs who don’t give a fuck about patient care and who become facilitators for these groups. 

If you work in hospitals, you see the changes right in front of your face: the government decrees everything goes electronic, leading to billion-dollar fortunes in reverse-engineering barcode readers into EHRs. The software systems intentionally fail to interface—or, at least fail to do so economically.  

The stimulus for the government’s intrusion is claimed to be the need to improve “Medicine”, but it’s complicit in the creation of MedCorp. It couldn’t care less about quality and frankly it wouldn’t even be able to define the term, much less mandate it. Government wants to: 1) spend less money on things it has to do, 2) redefine what it has to do to be less and less, and 3) create soft landing pads when its regulators cut their retirement cakes at age 55 and look for their Phase II career. 

If all physicians strived to finally shore up the doctor:patient relationship, there might be a chance to right the ship. But it will NEVER happen. 

There are simply too many physicians who consider alliances with MedCorp to be so much better for themselves than trying to be what seems like the solitary voice for change with which we all seem to identify these days. 

It's very clear to me that after nearly thirty years of practicing medicine, I'll eventually retire as a clinician, It'd be nice on some levels to be a CMO or pharma consultant...but it would require me to forsake nearly every instinct I have acquired all these years. 

I've paid dearly for trying to improve systems designed to need perpetual improvement because it's good business for the nanosecond of the now. I simply couldn't see how truly black and white things have become.

I'm just another NPI number among millions but I think we should stop asking how we fix medicine. There's a trillion dollars being spent to ensure it never happens. 

Let's instead define our terminology. If we can ever come to a consensus, purely between doctors and patients, that it's all about this sacred bond, in this nanosecond and every one to follow, we might have a chance. "

Stroke. 2009;40:2276-2293. 

This is titled Definition and Evaluation of Transient Ischemic Attack.

When I was a student (and actually when I was a neurology resident), we had a definition based on time: if it was less than 24h, it was TIA. If it was 7d or more, it was a stroke. If it was 1-6 days, it was a RIND. Anyone remember those? They fell out of favor.

Now, the definition is: if it made a mark on diffusion, then it's stroke. Typically TIA symptoms last a lot less than 24h, and I think it's still fair to say that TIA doesn't last MORE than 24h. But just because it lasts less than that time doesn't mean you can call it a TIA. For some strokes, symptoms abate really quickly. 

You can see how the evolution of definition over time  has caused a LOT of inconsistency of use. There are still docs on faculty at med schools teaching new docs the old definition. It bugs me, because it's a simple and elegant and useful definition. But there you have it.

Now we play the waiting game – this is not often shown on TV – but it was probably 2 hours from the initial call before our first patients arrived, which is hard going when you have been up now for 20 hours straight. One thing we Brits, and the NHS in particular, are good at though is brewing up – this calls for my stash of Yorkshire Teabags.

The rest of the night is something of a blur. My role dictated that I was performing command and control, so had no direct patient interaction, but liaised closely with my teams to ensure the right people were in the right place and working closely with the Trust COO \(who came in despite not being on call, and was phenomenal at getting everyone organised – for which he has gained my everlasting respect, even when he subsequently named A&amp;E decision to admit time as the single thing across the whole trust he would improve if he had the power – yeesh!!!\).

What I do remember is how well everyone involved pulled together, but a few stand out. The orthopaedic consultant, who has something of a reputation for being, well an orthopod, probably saw every patient who came \(18 in total – most with significant limb trauma\) and remained upbeat and positive throughout, even taking the time to teach our FY1 about secondary complications of trauma. The cardiology consultant who discharged a whole 14\-bed ward of patients home at midnight, whilst grumbling about his colleagues’ inability to make discharge decisions. The chaplain, who not only supported grieving families, but also helped staff do mini\-debriefs to aid their mental wellbeing \(she also found a load of biscuits in the chapel which gave a major boost to morale!\).

Overall, we got off pretty light – hearing stories from colleagues working at the Children’s hospital in particular would give anyone sleepless nights. But I’ve said it before – I truly believe every single person injured in the bombing received world\-class care, from the combined efforts of the emergency services, A&amp;E, specialty teams, all the way through to the physio/OT and psychology services who continue to work to support the victims."
medicine,"I disagree. I scrub on most cases even though I have confidence in our residents. If I'm there to teach, I figure it's better to be right there than off somewhere while the resident struggles.

I mean, the resident could work for 30 minutes and figure out what needs to be done through trial-and-error, or I can point out what they're doing wrong in 2 minutes and we can all get on with our lives."

medicine,"Multifactorial. 

1.	The dosing is fiddly. Since you can use it as an infusion or as a bolus, and the effective range for mild analgesia/opioid potentiation goes from about 4mg/hr to 20+mg *per kg* per hour for salvage bronchodilation, and you can give it as a lozenge or IM... The result is that eventually, some poor sod gives an intubating dose which gives annoying textbook hypersalivation and hypertension when they were trying to make someone tolerate a head CT. Their n=1 becomes influential. 
2.	There's a lag both into nursing practice and a much longer one out of nursing practice. This produces friction both times.
3.	For the vast majority of circumstances, there's an alternative. 
4.	There'll be a bunch of patients who entirely fairly absolutely hate it.
5.	It has considerable abuse potential.
6.	People therefore get a bit underwhelmed by its upside. 


I mean, why fight for getting ketamine infusions accepted on the ward when you can fight for dexmedetomidine, or lignocaine? Why make people use ketamine when they're perfectly hsppy with propofol+metaraminol-to-taste?

medicine,"There's that, but there's also the patient who comes in with delirium and an AKI because of a UTI. Not every infection produces a ""deregulated immune response"" so therefore its meaningful to distinguish sepsis from infection without sepsis. Sometimes it's eazy- intra-abdominal catastrophies and bacteremia virtually always make you septic. Other times, the cellulitis makes the diabetic delirious, leading to missed insulin, leading to DKA, and the combined physiologic mayhem gives them an NSTEMI. I've found that scenario more common than the catastrophies. Calling it sepsis gives it a more urgent labeling, which I think is necessary. You are communicating to people that THIS particular pneumonia is turning out to be very dangerous for this patient. "

medicine,"I work as a humanitarian aid worker in the middle east. In general you have two models: the MSF model, where they will send people to do actual implementation (working in the clinics). Usually they are sent on three month missions, and it is most useful in acute emergencies where a natural disaster occurs or war breaks out. By sending their own doctors they can respond quickly, and since MSF is not funded by aid organizations they do not have to wait for donor funding or make proposals for grants.

For protracted conflicts most healthcare will be provided by medical NGOs who are funded primarily by US and EU donors. This would be frontline trauma units, PHCs in a refugee camp, hospitals, and so on. In these cases mostly the clinic is staffed by local doctors from Iraq or Syria or the local country, and the project is managed by a foreign person who may be a medical doctor or have an MPH, but the foreigner does not actually do any practice themselves."

medicine,"Thank youl! You're right. I'll leave the case studies to the pros. "
medicine,"Is there a reason you want to publish these cases online? If you're just doing this to reflect on patient cases, why not just write for your own sake?

To be frank, unless you are seeing truly unusual and exciting cases that pique the interest of the general public (e.g. Oliver Sacks) or you have some sort of unique background that directly impacts your patient care (e.g. practicing in a third world country) , very few people are going to read your blog. But all you need is one unhappy patient or administrator to find it and create a problem (probably a minor problem, but a problem still). 

People here are recommending changing key patient identifiers, mixing and matching patient cases to make your work ""safe"". To me, that defeats the purpose of this exercise. Your writing will no longer be about truly reflecting about your patients and your work and will turn into a puzzle game. Your observations may also be more honest if you know there is no expectation to please an audience.

I recommend you just write about your patients as they are and as you want to. Do it once a week. Keep the writing to yourself. Assume it will never go beyond your desk. "

medicine,"I highly recommend asking the physicians who took over the care of the patients you admitted for pointed feedback.   The one time we didn't renew someone's contract they were simply not doing good assessments, placing all the orders they should be or documenting anything useful or close to reality.  They also didn't make any improvements after several attempts at feedback.   If your colleagues are having problems with your work, you need to know and you need to adapt based on the feedback.   Otherwise, you will have similar problems elsewhere.   

Ideally if there were problems, someone should have been communicating this to you so you could adjust before it came to this.   Some managers just suck.   Perhaps you didn't recognize the advice?

That is the reason that some patients prefer alternative health providers.  Those quacks can always produce an ""answer"" for their symptoms, such as vitamin deficiency, spinal misalignment, or chronic Lyme disease.  Patients love to have a tidy answer for their symptoms, even if there is no curative treatment.  Allopathic medicine admits that we don't know the cause of every symptom and this frustrates patients; we get accused with treating symptoms instead of treating the source of the symptoms, despite the fact that we have incomplete knowledge.

In general, people prefer confidence rather than truth.  This explains why ""alternative"" practitioners will always have customers."

medicine,"I can’t speak to your individual situation, but that surgeon and/or his group probably developed a risk/benefit framework based on experience. Maybe the risks of a third valve surgery in a patient who has already demonstrated that they can’t stop using outweigh the potential benefit based on the cases they have done in the population they serve.

I don’t think resource allocation is the main driver; distributive justice is just one of the ethical principles that need to be considered in medical ethics, and it’s one that people are much less comfortable with than, say, autonomy or beneficence. 

I guess my main framework to think about these cases is this: the intervention is very high-risk, and the likelihood of long-term success decreases each time due to likelihood of post-op complications and a demonstrated inability to quit using. 

The odds of a good outcome should be considered in surgical (and non-surgical) treatment, right? We usually don’t (or should not) offer a surgical procedure to someone if the risks outweigh the potential benefits and the likelihood of a good, durable outcome is low.  Your point about using tons of resources on people at the end of life is well-taken, and I agree that it’s probably not the most ethical treatment in many cases. That’s a problem with the America healthcare system in general."

medicine,"&gt; But instead of saying this (*author means rationing care here*) and allowing the child to go to Italy for care if paid for by private means, the NHS committed a grievous sin — it argued that the court had the right to decide that it is better for the child to die than live, justifying it on the same legal grounds used to take children away from abusive parents. This is state overreach and medical arrogance of the worst kind. It is just a small step away from a government claiming that a downs syndrome or otherwise disabled child (or adult) has a life that is not worth living. Those determinations may be acceptable for families who love them to make — families who see their loved ones suffer may well decide that the best course of action is to let them go, but it should never be a decision that a government should make.


Conveniently ignores the risk of provoking seizures in transport and of the additional discomfort inflicted with PEG+trach for no benefit to outcome 

It wasn’t about “life worth living” it was about “inflicting further suffering for no benefit to outcome.” Remember that at the time of the decision Alfie had already spent a year on the vent-thus roughly equalizing to the life extension benefit we use for end stage cancer Tx. 

Also the court decision didn’t use the same legal grounds as child abuse... It was not about “protecting” Alfie from his “abusive” parents, it was about considering his rights and best interests. Unless we are gonna claim that children have no human rights and/or that they are overridden by parents in all situations?

Also this

Yes, tPA can and does move patients from PEG/Trach to more independent. The mRS is validated. It’s not an opinion. I’ve done it countless times and a move from 2 to 1 can mean going back to work, driving. It’s a huge marker for patient independence and it is also important for long term healthcare costs. They also provided an ordinal shift which shows improvement from not walking to walking. So yeah, some of that is champagne worthy. If you don’t like that, **long term** mortality is also improved in other studies after an upfront risk, a gamble (to use your analogy) most people take because stroke left untreated carries a high mortality itself.

The mortality increase you cite in WAKE UP is probably the biggest highlight of your misunderstanding. You are arguing the statistical problems of studies, then you cite a mortality rate that was not statistically significant. Further, if you bother to read the text you would find that 5 of the deaths in the tPA arm were not related to stroke. "

Uptodate isn't terrible for stuff regarding CKD/cirrhosis and stuff like that.

--------

General stuff:

Moderate to high protein diets are good for weight loss and health (as long as you don't have CKD4/ESRD), low-moderate carbs/fat is also okay. High fat or high carb probably aren't ideal. 1.5-2g/kg of protein (if also adequately hydrating) on a hypocaloric diet can be beneficial for fat loss + lean mass retention. Aragon and Schoenfeld specifically have discussions on this, there's some youtube talks, and they've also published a couple of articles on this here and there.

Liquid carbohydrates = baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad. Except for maybe milk, if people aren't lactose intolerant. Dairy consumption has been associated with weight maintenance after a period of weight loss.

Nutrient timing doesn't really matter.

Having large versus small meals doesn't really matter (unless someone has some sort of pathology that makes large meals hard, like gastroparesis). But for a generally healthy overweight person, the myth that small meals somehow helps them out is false.

Breakfast isn't necessarily the most important meal of the day. But intermittent fasting doesn't magically make people lose weight/get healthier either. The benefits come from some people being able to adhere to diets better, and restriction calories adequate via that.

Fiber is basically magic, specifically metamucil. Diarrhea? Metamucil. Constipation? Metamucil. IBS? well, maybe metamucil even though there isn't necessarily good evidence. Don't like wasting a bunch of toilet paper? Metamucil. SBO? No metamucil :(

I have just found it to be a shame for the one or two profoundly mentally ill patients who spent about 6 months each on one of the inpatient units I was on. They occationally saw a psychiatrist but missed out on group therapy, DBT, psychologist appointments, etc that they may have benefited from. I know these disorders are notoriously hard to treat, so realistically I am not sure if it would have made a difference. In the cases I saw (a very severe ED and diabulemia/ED) it was frustrating because they weren't improving mentally and therefore they weren't improving medically. We had minimal training on treating patients with severe ED's on our med surg unit. But I agree that inpatient psych might not have been the best place for them either. "

Every test has false positives that need to be kept in mind when ordering that test, and the consequences of those false positives need to be kept in mind. IMO it is reasonable that this should includes social/system consequences as well as true medical ones. After all, it should include the need for further work-up necessitated by the avoidance of lawsuits rather than real clinical suspicion."

The problem is the pie is finite and everyone wants the biggest piece possible.

We know a lot and our training is up there with some of the most brutal regimens in the world, most of us, especially primary care and even subspecialists albeit to a lesser degree deserve a lot more than we make.

So the plantation owners squeeze the most out of us field slaves while keeping the house negroes happy (MD administrators, CMOs etc) and they think all is good. Every once in a while they will throw the field slaves a trinket (doctors day luncheon, discounted cafeteria meals) without actually caring about what the slave really feels.

I disagree. If they're not persecuted yet, it's certainly heading that way.

They just want to make that quick buck, don't actually care about their patients' health, and want to cut corners in every possible way. 

I'm not a doctor. I do know a fair few. I can't name more than one or two who went into the profession for the money. Nearly every doctor I know wants to help people.

 Uneducated people who post reviews about things they don't understand doesn't help the perception. I don't know how I feel about the lawsuit approach this particular doctor took. I think that the patient needed to be more educated on what they were supposed to expect. I blame most of the billing problems on insurance companies, but that's a different rant."

medicine,"This campaign has done a great job of making us all consider sepsis as a diagnosis, as it was woefully under-diagnosed in the past. I’ll give it that. 

But demanding broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and a very large fluid bolus all within an hour is a bit much, especially if the cause of a patient’s symptoms isn’t actually sepsis. 

A man found down in the Arizona summer at a construction site who’s “febrile” and tachy? Sepsis! The girl with epilepsy that didn’t take her meds this week  who’s altered, tachy, and has a
 mild WBC elevation following a seizure? Sepsis! The man who did cocaine and heroin ten minutes before showing up to the ED and now has tachycardia and tachypnea? Sepsis! Load them up with antibiotics and fluids, call the medicine team, and don’t stop to consider alternative diagnoses because you don’t have time. Do it all. Now! You have 24 minutes left before you get a stern letter from a “nurse supervisor” about meeting some asinine metric.

medicine,"There is no perioperative care fee. It's all bundled into the operative fee, so a complex patient can be a huge loss if they're in the hospital for a month with lots of complications. Hiring an ortho PA comes out of the global fee. Consulting a hospitalist PA generates a separate fee. This shouldn't be abused, but it's the way to manage complex patients without losing tons of money for the surgeon. 

Also, the hospital is definitely subsidizing some hospitalist groups, because they would never find an orthopedic surgeon to cover trauma if they were admitting all the geriatric falls every single night. Subspecialists are not easy to find. "

medicine,"I disagree with the cited article. I would argue that performing a pelvic exam with anaesthesized women is morally unproblematic if the genitalia are part of the operation situs. 

First, it seems absurd to me that I would not examine the OP site before the operation. Why would you draw a line between clinical examination and holding and maneuvering a device that literally goes through the vagina?

Second, the heart of my argument: I disagree with the sexualization of the male and female body of patients. The body is the object of our profession. I accept that patients feel awkward when their genitalia and anus are the object of an examination, because in the outside world these body parts are laden with significance. I would argue, though, that we as physicians can make it less uncomfortable, if we just act towards genitalia as we act towards banal body parts like the arm. I would argue that sexualization of genitalia in medicine causes barriers to exams like DRU and scrotum palpation that many respect too highly and that can damage the quality of our care. (As a side note: To this day I am outraged when I think back to my student years when an attending put out the statement that he does not want students in the delivery room in order to respect the dignity of the women. Well, I guess I learn how that works from the books only then.)

Third, if we want capable physicians, students need to learn on live bodies. They need to check tendon reflexes, palpate the abdomen and do pelvic exams.

My arguments has the following requirements: Tact, guidance by doctors, professional demeanor and treating people and their bodies with dignity and respect. 

Disclosure: I am not a woman. I did do a pelvic exam right before a vaginal hysterectomy operation as a fourth year med student. "

Seriously DOs tend to be students who didn’t get into an MD school which doesn’t mean they are necessarily less smart. Most of what it takes to get into med school, DO or MD has almost nothing to do w actually being a doctor or skills you’ll need. It’s amazingly interesting and yet simultaneously unhelpful subjects like zoology, organic chemistry, physics, botany. Plus you have to be good at reading passages about Pablo Picasso and answering obtuse poorly written and intentionally vague questions about them. Great stuff, right?!?

But yes DOs have to do manipulation which most of them think is bogus but they do it bc they have to. Most DO schools have a percentage of superstars who match into competitive specialties (10-15%) and the rest tend to do primary care. Otherwise if you see an actual doctor he is a doctor, whether DO or MD. But MDs are more respected for the purposes of getting residencies. Beyond that though there isn’t much difference.

There are some specialty specific quirks you might not expect also like obgyn residencies are ~95% MD at least in the southeast."

You can't tell by looking at him. He is handsome, intelligent and successful. If you spend enough time with him you notice he gets tired easily and moves slowly and there are heavy pain days where his feet swell and turn bright purple and his back is bright flaming red. He has horrible migraine headaches. He used to be outdoorsy and loved hiking, now he has terrible altitude sickness. And he has a basket of medications he takes daily just for symptom management. His life has been changed permanently. 

We had a talk the other day about the phrase ""lyme literate doctor."" I told him it's a trigger warning to physicians that the patient may be high maintenance, demanding, hypochondriac. I asked him to never ask for a ""lyme literate doctor."" Of course that's not what he wants to hear. Doors slamming in his face, people writing him off, and the fear that he won't be able to find someone comfortable prescribing his medications is real. In a way, he's lucky because I will be there to advocate for him as a physician, to find colleagues who will take him seriously.

It’s important to be very clear with patients and their families that there is a margin of error, and any prediction of prognosis is little more than an educated guess.

You cannot use standard business metrics to effectively measure provider performance, and dehumanizing providers to the level required for most process automation procedures represents a true risk of harm to patients.

Being able to put a face to a disease and the experience of working through it with seasoned docs helps so much. 

If it helps, I remember on a rotation we were required to work a night at our student run clinic as senior clinicians. This meant seeing a patient by ourselves (later checked by an attending of course), then also teaching an M2 who was trying to learn from you. I was nervous because I did not feel like I knew enough to be a good enough teacher, but I learned quickly that was not the case. It was eye-opening just how much I had picked up in such a short time compared to where I was a year before.

We know that tPA carries a risk of symptomatic hemorrhage and death from the NINDS trials from 1995 and ECASS, but the event rates were low, the cohort involved patients with small infarcts and mild-moderate symptoms, so maybe that would caution you against giving tPA to a wake up Stroke who fit this inclusion profile of symptoms were mild. If symptoms were more disabling, I could be convinced to treat a wake-up stroke patient with tPA (and where I used to work, we did this not infrequently if the head CT was normal and symptoms were significant—before the era of thrombectomy.)

This study is very interesting and the results long awaited. It needs replicating on a larger scale, perhaps using tenecteplase. "

medicine,"More rigorous studies are needed. From the results, it should looked into as the intervention is cheap with few side effects and the benefit could possibly be quite significant.

medicine,"I was just never aware this was even an issue. On another thread where this is being discussed, someone made the point that the average person, when told that a student will be involved in a surgery (whether or not an exam is involved, which for me personally is not as much of an issue if you’re down there anyway), they don’t necessarily realize what that involvement entails. Many are under the impression that this simply means the student is only observing or handing over medical equipment. It’s not even an issue if the student is participating in the exam or procedure itself, but it’s the right of the patient to be made explicitly aware of what another party’s (the student’s) involvement entails. Handing over medical instruments and physically touching/entering a person are two very different things, and most people do not have a working knowledge of procedures that may seem standard or obvious to someone in the medical profession.

medicine,"&gt; Yale isn't necessarily one of the best med schools in the country. People doesn't fly from all over the country and world to be seen at Yale. They do to be seen at Mayo. Big difference.

Agreed, which is why Mayo is great for residency and Yale generally isn't. Now, remind me, what role does the medical student play in managing a heart-liver transplantation for a patient with uncorrected cyanotic heart disease?

&gt; What makes a good medical school is the strength of the facilities and faculty. Mayo has one of the best healthcare systems in the country, meaning it has a lock on both.

You need faculty who want to teach, not to mention good anatomists, basic science professors, etc. Mayo's excellent cardiac surgeons are probably great at taking young fellows under their wing, but I somehow doubt they're eager to teach cardiac physiology 101 to first year med students. Also, no offense, but I really doubt there are a lot of high achieving college graduates who are eager to move to the middle of nowhere for four years in their early 20s.

I'm a nurse, I saw a 19 year old girl with terminal cancer intubated and put on a vent against her wishes because her parents refused to accept that her life was over. It's absolutely horrifying to watch people with no medical education demand that everything be done when you know that they have no idea what they are asking for.

medicine,"&gt;Agreed, which is why Mayo is great for residency and Yale generally isn't. Now, remind me, what role does the medical student play in managing a heart\-liver transplantation for a patient with uncorrected cyanotic heart disease?

None at all, outside of observing the operation. They do, however, have the opportunity be lectured by the world expert in heart\-liver transplantation in patients with uncorrected cyanotic heart disease, rotate with that surgeon, and get letters of recommendation from that surgeon. Apply that same concept to a similar caliber of faculty across the board.

&gt;You need faculty who want to teach, not to mention good anatomists, basic science professors, etc. Mayo's excellent cardiac surgeons are probably great at taking young fellows under their wing, but I somehow doubt they're eager to teach cardiac physiology 101 to first year med students.

Mayo and Yale are both academic medical centers. In general, many of the faculty HAVE to teach \- whether it be residents or medical students. If they didn't want to teach, they would be in private practice making twice the money. General statement, of course. But even if that weren't the case \- you could say the exact same thing about Yale.

You do make a good point about anatomy and basic science professors. I'd counter that with my experience as a current medical student. I will say that a lot of the pre\-clinical curriculum is mostly driven by self\-education. Every single medical student relies extensively on external resources such as Pathoma, Boards and Beyond, UWorld, etc. The strength of the pre\-clinical curriculum doesn't rely on faculty NEARLY as much as the clinical curriculum, because in these cases the facts are discrete and generally immovable, and can be learned from crappy lectures or online. For example, that's why foreign medical grads from 3rd world countries are able to hit obscenely high scores on STEP1, sometimes even demolishing most scorers at the best US MD schools. On the contrary, the clinical curriculum is almost entirely driven by hands\-on experience and exposure.

&gt;Also, no offense, but I really doubt there are a lot of high achieving college graduates who are eager to move to the middle of nowhere for four years in their early 20s.

I won't argue that Rochester isn't ""the middle of nowhere"", but I can assure you from personal experience that New Haven, Connecticut isn't the urban utopia of NYC or SF, either. A high\-achieving college graduate is more likely to go wherever they believe they will get the best education and feel that they will be able to best achieve their career goals \- that's part of the ""high\-achieving"" bit. It's just a matter of if they are high\-achieving enough to trade 4 years in a less desirable location for a higher quality education \- and in that regard, I'd argue that the more high achieving students are more likely to attend school at Mayo. The massive scholarships thrown around by Mayo don't hurt either.

&gt;At the end of the day, this is kind of a pointless discussion, since the idea of prestige is fairly subjective.

On this, we can agree.

&gt;I can say, though, that I think a graduate from Yale's SOM is, on average, a higher caliber candidate than one from Mayo.

On this, I strongly disagree. The caliber of a candidate for residency programs is 99&amp;#37; driven by the strength of the clinical curriculum, and Mayo has the edge in that regard. Both schools have the same problem of being tertiary/quaternary care centers in rural locations and thus the patient population is largely a factor of the volume of referrals. This results in a patient population of almost entirely complex cases for both schools \- which leaves students deficient in the ""bread and butter"" of medicine. Both schools employ rotations outside of the central hospital system to get around this. The Mayo institution has a far larger reach in both the extent of the institution and the draw of referrals across the country and beyond.

Ultimately, it's kind of like comparing a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, because both schools produce absolutely exceptional physicians who excel at any residency program they end up at."
medicine,"Vitamin C is an acute phase reactant that all animals with the exception of guinea pigs and humans synthesize in their livers during times of stress. In ICU patients, vitamin C is consumed because it is used as an antioxidant and isn’t repleted because people in the ICU are not eating. Patients in the ICU therefore have vitamin C levels so low that they’re often undetectable, which is a problem because vitamin C is required as a cofactor to make endogenous pressors.

This guy did a before and after study where they found less mortality and less need for pressors in patients who were given thiamine, vitamin C, and steroids. Thiamine was given because it is necessary in processing oxaloate or something (?) and ICU patients are also usually thiamine deplete.

There needs to be randomized trials before they’re sure that it’s real, but this guy is a believer. "

I used to smoke. I’m asthmatic, so that was a particularly dumb decision for me, but hell, it was a choice I made. I liked smoking. My life was pretty stressful at the time and I didn’t have much going for me, but smoking was a predictable, dependable part of my day. I wasn’t a hugely heavy smoker; about 10-12 cigarettes a day, but it wasn’t something I could easily give up. It was part of how I socialized with my friends. It’s even how I met my husband, of all things. It was working for me, and I enjoyed it. 

Until it wasn’t. I had a couple bad runs of really hard to tackle asthma attacks, followed by pneumonia. I was *sick* and I was sick of being sick. A walk-in clinic doc chewed me out when I came in for a refill of my puffers because he could smell smoke on me. He was *super* Irish and I barely caught half of what he said, but it made an impression.

Lean mean private healthcare machine? Give me a fucking break and open up some eyes to real world. Waste in private companies is rampant. 

I'm not sure I agree with the pay. Physician burnout is about time, not money. Schedules need to be sane. I also think physicians could use guidance on work limits. Some private neurosurgeon is pissed getting out of bed because he's on call, but he'll make 10k that day so you know he's going in even though he's had 6hrs of sleep on two nights. 

I'm not sure physicians should be bitching about ""deserving more"" if they're a specialists. Since specialty pay has been skyrocketing since the 80s. Specialists have never been making more money than now. But they don't need to be cramming those extra few patients a week for monetary reasons.   "

&gt;Yeah those were all based on clinical experience or physiologic reasoning. That's exactly why we need data.

Actually it was based off of poorly designed clinical trials for CHF with poor dosing.  Not just one person's experience.


&gt;We have data that supports Xiidra's efficacy vs placebo
We have data with applicability issues, and the effect size is embarrassingly small.

No trial that has shown Xiidra's benefit is applicable, yet you  linked an article that talked about physicians receiving gifts and the authors tried to apply old broad psychological studies about estimating coins in jars and splitting up compensation fairly to this subject.  You can't have it both ways there.

&gt;This is basically a good approach, the only thing I'm questioning is the Xiidra vs. Restasis decision. The data for both agents is poor, and therefore you're relying on subjective impressions to make prescribing decisions. These are the decisions most vulnerable to persuasion, and the reason that Pharma spends giant piles of money buying doctors meals. If your point is that your clinical experience is invulnerable to cognitive and recall biases, that would contradict just about everything that is known about psychology and all available research on marketing and incentives. 

I disagree.  I also think the word gift is giving this a negative connotation.  Because I let a pharm rep give my office a meal 3x per year (which I don't touch because the food is always trash) is making me believe Restasis is inferior to Xiidra?

If you look up my name on the sunshine act I have 1 thing on it over the last 3 years of data.  It was for a dinner to learn about a surgical product that I was interested in.  I abandoned the device after a few cases because I didn't like my results (despite glowing trial data) and I now exclusively use a different product (who has never paid for a meal/gift for me or my office).  I made this switch due to my clinical experience despite this impossible-to-overcome implicit bias simply because I got a dinner on the house.  I can think of 4 examples immediately off the top of my head where I asked the product rep to stop coming/contacting me because I am using something else - despite their offers for dinners/whatever.

medicine,"There are many nurses in my lab that I have seen ""mashing"" on a hematoma. Anecdotally, I would say that it typically disperses and softens the hematoma when performed immediately as the bleeding occurs (obviously, pressure at the arteriotomy site should be performed simultaneously). If a hematoma is big enough it may hinder ones ability to palate the pulse so massaging out the lump may help one to better control bleeding. I know of no literature to support the fact that it might reduce downstream complications such as infection, pain, seroma, but I see no harm in performing gentle massage to a hematoma while holding pressure on the artery. I wouldn't be overly aggressive (as the term mashing suggests) and I would avoid this if causing unnecessary discomfort. Finally, I would only do this on a very fresh hematoma, not a large one that has become established because of the risk of causing rebleeding. Although this applies mostly to groin bleeding, I would say that gentle  massage may help alleviate pain and the tense forearm that may due to bleeding from radial access."

I don't know any location where medics are taught how to insert foleys during initial training, but it's an easy skill to learn. Similarly, applying splints in the ED is nothing like applying splints in the prehospital setting and would require a good bit of extra training for paramedics. Administration of medications will likely depend on hospital policy and state scope of practice. Most states I've seen list a very specific formulary of medications approved for EMS providers. 

As for triage, it depends on what you mean. If you mean seeing patients as they arrive and deciding who goes back to a room and who waits in the waiting room, etc, I would say that's a bad idea and you should run away from that liability nightmare. I saw an example of this on your thread in /r/ems. Taking radio reports would likely be easy to pick up as long as it didn't involve giving orders to the crew calling in. "

&gt; Studies demonstrating the disparate mesh complication rates by procedure indication include:

&gt; ●For POP surgery — In a systematic review of 11 trials and 9 studies that assessed mesh-related complications after POP repair, the mean total complication rates were 27 percent for anterior repair, 20 percent for posterior repair, and 40 percent for combined repairs [2].

&gt; ●For SUI surgery — In a meta-analysis of 11 trials and 5 studies, the combined mesh erosion rates for retropubic and transobturator sling procedures ranged from 0 to 15 percent [5]. A different study that followed nearly 600 women randomly assigned to either a retropubic or transobturator sling for up to 24 months reported synthetic mesh complications in approximately 4 percent of women [6].

&gt;  ●In one study of nearly 28,000 women undergoing prolapse surgery, 3 percent of women who had transvaginal mesh prolapse repair required reintervention within one year, although 2 percent of women who did not receive transvaginal mesh also underwent reintervention [7]. The risk of reintervention was greatest for the women under age 65 years who received transvaginal mesh compared with similarly aged women who did not receive transvaginal mesh (hazard ratio 1.76).

&gt; ●In a retrospective cohort study including nearly 60,000 women who underwent a mesh-based procedure for SUI, the risk of complication requiring reintervention was 1.2 percent at one year and cumulatively increased to 3.3 percent at 10 years [8]. Thus, 10 years after SUI surgery, 1 of every 30 women required a second procedure for mesh-related complications. In this study, complications were defined as mesh exposure, fistula, pain, or urinary retention.

Worth noting a couple mesh products have been taken off market already-they encouraged an encapsulation response which lead to exposure. However since then there are different meshes that try to avoid the structural properties of the removed ones and improved surgical technique (e.g. putting no tension on the mesh since that encourages erosion) so things are looking better. Fearmongering articles such as the one posted are not helping though. There are several other corps involved in the mesh business (e.g. 3M) of which Boston Scientific is one of them and should now be avoided

Mesh for SUI is more common than mesh for prolapse

He has been in stable NSR since his ablation 3 years ago, and has much more functionality than before.

medicine,"I think you're missing a step there. Part of the medical testimony was that the experts could not rule out that the child could still feel pain, despite his extensive brain degeneration. It was also agreed upon by experts that the helicopter transport could increase the risk of his seizures, which could be painful. As such, the court ruled it was wrong or cruel to subject the kid to possible pain for no conceivable benefit. It did not say that death would be better for him than to continue living. 

Specifically, going to you're third point, I'm not sure that they ruled that he could not have interventions to prolong his life. It's more that in order to prolong his life, there would be an increased risk of the child suffering, which would be wrong to pursue. 

If you really want to boil it down, it was between dying with comfort measures at Alder Hey sooner, versus subjecting the kid to possible pain and suffering to only die later in Italy. The Alder Hey option is neutral (as withdrawal of care for natural death is ethically neutral), while the Italy option has the additional negative of possibly causing suffering to the child for the same ultimate outcome."

I don't pay your salary, but my work certainly does. That's why my hospital plasters huge billboards around town about how our hospital has the best doctors in town. That's why every homemaker journal in the state has reviews of best pediatricians and internists. That's why the patient's family waits around all day for the doctor to come by and update them, even if the nurse can relay 90% of the information just as well. At the end of the day, the consumer (patients) seeks out doctors, the nurses are a nice side benefit.

That being said, it's not such a bad gig. You have nice unions that limit you to one blood draw a day, and give you mandatory lunch and coffee breaks. Meanwhile, I work 60 hours a week and can get sued for millions of dollars if I so much as imply that maybe the patient won't live forever."

medicine,"Given that you're a pediatrician, this makes more sense than it would for most physicians.  Children can't be held responsible parents refusing to fill scripts, and in the case of younger children, failing to administer medication.  Nor can children be held responsible for for parents posting false information online, or for that matter for parents failing to get them to appointments or parents being aggressive towards staff.  I wonder if the insurance company in question has the same  set of rules for physicians who treat mentally competent adults.

I can see where medication non-compliance and posting false information online could often be ""he said, she said"" matters, and that's the sort of thing that I could see malpractice insurers fearing expensive lawsuits over, and not allowing as a basis for patient-firing for either adults or children.  It's not always possible to really prove that someone hasn't been taking medication, and some people aren't taking it because they genuinely can't afford to fill their scripts.  Online social media accounts can be hacked, and relatives often have passwords.  Fake accounts can easily be set up in the name of a person who doesn't have a real account to point to as evidence.  Much harder to prove than things that happen in the office (no-shows, aggression towards staff).

Since you're dealing with child patients, I really hope that child welfare reporting criteria (and real-world agency responses) cover all the bases that this insurer prohibits you from ""firing"" patients over.  "

medicine,"&gt; but these compliant (and often highly motivated) people were in the minority.

I'm one of those, and my PCP was absolutely fascinated with how my Garmin 920XT integrated with MyFitnessPal and the iPhone health data array.  Including how you can export MyFitnessPal food logs (if you're a premium member) and generate a pivot table in Excel to not only track calories, sodium, cholesterol etc intake, but add in database rows for blood pressure and lab values, as well as VO2 max and stress thresholds from Garmin at discrete time points. 

I created one for the last 5 years of my tracking, and I can literally pinpoint the exact 5 months of eating way too much cholesterol (lots of scrambled eggs after 10+ mile runs) that got me to a high LDL. 12 months of a rigorous diet and cutting my sodium to &lt;1400mg/day, and now I beautiful lab values.  

Based on what I see in the circles I run in, and what technology is available now, the future generation(s) who are really tech-saavy are going to be collecting terabytes of data on themselves not only for personal tracking and benefit, but also large epidemiological studies that can answer many more questions than the ones we currently have.   

I am just getting into TrainingPeaks, but the absolutely insane API can interface with Garmin, MyFitnessPal etc, and in the future, I would not be shocked if *someday* there was a front end for hospital EMRs to query historical data from it to compare to traditional stress tests and other physical exams for patients.  "
medicine,"Apologies, I wasn't attempting to elaborate my argument. Only pointing out that you were setting up a straw man. There's a world of gray area between our current (completely unplanned and haphazard) system and a pure public option.

For instance, we need regulations that for-profit manufacturers cannot have their sole production capability in a major disaster zone. They have no financial incentive to build in redundancy. The supply side of the equation needs regulatory intervention to ensure at least the basics. It can't be left to free market forces. That's my point.

And I'm always quick to add that we've only had health care worth having for about a century. We need to start rethinking our old approach to economics because it's not applicable to this relatively new industry. "
medicine,"They really shouldn't be saying that for ablation treatment of atrial fibrillation.  Recurrence rates are around 80% at 5 years with a single attempt.  With multiple attempts (mean ~2), success at 5 years is still only about 2/3.  [Citation.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25528745)

Treatment for atrial flutter, on the other hand, is something like 97% successful."
medicine,"I agree. The treatment effect is often exaggerated in PP, which is likely what we're seeing here. I'm really shocked that over 1/4 of the MT patients ended up getting ablated--that seems to be a huge confounder. I'm just really unsure how to interpret the results in light of that. 

The other problem with surgical mazes, particularly the minimally invasive ones like the Convergent procedure or on-pump thoracotomy mazes, are that we also don't have good data on them. We know they provide the best long-term freedom from AF and rhythm-controlling meds, but we don't have any data on the actual mortality benefit of them. It is also pretty damn hard to get a trial with an N in the 1000s for a surgical maze, because patients today are just very surgery-averse. "

medicine,"&gt; the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services cited the heart transplant program for its significantly worse-than-expected outcomes and threatened to cut off Medicare funds in August if the problems were not fixed

~11% of transplant centers in the US have at least one program that is flagged by CMS for underperforming, so that in and of itself isn't too, too bad. As someone else mentioned, when you are dealing with denominators that are small, and frequently less than 100 txp per year for a program, a small number of events makes a big difference. However, the data is cumulative over the past six 6-month cycles, so it is supposed to balance out... I would add that expected outcomes are risk adjusted, so if a program takes on fewer high risk cases bc they are on watch, a negative outcome (even if a fluke) can be even more detrimental."

I've never understood this. 24 hour shifts are *insane*. If you woke up at 5 AM, showered, ate, and went to work at 7 AM, *you are not going to be capable of doing your best work at 6:45 AM the following day*. 

So much of medical practice seems to be based upon the idea that because doctors tend to be highly intelligent and disciplined, they're immune to the limitations of the human body. It's bizarre and it's *unnecessary*. "

Streptokinase (and urokinase) is inferior to tPA. Streptokinase is an exogenous molecule derived from bacteria. It is indiscriminate in its breakdown of fibrin. Recombinant tPA (alteplase) is derived from endogenous tPA (you have it in you right now) and is more specific for clot-bound fibrin. Still not perfect. TNK May be more specific.

medicine,"I would argue that there is little difference if your argument is against profit motives in healthcare. 

Profit is the motivator for investment in healthcare R&amp;D, especially for devices made by physicians. Do you really think that most of the people inventing, testing and then getting medical devices FDA approved would go through that time consuming and onerous process if there wasn't a lucrative payout at the end of it?

Profit is the driver for all business decisions and healthcare is a business here in the US and it is a business even in systems where there is a single payer. "
medicine,"Well, what you call “Americanizing“ is what I call adding bureaucratic accountability metrics and legal parasites. Although at least doctors in the United States generally only get sued and not thrown in jail.As far as I’m concerned call it Americanizing or whatever you want, it’s still trying to ring efficiencies out of a system by using check boxing and metrics. You’re right it sucks and it’s going to get worse as costs go up which they are in the UK just like the United States. As a matter of fact, the last data I looked at healthcare costs in the UK we’re going up faster than healthcare costs in the United States by about a percentage point. No government wants to afford that so they have to put in some stop loss and therefore the checks and balances are only going to get worse in my estimation."
medicine,"Bingo. 

The patient had a congenital bronchogenic cyst that had fluctuated in size most of their life, and recently had began to swell and compress the left atrium, compromising his cardiac function. We think the 2 EBUS's then led to an infection within the cyst, which is what pushed him into extremis so quickly. 

We didn't think he could tolerate anesthesia or laying supine on the OR table because he essentially had no left atrium when he laid supine. We had IR tap the cyst while he was prone, and they got about 300cc of frank pus out of the cyst.

Draining the cyst resolved his symptoms pretty immediately, and we gave him some abx and a referral to a quaternary center where he had the cyst removed and ablated surgically, as our surgeon didn't feel as comfortable doing that themselves. "

medicine,"The issue with accusing only certain players of profiteering in the healthcare industry, like pharma or insurance companies, is that you are ignoring the fact that the same accusation could be made of physicians and nurses as we profit off of the suffering of others and hold a monopoly on treating said suffering.

The only difference is magnitude. 

So when people start saying we should ""limit the profits"" of pharma or insurance companies, we should be cognizant that it is not that difficult to make the jump from that to limiting the ""personnel costs"" of physicians and nurses, which is also a big concern to the people that talk about ""systemic costs"".

I'd need to log you in somehow, would you be open to validating/ signing off on a list of things Alexa documented before you left the room? Does constantly prompting Alexa interfere with the patient interaction too much? What about Alexa show me the I/O?  What if the phrasing mostly had to be the same to properly trigger the documentation? Is that too restrictive? Do you want Alexa talking back to you too confirm what you're about to do? Ok Jenny stopping blood scan the bag please?"

medicine,"&gt;People raise ""federally funded research"" rather routinely as an example of why drugs costs should be lower when in fact it contributes to higher drug costs. 

No, pharmaceutical companies and lobbyists routinely raise R&amp;D costs as a reason to raise drug prices, when they are actually benefiting off of federally funded research. 

&gt;Commercially viable federally funded research is only viable if it is sold to pharma companies. If this research was provided for free - there is a reasonable argument that it should drop drug prices. However, this research is sold by Universities (where the research is done) for a profit. This is certainly understandable, but the profit and the research therefore contributes to drug costs and does absolutely nothing to reduce drug costs.

As an EM consultant I don't feel overly qualified to make detailed comments about the article. Especially with the neuro/EM politics surrounding tPA. However, I do want to say is this for anyone young enough to not remember:

When I started in medicine we put stroke patients in a room and waited to see what was left. Treatment was rehabilitation. There was no tPA. No thrombectomy. Stroke was a horrific, debilitating event and we had nothing in our bag of tricks to help.

This was in my living memory. 

Now we are doing this. Medicine still blows me away after all this time."
medicine,"Well isn’t that the whole point of looking at positive outcomes verse negative outcomes, all-cause? We know the risks associated with tPA administration, but there is no way for the patient or their family to know what they think will be the best for them. All we can do is show them what is most likely to be most beneficial."
medicine,"I’m sorry. I don’t want to come off as arrogant, I just want to have a worthwhile discussion.

I thought the tPA comment would add to the discussion but I may have been wrong.

So one at a time, centers of excellence for Rare Disease X are developing, but often ""center of excellence"" is unregulated.

I can't tell you how many times people assumed I was having a stroke, and me trying to tell them it was just a migraine. I still cannot believe how just changing my diet has restored so much of my life! 

Rave over....b blockers worked very well for me. Now, the migraines are solely controlled by vegetarian diet, no alcohol, plenty of sleep and try to reduce stress. "

medicine,don't forget about taxes though. the 200k tax bracket is a bit higher than the 100k one which would close the gap even more. If you make 230k your taxes will be around 50k.

My people do what we do for the pleasure of treating patients and acutely saving their lives, and the glory and adrenaline rush of the crazy case and great save.

How many people choose primary practice for the pleasure of truly knowing your patient, of being the person they go to for everything, the person they trust, vs. it being the only thing they can get?  I don't know.  But obviously it's a balance, as all things are."

medicine,"I am an optometrist. I had a 47-year-old Hispanic female present for visual distortion in her right eye. Reviewing the chart, she had an occurrence 6 to 8 months ago of CSC (Central Serous chorioretinopathy). Sure enough, she had it again. This is most commonly found type a males, people who are pretty stressed out, or people who are sensitive to systemic steroids. Cortisol basically makes them leaky. I asked about medication: negative. I asked about stress and sleep: negative. Nothing that would indicate another flareup. At this point, I’m about to refer her to a retinal specialist, as this will probably warrant some anti-VEGf treatment. Last chance: “When did this begin, again?” One month ago. “Anything ANYTHING new about that time?” That’s when she pulls out a tube of Cortisone-10. “What exactly are you using this for (thinking something for near the eyes)?” Sheepishly she replies “Feminine itch”. ��. In my head (You’re frequently applying a decent amount of corticosteroids to a mucosal membrane and you’re getting a systemic reaction). “Ok, I want you to discontinue the cream, see your gynecologist soon, and we’ll see you back for a follow-up”. One month later, all better. Seriously, I don’t usually think about things that low during an eye exam but I was kinda proud of that one."

At the end he had a cardiac arrest, his son did CPR until paramedics came and they resuscitated him. He came around, wondering what had happened. Broken ribs/sternum but otherwise awake and aware.

And it was so much pain, i have not been able to get over it as there is no medical cure to this Virus, and the antiretroviral Drug is for a life time. A lot of people told me about doctor Apama who had read online that he could heal several diseases and infections including HIV. They gave me his email: Drapamaherbalhealingcentre@gmail.com. I wrote him and he assured me that his medicine would heal me. I placed an order for his medicine and it was delivered to me here in Zagreb. I was on this treatment for 4 weeks though i didn’t believe in it, i was just trying it out of frustration and after the 4th week, i went for a check up, And it was unbelievable that 4 different test results all read Hiv virus negative. I never believed HIV has a cure. I'm healed, Negative to Hiv and I'm a living witness. I don’t know how to appreciate Dr Apama. I just want to help others out there. I have joined many Media to post this testimonies and I know a lot of people will find this useful.

medicine,"Heme Onc doc - I haven't read this book, but the fundamental issue with the Warburg hypothesis (e.g. the metabolic theory of cancer) is that it looks at the altered metabolism in cancer cells, and says: ""Ah-ha! That's the difference between these cells and normal cells, therefore this difference causes cancer!""

The problem is that these alterations are not the cause of, but rather, the result of the driving oncogenic mutations. Malignant transformation arises, generally speaking, due to loss of function mutations in tumor suppressor genes, or gain of function mutations in oncogenes. 

For instance, some of the high anaerobic glycolytic rates seen may be due to an overexpressed form of mitochondrial hexokinase, which drives glycolytic activity. HOWEVER, we now know that loss of function in the VHL (Von Hippel Lindau) tumor suppressor gene results in an upregulating of glycolytic enzymes.

That's not to say that inhibition of glycoloysis wouldn't be an effective treatment - there are drugs in development that aim to target and inhibit the process. But the actual cause of malignancy is not altered metabolism, but rather, the result.

medicine,"It's because the government decided to go with a uniform solution for the Military Health System and they don't want to pay for two separate systems, one for the MHS and one for the VA, especially when patients often end up using both healthcare systems. The cost (both monetary and time wise) of developing CPRS to meet the needs of the MHS were deemed to be too high.There were oodles of people involved in developing the RFP for both the MHS and the VA, and many of them were practicing clinicians, so yes, they did talk to people on the front line. You can argue that the MHS and VA should be allowed to keep separate systems, but then you run into complaints like the OP has. It's frustrating, I know, but there's no perfect solution for all of this and while user satisfaction is very, very important, there are so many things that have to be taken into consideration. "

medicine,"Words from the outside, looking in (apologies for the intrusion):

The *very first* thing an abuser must do is to isolate the victim.

I would ask you how you became aware that you were being abusive?

That awareness woke in you who you were, before you were abused, and the hunger to rediscover yourself.

That awareness is a gift of healing to be treasured and nurtured.  You need not nevessarily leave a field of study and practice you chose because abusers continue to dominate it.

Be the one whom the students can look up to.  Be honest, make amends.  Be the voice of reason, the mentor they trust.  These are powers you already own, and they carry so much more influence than abuse.

Let it be known that you will not tolerate abuse in your presence, that you want to be called on it if it comes from you.  Be aware of isolating behaviors.  Do the work you love, be yourself.

You embody the hope of what should be, what can be.

People want compassion from their physicians.  Administrators would rather they be treated like fungible assets, *just as they indoctrinate their students in abuse.*  You temporarily succumbed to the abusive programming.

I would ask that you not walk away in isolation.  Walk away if you must, but not quietly, and, not alone.  Smart victims become deceptive to the abuser, make safe exit plans that disempower the abuser.

Doctors are smart and strong.  A bunch of once isolated doctors, the sky is the limit.  Abusers can be held liable for their behavior.

Terms like *knew or should have known*, *practice and pattern* and *hostile environment*, as they relate to abusive behavior and policy (omg they codified and scheduled abuse), come to mind. 

*Had they no access to mental health professionals?*

medicine,"In all states, you have to state that you have no mental \(or physical\) impairment that will impede your ability to practice medicine. In many states you are asked if you have any mental illness at all, regardless of whether it has any impact, and physicians are routinely denied licenses or shunted into unnecessary and punitive evaluation/remediation because at some point they were in some kind of treatment. It's part of why doctors are so leery of getting any treatment for even routine mental health diagnoses; it can come back to haunt you forever."

It probably isn't morphine that is extending life. It's that a good deal of medical care is worse than useless. And, when done well, hospice/palliative care encourages patients, families, and providers to consider carefully which interventions are consistent with the patient’s goals of care.

Which part of that exactly are you still questioning because im not sure what further evidence could be used. I don't think there is anything calling into question that ""perhaps"" the product is fraudulent. This whole thread seems incredibly propagandized toward industry. 


&gt;I don’t know enough about the legalities involved to comment.  

As someone who pays attention to pharma this is one of the most important aspects of a clinical trial. For regular use, companies can have manufacturing shut down if they don't have their shit together. That's usually not happening until a point where things are so far bad and so many warnings have been issued. It's an area the FDA could definitely grow some bigger balls. 

&gt;improper materials sourcing from a medical device company. 

Perhaps no one bothered with the video complement? There was the whole latter half of it devoted to that. 

There are certainly problems with our PMA and 510k needing to be more strict. It's not like there are never any issues. That's exactly why we can't rely on anecdotes. Like you just attempted to use. Or the top poster that was heralded. How is ""I've used X and it works well"" supposed to be good evidence? 

If a a report came out showing that amalgam had been incorporating bullcrap Chinese ingredients, i wouldn't certainly take it as an attack on the efficacy of prepping teeth for filling nor defend the darn company. 

It's odd but this sub seems to be jeckyl and Hyde for industry issues. I remember when this 

https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medical-devices/dozens-lawsuits-filed-growing-counterfeit-spinal-screw-implant-scandal

medicine,"Complications and comorbidities, major complications and comorbidities, and diagnosis related group.

Hospitals are paid (by Medicare and some others) based on DRG, so for instance, if I admit a patient for acute cholecystitis, that patient would have a prinicipal diagnosis of:

K8000: Calculus of gallbladder with acute cholecystitis without obstruction

This would make the DRG 446: Disorders of the biliary tract w/o MCC or CC

However, if the patient has one of a number of conditions defined to be a CC, the DRG becomes 445: Disorders of the biliary tract w/ CC, which pays a little bit more.  Similarly if they have a condition defined as a MCC, it becomes 444: Disorders of the biliary tract w/ MCC, which pays even more.

Most DRGs are trimodal this way, to increase reimbursement to the hospital for taking care of more complicated patients.  However, if you don't document those comorbidities in the chart, the enhanced DRG will get rejected.  A lot of hospital employ people just to comb charts looking for CC/MCCs that are technically present but the physician didn't bother to document, and they will put a note on the chart for the physician to fix their documentation so the hospital can collect the max allowed."

I suspect the antioxidants in red wine (as opposed to the white wine) are more healthful than the alcohol itself, but then again, from the individual's perspective, it should not matter a whole lot.  Just choose red wine or other high antioxidant alcohols like IPAs or whiskey.

The second one found lowered blood pressure for subjects again with the same genetic marker.  I didn't notice any mention of harm for those without the genetic variant?  For me, I looked up whether I have this genetic variant in my 23andMe data, and fortunately I do!

medicine,"&gt; I'd love it if NIH funded trials at close to the volume that we see from industry sponsored trials. But, realistically, that isn't going to happen. You'd have to triple the NIH's budget.

I propose radically changing the way research is funded, such as mandating contributions to a research agency to conduct the trials.

Let me put it this way, if I went to my IRB with an underpowered study, they would not let me perform it.  If the same number of participants could yield substantially higher quality evidence with no additional cost or risk, I would have no justification for my study design.

But yet somehow we give drug companies a pass. Every drug trial would be substantially higher quality (in terms of what can be inferred from the results) if it were conducted by a public agency.  

&gt;All that said, though, I'm not sure that it really gets back to the remuneration of public research dollars question. If more public agencies are taking their IP through trials, it seems like it is just kicking the can down the road until they get to the problem of what to do with the IP as it gets closer and closer to being able to be marketed.

It sounds a bit like you're fitting my call for reform into the existing mold of how research is funded.  In my ideal world, drug companies conduct no trials."

medicine,"&gt; That phrase absolute priority is from one of my attendings

Just because they're an attending doesn't mean that they are right.  It's true that without the mother, the fetus has a very low chance of survival unless they are close to term, but it still doesn't mean that the mother doesn't get a choice.

&gt; the principle is fairly widespread. If you would do it if she werent pregnant, then do it.

You are misstating the principle here.  The idea is that you as a provider shouldn't decide **not** to do a study just because a woman is pregnant.  But it doesn't mean that you just order the study.  You still have to talk with the patient about the risks and benefits of it.

&gt; No time for stats and shared decision making in trauma

Again, I disagree about 100%.  Most trauma activations are not in immediate danger of their life in the next couple of minutes.  It takes about 30 seconds to have a quick conversation with the patient about why you need to do a CT scan.  If they patient is in extremis, they may not be a candidate to go to the CT scan immediately anyways, and may require resuscitation.  Either way, in that circumstance you can justify just making the decision, because the patient isn't able to participate in decision making.  But to just always say ""I'm going to irradiate you because I don't have time to talk about it"" is nothing more than being lazy."

There are still a lot of variables, but less than when the patient is in an even more agitated state because they're in the ED.

medicine,"&gt; Studies in Europe have suggested that injectable diacetylmorphine, the active ingredient in heroin, can be an effective adjunctive treatment for **chronic, relapsing opioid dependence.**

&gt; METHODS

&gt; In an open-label, phase 3, randomized, controlled trial in Canada, we compared injectable diacetylmorphine with oral methadone maintenance therapy in patients with **opioid dependence that was refractory to treatment**. *Long-term users of injectable heroin who had not benefited from at least two previous attempts at treatment for addiction (including at least one methadone treatment) were randomly assigned to receive methadone (111 patients) or diacetylmorphine (115 patients).* The primary outcomes, assessed at 12 months, were retention in addiction treatment or drug-free status and a reduction in illicit-drug use or other illegal activity according to the European Addiction Severity Index.


The bolded is the part I'm referencing, with the shift to heroin users in italics when describing the actual methods.

It might be a simple oversight. It might also be that studies about opioid dependence get published more than studies specifically about IV heroin addicts. I don't know. Heroin addiction is opiate addiction, yes, but generalizing clean IV heroin therapy to a general opioid population (when the study was specifically run only with IV heroin addicts) is very misleading.

EDIT: to be clear, this is still a great study. It provides a lot of support for the Surgeon General's position on clean injection sites. But with the abstract worded the way it is, this is also the kind of study that can be picked up by clickbait press outlets and headlined as ""Clean heroin injections may be the answer for the opioid crisis."""

It's part how uncomfortable our culture is with death and part physicians being more educated about exactly what those futile treatments are and are not going to do. I just wish the docs could have an honest conversation with patients, and not keep treating until they're a few days or weeks from death. As a nurse I've seen *so many* patients have their last period of time on earth ruined by aggressive treatment that I feel pretty sure the docs wouldn't allow to be done to themselves, and the patient wouldn't have accepted had they truly understood what they were signing up for.

The public sees MAT as ""trading one addiction for another"" and it sounds better if we transition patients to non-opioid treatments, despite the risks and benefits of the therapy.

The one thing that is hardest to accept for me is if a patient dies because of a complication of treatment when I argued against the treatment from the start. In those cases I feel like I failed to explain the reality of what they were demanding. They could have had a few good weeks at home, but they died after a few days in a hospital.

Other than that, I don't feel down about my job.

medicine,"Well, I have feet in all those worlds interestingly enough.  You're going to need more than just the EMR techs because some of the Alexa/Google Voice programming is quite complicated especially if you start down the path of natural language processing.  Having said that, most organizations are looking for a way to differentiate themselves with patients and providers to attract both as well as getting into the media.  Ideally this would be something that is suggested either to a group that focuses on innovation within I.S. or to an clinical executive that is very forward thinking.  The justification almost makes the case on it's own once you've got their attention, better press gainey, possibly reduced man hours, improved accuracy of documentation as well as quality of care.  Reduce OFI's (or whatever u call them), may even be a HIMMS tie in which administrators like.  The EMR techs SHOULD be happy to work with it if they have the assistance of the kind of trained programmers that can manage the voice side of things for them.  The other major question is whether or not the EHR is ready to receive the commands, but I'm fairly certain it's workable.  From there, once you've got their attention it's a matter of working through the project details like how many what variety of skills(command lines) etc are you going to develop.  At the end of the day it's unlikely you'll be able to accomodate every single command line that's possible so you'll have to accept that a certain amount of documentation is going to have to be done the old way.

One other thing that we're finding out our organization when we work on these kinds of ""likely to scare the nurses"" ideas is that it really helps to implement it with a small pilot group so that you can show everyone else that the world didn't end when someone used it.  It can be very helpful to your EMR teams if you have buy-in from a proposed pilot group in advance."

medicine,"Yeah. Looking at the first part of the article, it’s a solid argument underneath, but there’s a ton of sensationalization. For example, describing a cervical exam as “trying to forcefully widen the cervix” is sensationalism, when the initial problem of a doctor coming in without saying a word to the patient seems to be put on the backburner. That is a problem, there’s no need to sensationalize it and say he was trying to rip open her cervix (that’s how non-medical people will read it).  

They have the doula saying only one percent of women receive the care they need. I’d also disagree with that. Most women receive the care they need, it’s the manner in which some interactions are that’s a problem, and then a minority where physicians do unnecessary procedures. But I haven’t heard any classmates mention witnessing unnecessary episiotomies, I know I never did (I didn’t witness any episiotomies), so to frame it as if 99% of OBGYNs are assholes who just want to either tear your stomach apart or rip your vagina apart is a little excessive. 

Then they go from one paragraph talking about a horrific sexual assault to the next paragraph having an OBGYN saying these problems are because of men, when like a paragraph or two earlier she has a comment about people saying they’ve seen it from both genders, both young and older OBGYNs, and basically from every demographic you can think of. It’s just so absurd, and I feel like the writer just wants to stir controversy with that statement.

In case you're wondering, defense spending is 20.1% of the total budget.  That's insane.  As for comparing total defense spending, we spend, depending upon the sources for spending, about (probably slightly less than) three times more on defense than our closest rival: China."

medicine,"You pay for loans after tax. If you live on 100k, then your 100 extra becomes 40k available for loans. That’s 8 years to pay of 300k, not factoring interest. 

If you make 400k, then that extra 300 becomes 150, so when your 300 becomes 400 after interest you need 3 years.

medicine,"Burn out because every hospital decision is evaluated economically -- every hospital physician can plan on the daily meeting with case managers/social workers to find out which patients ""meet criteria"".  

You might ask what does ""meet criteria"" mean.  I tell the social worker that I can't discharge a 90 year old woman with painful rib fractures because she lives alone and won't be able to take care of herself.  The social work says she doesn't ""meet criteria"" to have her hospital care paid for by Medicare. 

The patient is discharged, and comes back a day later with a fever.  The social worker confronts me -- ""why is she back?"", she doesn't ""meet criteria"".  I say, but she has pneumonia now as consequence of her rib fractures and immobility.  The social worker proceeds to give me a high five -- my patient now ""meets criteria"".  

It's a sick system. "
medicine,"Well thank you. It was very eye-opening to see how several of her pain management docs just gave her opioids and booted her out without looking into exactly why she was in pain. Her last doc figured it out within  10 minutes of her first appointment with him.

It was nice to learn about Seroquel causing hyperglycemia too. I found out it has also been linked to DKA in some cases. Not exactly fun stuff, but it was a learning experience for sure."
medicine,"Thiamine is the main cofactor in pyruvate dehydrogenase, transketolase, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. It's also most present in the heart, and the heart *loves* using pyruvate as an energy source. There's also been a few trials here and there showing IV sodium lactate might be cardioprotective, because it provides the heart with more fuel.

We often think of elevated lactic acid as this terrible thing in sepsis, but it's often a symptom of a larger problem, and if the body has the ability to *utilize it*, then it partially just means more fuel for the body to use (as long as the body can buffer the acidosis part, or excrete the acids). Lactate is a nutrient the body uses for fuel, and that's important to remember.

There's a pulmcrit article on it that sort of talks about that. It's more concerning if someone has a low/normal lactic acid, their pressure is in the toilet, and they're not making urine; than if someone has an elevated lactate, they're still peeing, and their body is compensating and their pressures are still normal. One means the body is failing and not mounting a stress response, the other means the body is going ""oh crap, I need to do things for energy!"" and they might very well be fluid responsive and recover."

medicine,"A research project: So we had researchers with ipad/timers follow the doctors around the hospital.  The hospital doctors spent 18% of their time with patients.  The hospital doctors spent 50% of their time with computer (EMR).  We shared this data with the administration -- the admin said ""so?""

Computer systems (EMR) are really inventory/billing systems and the doctors have been added on at the back end, like a pimple on the back side of a rhinoceros. Every kid's ipad game is better designed than the most sophisticated doctor's electronic medical record (EMR) program.

Wormser and Imugen states that Steeres IgG detection rate was only 15%. I don’t know

medicine,"&gt;Oh, come on. You can't seriously argue that a few small-scale conflicts around the world is remotely comparable to the rest of human history in good faith.

I'm not the one who claimed we have world peace.

&gt;Which is paid through the defense budget. What, you think all of that is free?

Nuclear weapons makes up around 10 billion of our 600 billion dollar military budget while being the factor that provides for most of our defense from war.

&gt;Military conflicts adapt to changing circumstances. Nobody can go to war in 2018 against a nuclear power. However, they can go to ""totally-not-war"" and annex Crimea. 

Like I said, dick waving. Russia takes out their dick and slaps it on the corner of ukraine, or georgia, or some other impoverished nation that can't fight back, the US bombs Assad over a war he has already won. It's grown adults showing how big their testicles are by murdering people.


&gt;Do you have one? Didn't think so.

I don't have the education to know what the right answer is, but it's much easier to point out how something is wrong.

&gt;It's hard not to read the OP as ""military spending is a waste"". Go back and reread it. I disagree that it's a waste. 

That's fine, but you don't make the argument that military spending isn't a waste by pointing out that X other thing is a waste. That's what I was getting at.

&gt;You might not understand it because the DoD does its damn job and you don't have to worry about war!

Again, you're making assumptions. Things are the way they are, we have a strong military, therefore the military is responsible for good things. That's not a valid line of reasoning and you're more than intelligent enough to know it.

&gt;That's an extremely simplistic analysis. Steven Pinker wrote a book about it I believe. I can find it if you want. There are other hypothesises which I'm much more inclined to believe.

You can believe whatever hypotheses you want, but attacking others from a point of surety based on those hypothesis is what I have a problem with.

medicine,"I think it's kind of strange to proactively look patients up, out of interest of their personal/daily life. If it's done out of concern or professional motivation, then that seems fine. 

In this situation, it could be that the nurse was told about the Gofundme by the patient or a visitor, which i also think is fine. I haven't ever looked up a patient's social media, but if someone mentions to me their company, employer, website or fundraiser that sounds interesting then it's pretty innocent to look those up. "

medicine,"You can estimate osmolarity with the formula (2xNa + Glucose + Urea) all in mmol/L and I find this correlates fairly closely with the measured plasma osmolality. Glucose contributes to the osmolality so controlling the rate at which you lower glucose based on your insulin rate is effectively doing the same thing. "
medicine,"I was on wards a few months ago and we had a pt w/ literally textbook BPPV. We were getting absolutely slammed that day on call so our senior resident basically phoned in the work up based on the chart after popping his head at the ED. 

The pt had multiple co-morbidities and risk factors for CVA and a recent history of stroke and some residual focal findings so his workup made sense based on the report from the ED and from what could be elicited from a short pt interview. But I mean he really went all out (I'm talking MRI angiography, I mean the whole 9). 

The attending we're working with is from the military and super intense about not ordering tests indiscriminately. A few hours later we're rounding on this lady down in ED holding and we finally talk to this lady for more 2 mins. 

Dizziness upon standing, worse with position change, goes away in a minute or two, yada yada yada. So the attending performs dix hapike bedside and this lady had the most apparent nystagmus I'd ever seen. I mean we should have videoed this lady it was textbook.

Get info from people who currently work there. Start listing questions you wish you had asked before. Write up what you want in a organization to have job satisfaction.

This will be a blip in your rear view mirror later I promise.

And yes, it seemed to me that many commentators initially seemed to think that the author was claiming that Alfie was allowed to die due to care rationing, when in fact the author actually notes the opposite- that it would have been far better HAD alfie died from care rationing.  That was the nuance I was referring to initially.

Nonetheless, I still disagree that the court got it right.  As the author broadly states, everything Alder Hey hospital did was fine and just- except for preventing the parents from transferring the kid to another set of doctors in Italy.

Look, I don't know about the author, but I'm not some right wing nutjob.  I actually deeply respect the NHS and what it represents.  Nonetheless, I was deeply troubled by what happened here, and in talking to many of my colleagues they felt the same way: it was fine for the Alder Hey physicians to refuse to continue invasive treatments.  It was not fine to refuse to allow the parents to transfer care to another set of doctors.  I acknowledge that the author here made the case imperfectly, and I don't agree with all of it, but it was the first mainstream piece I found that really put forward that position.

That said, I understand its a difficult issue, and I respect those across the Atlantic who disagree."

No one asks for cannabis to be what works.  I'm tired of being a lab rat for big pharma, 20\+ different prescriptions and none worked, many caused many worse problems.  Cannabis oil is what works, high CBD, low THC.  It's the answer to autism but it's so hard to reach people that this is real medicine because of the stupid stigma.  I wish a pill worked, I've been doing what doctors have told me to for my entire life.  I finally find what works and it's illegal for god knows why as it doesn't even harm the user.  Not talking about 25&amp;#37; THC recreational stuff you would smoke.  I just feel that after 20 prescriptions over 20 years I deserve cannabis at this point.  I still will get a felony for planting one CBD strain like Charlottes Web that's 100&amp;#37; medicinal with zero high.  A felony.  Or suffer..  My doctor says if I quit the meds I'll end up dead.  Idk, but the anti\-depressants do far more harm to my head than anything else in life.  It makes you think about bad things.  And why are they so addictive?

It’s just as easy to abuse intranasal ketamine as it is to tamper with SL troches and capsules compounding pharmacies use, so giving less total quantity by rx’ing intranasal ketamine is the appropriate decision. 

It is also cheaper as it is faster to mix saline and bulk ketamine powder in a vial and put in a nasal spray applicator. 

I don’t have much sympathy for a person unwilling to use a medicine intranasally; they can learn (I teach them how to use it in the office and they get immediate relief, which creates a positive feedback loop).

medicine,"A more controversial question is whether chemoprophylaxis meaningfully alters risk of serious VTE?

All the studies that led to widespread adoption measured mostly asymptomatic lower limb DVT, and I am of the view that chemoprophylaxis is overused based on protocol-driven medicine which has come to dominate our practice. 

It has a role, but I don’t agree it should be blindly prescribed for all-comers, as most of the bureaucrats would like. 

Nor am I convinced it necessarily reduces PE except in select minority groups (surgical, orthopaedic, CCF, acute infection etc). 

I don’t use it in my epileptics, for example. Nor in strokes - we use pneumatic calf compressors instead. 

I do, however, agree with you that people in CCF should probably be prophylaxed - perhaps it’s worth you doing a literature review and presenting at your unit meetings? 

I’m obviously not a heart guy, but I’d be curious to hear if there is any data in the NSTEMI population who are usually mobile and only briefly in hospital. I’d tend to think any benefit would be small and outweighed by bleeding risk?

Edit: I should clarify that I don’t think it’s entirely useless, but I’m very circumspect about a therapy that become almost universally recommended after drug-company sponsored trials showed benefit only for surrogate endpoints and without showing improved mortality. I see at least 1 patient a year die from complications of prophylactic clexane, I just wish it was clearer in the literature that it’s use was saving lives and not just giving us the illusion of control over thromboembolism, which is inevitably the end stage of so many medical conditions, regardless of treatment.

One page is plenty. Give us time to respond. If we don't respond in 5, 10, 15, or even 30 minutes we are likely very busy. For example seeing a patient for an admit or dealing with a patient who requires our immediate attention. Please don't page multiple times in a short period of time, unless a patient is acutely decompensating. Not for pain meds. Not for Tylenol. Not to come speak to family for the 5th time. Not to tidy up orders. Yes, the pager is working. We are trying to prioritize our time. If you don't hear back from us after 30-45 minutes, page again. 

There's one particular unit I deal with and their nurses are frankly awful with distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent, they abuse the pager system. I'll get 3 pages in ten minutes for a pain med. We've completely stopped taking pages from that unit seriously, no longer treating hammer pages as urgent. Of course it's bit us in the ass once so far with real emergent problem with no residents responding because that same nurse also overhead announced us to the whole hospital stat for absolute nonsense earlier that day. 

So please, page appropriately. We want to help you and the patients but look at the bigger picture for urgent vs non urgent paging, it makes our lives so much better. Thanks"

medicine,"I was PM'ed the following message and I figured I would write my response publicly to better explain my rationale for using atropine. 

""Hey, I saw your comment regarding us of atropine in inferior MI and was wondering what your rationale was behind using it specifically in inferior MI, or if you use it in all types.""

Bradycardia and heart block are common in inferior/posterior MI and often occurs as a result of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. This is a strong parasympathetic response that is triggered by cardiac mechanoreceptors and chemo receptors which are activated during inferior MI, among other causes. The bradycardia and hypotension due to this reflex can usually be easily reversed with vagolytics such as atropine. Chronotropic meds are much less effective and may actually be harmful in this circumstance. This is in contrast to hypotension during anterior MI that is due to cardiogenic shock. This scenario is usually accompanied by tachycardia and treatment may require inotropes and mechanical support. "
medicine,"The stigma towards mental health is well known. Psychiatric patients can be time consuming and unreliable historians. Sometimes it seems I am consulted in psychiatry to be the first to listen to the patient — and gather collateral history from the family. There really are physicians who do not *sit* and listen to their patients. Sitting and listening is extremely productive to almost every conscious adult; it calms emotions, improves rapport, builds an alliance, and generates history.

Anecdotes like this one in the NEJM lead to Monday morning quarterbacking like mine, but odds are this patient encountered mostly good doctors who took a patient off. It seems to me medicine rarely looks good in the mirror. "

Some of them believe that they got through it because they are stronger or that the adversity makes you stronger. So they tell the younger generation to suck it up or wash out while unaware of how truly difficult the process has become. 

The worst part is when I see people that were recently licensed harboring these sentiments. I have friends that just recently became attendings that now think they are vastly superior to the students and residents they once were and are unmoved by the plight of their younger counterparts. It angers me to no end how they ignore or now perpetuate the mistreatment they themselves received.

The entrenched hierarchical system and match process gives the institutions and attendings a disproportionate amount of power which significantly contributes to students not speaking out of fear of retaliation and lacking the power to actually change a despotic and over-stressed system.

Patients seem to prefer the inpatient floor option, but does that outweigh the risks? 

I don't really have a good answer here, but I'd be curious to know what your opinion is. Thankfully, we don't run into this situation too often in our facility any more, but I know it's something a lot of hospitals deal with. "

medicine,"Written by a urologist, as part of The Atlantic's ""Human Capital"" section.

medicine,"Where do you work that admins are regularly making $200k? Outside of the C-suite, admins with a masters and 10-15 years of experience make like $80k-$100k. It's not bad money, but it's generally less than what you can make in a comparable job in a different sector and generally comes with more responsibility and a lot less vitriol from the people you work with. 

FWIW I fully support hospitals having fitness areas. They're great for morale and wellness. "
medicine,"With regards to statins - Diabetics are more or less all high risk.

The older data basically said that DM in and of itself is a CAD equivalent - your chance of having an MI as a diabetic individual without a prior event was more or less equivalent to the chance of someone without DM who has had one prior MI. Newer data isn't quite as bad (likely due to better treatment of comorbid conditions IMO), but DM is still a high risk category. The ADA's stance is that that means every single diabetic above 40 should be put on a statin - they're the medications with the most robust data with regards to prevention of real events.

ACC/AHA, AACE, and other lipid guidelines agree with this - diabetics are universally treated as a group where (barring a naturally *low* LDL, which is defined differently place to place) you need at least a moderate intensity statin.

With regards to ASA, the ADA just says that if you are &gt;50 and have other major risk factors (HTN, smoking, albuminuria), you can use it for primary prevention. Honestly, if you apply the other guidelines, more or less 100% of diabetic men over 50 meet criteria for an ASCVD risk &gt;7.5% anyway, so the ADA actually recommends aspirin for fewer men than the other societies do (and the opposite for women)."
medicine,"That's important if you care about hourly pay. In this case, it seems like assuming everyone is being paid for 40 hours per week. Is that how many hours everyone works? No. For physicians is that going to provide a more accurate estimate of income? Yes. Whether we work 40 hours or 100 per week we're still making the same amount outside of private practice."
medicine,"This is essentially an impossible question to answer since everyone values things differently.  However, in general I have found the following formula hold true fairly well:

We should all be working to support vaccine development and vaccination campaigns.

But the fear of market response may be retarding work. 

"
medicine,"That’s fine. Phase I trials still sometimes do detect some benefit, but mostly you’re just hoping it doesn’t cause immediate death. Remember these are people that are terminally ill to begin with. 

I see now the bill only allows treatment for terminally ill with drugs that have phase I trial results. I actually would favor going further. Those that are terminally ill should be allowed to take investigational drugs that have any peer reviewed papers (you could slightly restrict this to relatively “reputable” journals) supporting their use.

We allow people to parachute into other countries and risk their lives. Why should taking investigational drugs be different?

**I personally, if faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis, would gladly take an experimental drug to treat it. Regardless of personal benefit (or indeed harm), I see it in a sense as a patriotic duty. I have benefited from other people in clinical trials that have gone wrong, and so in a way I can give back. Far more people have died from cancer than nazis after all.**

The main consideration in my mind is to eliminate any financial conflicts of interest that would result in unscrupulous individuals making money hand over fist downplaying risks and exaggerating benefits.

If the patient knows the risks (and there are plenty of terminally ill people capable of understanding those risks) then I see no issue.

There are many good books about the frustrations dealing with an inability to get some cancer drugs in the US that are approved only in Europe, but haven’t been approved yet in the US or vice versa. A patient once told me he felt like he wanted to strangle his oncologist after he was told only the standard of care would be offered, given that (at the time) his diagnosis of gbm was effectively universally fatal. "
medicine,"That's one of the biggest differences between nurses and physicians--if a nurse wants to make some extra cash, they can pick up some extra shifts. Doctors can't do that, unless they happen to have some free time to moonlight somewhere else. 

I also strongly disagree with OPs assumption that the average PCP works 40hrs/week and still makes $200k--they're not factoring call, rounding on inpatients, and extra charting requirements that physicians do without tracking hours. "

medicine,"That's an excellent point. I recall taking care of a few patients with complex congenital heart disease who's cases could arguably be described as futile. In fact, one surgical service did not consider the infant to be a candidate while my institution did. 

His case is ongoing, but his prognosis appears rather bleak. Still, I respect the decision for physicians, families, and institutions to have open-ended and fair discussions including futility.

However, in the setting of two institutions and two physician groups disagreeing on medical futility, would it not be fair to permit a patient (assuming the receiving facility would bear the burden of the costs) to seek the second opinion?"
medicine,"&gt; financial harm

I don't think financial harm to the patient was even remotely the concern with transferring this patient out (and indeed there are some issues regarding the individuals and extremist groups driving the fundraising), but rather the patient's right to a) live a life free of unnecessary pain and b) a dignified death.

Imagine for a moment that this were a 105 year old multi-morbid ventilator-dependent brainstem-dead granny with invasive lines and pressure sores everywhere and an assumed existence of little more than discomfort (if not frank pain) with an advance directive stating she did not wish to undergo futile procedures. Would you have in moral conscience put that lady on a helicopter to a foreign country because her children wished it so, knowing that it was entirely futile and that all that was planned to be provided it Italy was palliative care which was already being offered in the existing setting? Because if you reverse the age and sex, that's basically this child.

In the UK (and ECHR), children are not the property of their parents but instead have individual rights including the assumed right not to undergo unnecessary procedures. We wouldn't have offered Alfie chemotherapy for his condition or, say, deliberately infected him with rabies because it would be a) inappropriate, b) distressing, c) probably painful, and d) would not provide him with an improved quality of life. The same goes for transfer to another country - it would be a wildly inappropriate, distressing, painful undertaking with no medical merit.

Setting aside emotion for a moment, this child was effectively little more than a collection of cells being artificially hydrated, oxygenated, and nourished with no hope for recovery. It's hideously sad but true. Any existing or future sapient life was sadly extinguished earlier on in his disease and continuing to treat, in my opinion, would have been cruel. The vitriol and at times deliberate misrepresentation of this case the media is just another manifestation of increasing emotional misinformation campaigns and some parties certainly stood to gain financially from polarising the discussion."

medicine,"For most uncomplicated knees at least, early post-op radiographs aren't indicated anymore, or at least that's what I've been taught. The most recent [JACR](https://www.jacr.org/article/S1546-1440\(17\)31091-8/fulltext#sec2.1.1) criteria do not support routine radiographs in asymptomatic patients, as they don't give much meaningful information, they [don't predict outcomes](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/afe4/35e9a57a607f3e49187056b7fbd8ed843bb8.pdf) and they're [not very cost-effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10884208). 

The rate of finding otherwise asymptomatic peri-prosthetic fractures or abnormalities is pretty dang low, and the rate of finding *operative* abnormalities approaches zero. 

The best evidence we have shows that early mobilization and discharge of THA/TKA patients is one of the most important ways to reduce complications and improve outcomes. Anything that impedes that should be really carefully considered.

I disagree with a paternalistic approach, but the reason doctors are paid as professionals is because we literally DO know best, over layperson opinion and speculation.

I have personally intervened in stopping a code on a patient of mine with motor neurone disease, whose family had not come to terms with DNR. 

But that’s because they were grieving, not because they genuinely thought he had a real shot at life after CPR. 

We must allow people their grief, but we are not obliged to provide medical care that is not consistent with best practice. CPR is most definitely poor medical practice in futile situations, and it saddens me that the US has such a fear of legalities that excessive care is offered in such a way. "

"
medicine,"Again, this simply shows you can't interpret evidence and don't actually read and critically appraise papers. Probably because you believe what random conspiracy theorists have told you these papers say. Link 1 is discussing mutated protein targets, essentially vaccine resistant strains. No vaccine will ever be perfect. It has nothing to do with a poor response to vaccination.

 Link 2 is a similar statement in an ancient study from the 1950s in animals. 

Link 3 is a hodgepodge of random papers for your search terms, none of which seem to be at all related to the properties ""dangers of injecting triacylated lipoproteins"". Point me to a paper in that list of 30 that actually even has relevance in this conversation. I'm not seeing a single one. 

Link 4 doesn't have anyone getting chewed out. It has a couple of patients tell sob stories that aren't verified to be linked to vaccination in any way. The FDA even discusses at length that their stories are at odds with the original study data and postmarket data. The reported adverse event ratio of relevant issues (I.e. Inflammatory arthritis) are similar to the baseline in the placebo group. The FDA then laments that they aren't enrolling patients in the prospective cohort study looking to disprove this effect because the media circus had made vaccination rates, and thus study enrolment, plummet. They discuss changing the labelling on the vaccine but can't even agree that's a good idea based on the utter lack of proof.

medicine,"I don’t want you to perceive this as I don’t think teachers or those in hospitals shouldn’t be appropriately compensated but if we are being philosophical...two things...
1)”maximum possible potential” is a little vague... potential for what and is this relative or absolute? Some may view maximum potential inclusive of putting someone in the right physical location or give them the exposure to the right marketplace or remove any (unjustified) bias that may exist that can have any (unjustified) influence on their maximum potential. IMO maximum potential would be a situation where there is no potential barriers as well. Education/knowledge/wisdom is only one dimension... maximum access to other resources and opportunity is also very important in achieving “max possible potential”. I get your point that we should have the best people teaching but I’ll bite... teaching what?
2) While I know where I’m posting, and it might be an unpopular opinion, I don’t believe hospitals should be the “temple” that you speak. The real temple should be based on something that prevents or dramatically reduces the need for the hospital. Is the hospital typically someplace the layperson wants to go if they don’t have to? Again don’t get me wrong that the hospital worker is very valuable and and important serves to improve/resolve problems or to prevent bad problems from becoming worse, but IMO we should “praise” those who can effectively prevent the big problems in the first place more than those who depend on big problems.  If we are aligned with our calling shouldn’t we as healthcare workers be trying to put ourselves out of a job, rather than trying to entrench it?

In reality I think there are negative consequences with just increasing salary... a big one being you attract more people to it that are doing it more for the salary than their passion/desire to do it. Not everyone is this way but those attracted to more money will be attracted to more money. You get teachers teaching for a paycheck and looking for ways to create a need for more specialized teaching that pays them more or healthcare workers migrating to niche specialities with high cost procedures/services that they want to establish as the standard of care or broaden the population that should get said expensive procedure/service.

I’m totally with you that putting the incentives in the right places is very important but ensuring that we are not putting the incentives in the wrong places is just as important."

Follow up in several weeks, no change in symptoms. Assumed patient must have missed the rash and it’s just post-herpetic neuralgia, prescribed gabapentin and told to follow up. 

Follow up several weeks again, “okay maybe it’s a radiculopathy.” Referred to ortho and given 8 weeks physical therapy.

Referrals to detox, doctors who can prescribe suboxone, etc can all bridge people who want a change. But housing and long term treatment are also usually issues. Here it’s 5 weeks at least to get into residential treatment so people get kicked out of detox after a few days and have to wait (maybe with a home, maybe with a phone to hear when they get a bed)... it’s hard as heck to get supports when most addicts have burned their bridges with their social supports."

medicine,"Terrible idea. It would be extremely challenging, and you would lose at least 4-6 years of your income for taking coursework to apply to medical school and then to attend medical school. Even then, you would be on residency until you are about 40 years old. All just so that you can do the same job but with more responsibility, liability, and stress, and worse hours. 

If you have to become a doctor, then you can definitely accomplish it. But I would do everything you can to convince yourself you don’t want to do medicine because it’s a terrible idea. 

Proof: I am a medical student $300k in debt in my mid 20s. I will work my ass off for the next 6 years to become a doctor making $300k a year and being stressed. My friend is a PA with no debt making $150k a year with very little stress working 8-5. I prob should have become a PA"

It's an interesting idea that just isn't supported by the numbers and a few hundred physicians out of the 1+ million practicing providers in the US is not evidence to the contrary.

medicine,"This seems like it's gone off the rails.

Whether the semantics of calling residency an apprenticeship or not fits, and whether an apprenticeship is a subcategory of job or a job\-like but different thing, doesn't really matter to me. Does it to you?

I don't know the history, but I'm guessing there was some perception of disparagement of residents, or their willingness to work, or their lack of recognition of the importance of harsh, grueling training. All of that doesn't depend at all on what residency is in terms of categorization and has everything to do with what it is in practice.

...So please, guys, argue about what you actually want to argue about, not an adjacent but irrelevant topic.

\[Edited: spelling\]"
medicine,"That's fine. No one says there's no reason to look into whether doctors are fit to practice.

medicine,"At my center albumin is very discouraged as there is no good data to show it is superior to Crystalloids. It is more expensive, it is a blood product and it's not better \(so why use it if there are only downsides\). The only time it would be considered is someone with Cirrhosis and even them some of my critical care staff are cynical. The only EBM proven use of albumin as far as I am aware of is large volume paracentesis, SBP, and HRS \(I could well be forgetting some other ones\). 

Another user here indicates they use it in CHF to get expansion with low volume. As far as I know this isn't entirely the case. For volume expansion and oncotic manipulation to work effectively your albumin level should be low. ie you don't get good bang for your buck giving someone who has a normal albumin level albumin.

And further to this point if someone has CHF but NEEDS fluid resuscitation then you resuscitate them. Assuming they are full code and they are critically ill \(ie septic shock\) you do not worry about their CHF if they need fluids. 

As a rule of thumb always go cyrstalloid first. If they are bleeding to death obviously give them emerg blood. 

If you want to look at a few trials on this check out wikijournalclub. They have great summaries of big trials. One of which is the Albios trial which showed no difference in mortality at 28d with patients in septic shock/sepsis who received daily albumin vs not. [https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/ALBIOS](https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/ALBIOS)

As for blood transfusion targets because this has been mentioned general rule is 7 \(unless massively hemorrhaging\). One of the main reasons for the cardiac target being higher isn't that it's been shown to be better but that ACS patients are excluded from these trials. [https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/TRISS](https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/TRISS) and [https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/Transfusion\_Strategies\_for\_Acute\_Upper\_Gastrointestinal\_Bleeding](https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/Transfusion_Strategies_for_Acute_Upper_Gastrointestinal_Bleeding). We use 9 here for cardiac patients although it's not adhered to 100&amp;#37;. For everything else though 7 is pretty standard practice for transfusion unless someone is chronically borderline 6.5\-7 or if they may be getting a transplant of some sort in the near future. 

Lastly, you might come across the everlasting debate of which cyrstalloid. Ringers vs NS.There's some VERY recent trials in NEJM. SALT\-EM based in emergency departments showed no difference but that balanced crystalloids had lower rates of kidney injury. ie if your patient has renal failure maybe RL is better. The latest one is in critically ill patients: [http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wpln/files/201802/smart\_proof\_\-\_nejmoa1711584.pdf](http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wpln/files/201802/smart_proof_-_nejmoa1711584.pdf). Here there is a statistically significant primary outcome of kidney event in 30days. Mortality/CRRT both trended towards significance in the balanced crystalloid group \(p=0.06 and 0.08 respectively\). \-\-\-\-\-\-so really there isn't a huge difference. Use RL if they have renal problems, use RL if you are gonna use a TON of fluids \(IMO\). But at the start it's not a big deal. 

Sorry this is a long post...im on ICU atm and we've had a few of these pop up in Journal club the last month or so. If there are any errors let me know! "

medicine,"I wasn't saying you need to jump to invasive tests every time someone has chest pain. The guy above me asked what the indications were for CTA, cath, or stress, and I simply responded those aren't the only options, and for some patients exactly like this guy, I see patients admitted for observation in the COU. For this particular patient, I don't disagree with sending him home, but depending on a number of different factors, someone with the same test results might be admitted. Like if they didn't have anyone at home to keep an eye on them, lived a long distance away, or were extremely mistrustful of the health care system and were unlikely to return and spend the better part of a thousand dollars only to be told it's nothing (from their perspective). If you're serious about wanting to bitch at someone for that, then feel free to call the ED attendings at my hospital.

Also seriously, dude, dial back the snark. I already acknowledged my lack of expertise, and there's no need for you to do your best House impression."
medicine,"Thanks for your response again. There may have been some miscommunication between the ID team and the surgeon, I'm sure this is common. My understanding was that the surgeon had told the ID consultant that the patient wouldn't have the operation because they had already had two and he didn't believe in doing another one, and not for any specific clinical reason.

I'm still not really clear on the distinction between making the decision on clinical grounds or ethical grounds. If the patient is not 'fit' for surgery due to anaesthetic risk, operative complexity, futility of outcome etc then I don't have any objection to not operating.

But if the question is one of resource allocation then I think that's an ethical question which needs to be resolved with an ethical framework. In this case I'm not sure that the framework that seems to get used (you've already had x operations so you can't have another one) is really sufficient. 

Also, if it is a question of resource allocation, is it really the most pressing example of overspending in the hospital? There are many patients who don't have any years of productive life expected (either too old, or too young and sick), or any reasonable prospect of long term recovery who nonetheless have large amounts of money spent on them. "
medicine,"It’s probably safe to say that anything that isn’t air is probably not good for your lungs.

In my job in the private sector where I have far less flexibility as compared to my job in the public sector (in terms of scheduling, frequency, etc); I certainly don't feel like I can effectively give severely depressed patients the kind of attention they would require, speaking in terms of the kinds of depressions that have an indication for hospitalisation, but where alternatives are being sought out.

medicine,"Is his blood plasma the original source for the necessary antibody to be identified or is his blood plasma the only source of the antibody? 

Because isolation of the antibody in question and production via recombinant methods should be readily doable and would obviate the need for one man to donate so much blood. I couldn't find out from any of the news articles about this individual case.

Beyond that, the fact that people are not financially compensated (at least in USA) for whole blood donations is still mind boggling to me. Any argument about misaligned incentives with money for blood donation has yet to convince me but I would be curious to hear why it's a bad idea besides making blood distributors less money."
medicine,"Because that’s the whole point of a market. Where everyone who participated in a situation like this benefits. The company benefitted by getting their message out and the physician and staff benefitted by learning and getting lunch. The other alternative is taxes or physician fees finding such education, but when you can get a company to do it on their own why wouldn’t you chose that? Especially when you can regulate it so much that all parties can agree that what took place was ethical from all parties standpoints. This is clearly the ideal situation and what we should all strive for. Far better than outright bans and far better than unregulated business as usual.

If the company is presenting about a drug that was already approved by the FDA through strict guidelines and what they present is consistent with those guidelines and focuses on approved indications and peer reviewed data, what’s wrong with that? It’s not like you’d be letting any company present about any shot they want. It’d have to be about something FDA approved, and it’s hard to argue that a physician shouldn’t be learning about new drugs on the market. As long as the presentation is regulated and required to share all results and both sides then what’s the problem? If a drug doesn’t have a proven benefit then that’s the fault of the FDA, not the physicians or pharma reps."
medicine,"This happens because inpatient nurses are in charge of patients inside specific rooms. The patients frequently change throughout our shifts as they are admitted and discharged, but we remain assigned to the same rooms. This is unlike physicians, who follow the patients on their service, no matter what room they are in. Of course you should never just get a room number, as that is recipe for trouble. Over the phone, it's room and patient full name. Over pages, it's room and patient initials. "

medicine,"Except the benefit with tPA is mild. tPA does not make patients go from PEG/Trach dependent to fully independent/functional, sorry it’s just not THAT effective.

The biggest problem I have with the stroke literature is the definition of a favorable outcome and the tool with which we classify that, namely the MRS.
Also, looking out to 90 days for functional outcome is too early since many patients experience gains well after that.

The beauty of medicine is that we can look at the same trial (WAKE UP) and see aspects that bolster our respective positions. I see WAKE UP and note the over 300% increase in death and 500% increase in ICH while the MRS score goes from 2 to 1 (Ooooooooo let’s pop out the champagne!)


A good analogy is found in poker (in fact the fundamental nature of medicine is akin to a game of no limit) you should never risk your entire chip stack for a few more chips. This is the gamble we play with tPA and it’s the wrong call.

(Your point about using tPA with thrombectomy adds nothing to the discussion about tPA alone. Anytime one instruments within the vasculature, we know the pipes need to be greased up)

Yes it’s anecdotal, but it did happen. If you don’t believe me that’s fine. Did you see how many facilities are available for Medicaid patients? So first you claim there aren’t any due to insurance  reasons. I provide a link that disproves that, now you claim the state funded programs aren’t as good. I’m inclined to believe that but do you have sources? Also while yes they may not be as successful (assuming this is true) as private rehab facilities, there is still AN option for Medicaid patients. 

How would you suggest we fix this problem? I’m sure we can find common ground on that. Have private payers provide more coverage for rehab? I would support that but I would guess most/Majority of substance abusers are uninsured or on Medicaid. So push rehab facilities to accept more Medicaid patients? I think a conversation on that would be interesting, but I can think of one issue.  That issue is still providing a high quality/level of care with premium services with the low fee schedules of Medicaid. "

No, probably not, but that level usually is not causing acute issues either. The problem is that most MDs have no idea what a hyperkalemia ECG looks like outside of peaked T-waves. 

As for K levels and ECG changes, the progression of the ECG changes is fairly reliable; however, the level at which these changes start vary significantly from person to person."

medicine,"Sure, but that's kind of my point. While it seems like we have different political leanings, I think the issue is that this other stuff is distracting. People want to hear about it. If talking about tax reform or trade deals was more interesting to the average citizen, we'd be hearing about that instead. Regardless if you think the media has a political agenda, it's still made up of private companies trying to make money, so I'm not surprised they give as much coverage as they do to scandalous stories which people want to hear more, but still I agree with your point there's more benefit to policy discussion. Unfortunately this administration is very good at churning out flubs, unforced errors, and scandals to be talked about, so I don't expect any pivot on this."

medicine,"A friend who was hospitalized for depression many years ago once described to me that part of the benefit of hospitalization was somewhat the *lack* of structure. Care was provided, but otherwise there weren't really expectations. You were discouraged from staying in bed all day, but there wasn't any consequence to engaging or disengaging. As a kind of holding pattern she found it very helpful for a relatively brief period of exacerbation of her depression.

She was also suicidal, which is what bought the admission, but never acted on it and found a several\-day reprieve helpful. So maybe I'm being too harsh on inpatient units by a combination of projecting my own desire not to be in one and too much recent interaction with critics of psychiatry."

They almost inevitably start off with an example of a high priced drug, like the cell therapies Yescarta/Kymriah or one of the HCV drugs, like Harvoni. Imo, these are terrible examples of expensive medicines. I think it is more important that we have a conversation about why we spend &gt;$50 billion a year on Humira (one of the most expensive agents in a crowded, minimally differentiated class).

That said, I am interested in hearing more defined ideas on how to properly recognize NIH funded contributions to drug development. The Varmus example in the article rings true to me - if you start putting in all sorts of caveats about pricing before the product is even developed, all you'll do is stymie innovation."
medicine,"Which is upsetting and, honestly, disgusting.

If the argument for letting somebody die is based solely on cost, we've lost any sense of morals.

Cost is, of course, a factor in medical decision making. But it's outweighed by other factors, including to some degree autonomy and definitely non-malfeasance. 

The ONLY convincing argument regarding Alfie, IMO, is the one that was actually made: prolonging his life was inhumane because it was treating him as an object and demeaning him as a human. It was continuing suffering in the face of futility. There was absolutely nothing that could be done to improve his condition, there was a chance he was suffering, and the act of transferring him to Italy had the potential to cause even more suffering.

If we, as physicians, truly believe in treating life with dignity and respect, and in the goal of reducing suffering, then it's important to focus on these reasons for the decision regarding Alfie. To suggest cost should be the reason is disgusting."

medicine,"I havent heard of many physicians dealing with blunt-trauma arrests in the field, because mainly in my area with these arrests we try to minimize on scene time (if possible) and provide high-speed diesel therapy to the closest trauma center. of all the trauma codes i've dealt with involving auto accidents, we stabilize, load, and go. really no time or sense to wait around for a doc to get there when they're pretty close by to begin with. if any of the trauma centers are backed up, we can divert to any hospital regardless of their designation of a trauma center or not. we can also fly these patients via helicopter to other trauma centers.


I do know of the UMD GO Team (a trauma doc + CRNA) used to provide urgent surgical care to scenes where extrication are going to exceed an hour or ones which are technically challenging in the entrapment of a patient and would probably require extremity amputation (i.e: heavy machinery/industrial accidents).

medicine,"Most people who are quadriplegic have an intact brain and a body that is intact but receiving no signals. There's a conceivable case with e.g. pressure ulcers \(bed sores\) where the body has broken down because of the length of time without input from the brain, and a transplant could help. That is a rare scenario, especially weighed against the likely morbidity and mortality of the transplant.

There's also an order here. Transplanted organs do not have the same longevity or provide the same life expectancy as native organs, in part because of rejection and the risks of anti\-rejection medication. Before doing the same with whole\-body transplant, some gain in lifespan would need to be shown. Rejection would uniquely be against the head, which is the patient, and more like graft vs host disease. What is the risk of killing someone by having the new body's immune system attack and destroy the head and brain of the patient?

medicine,"As for family docs, I think this often comes down to training and comfort. Many FM residencies see only a small proportion of pediatrics, often times only narrowly obtaining the minimum number of pediatric patients required by the ACGME for graduation. This leads to them being less comfortable with peds patients, and over-ordering. 

In FM programs who still have strong OB and do a lot of deliveries, they tend to have higher pediatric clinic populations (if you deliver, they tend to stay with you), so they see more peds patients and are much more comfortable with peds. Unfortunately, most FM programs are delivering less and less, so they are seeing less peds consequently. "

I love The Knick \(TV show\), which was sadly cancelled after 2 series last year, but it depicts turn of the 20th century surgery with tremendous accuracy \(would love to make a film about the show itself one day\). It correctly shows surgical drapes to be white and surgeon's attire as white overalls atop normal clothes. So I got wondering, why did drapes and scrubs change from white to green \(then later blue\)?

We have this exact same problem in the military. The amount of online module training we're required to complete each year is asinine. Everybody knows it's just a way for commanding officers to cover their asses whenever somebody offs themselves, and yet nobody seems to make serious moves to change it and actually empower junior leaders.

medicine,"One key point: why the hell is psychiatry alone in requiring prior authorization before the patient reaches the floor? No other admission is like that. And since EDs have been cutting back on overnight support staff, it's often a delay until morning regardless.

And pushback: if someone is depressed, what good is an inpatient admission? Depression is a long, slow illness and treatment is also slow. With the turnover time of inpatient psychiatry, all that will happen is maybe a few changes in meds, nominally verifying non\-suicidality, and a quick discharge. Depression is, in my experience, better managed while outpatient even when it's severe except in cases where the patient's level of function is impeding ADLs. There are a few inpatient units that exceed that, but urban psychiatry in grim, crowded, high\-acuity units are usually not it. "
medicine,"The problem isnt the negative review. Opinion is protected from defamation suits.

The problem is she called the practice ""crooked"" (I cant find the actual tweet in the article). This is a factual statement that can be evaluated by looking at treatment plans, etc. When you make a factually false statement online it can be interpreted as Libel. Especially calling someone a criminal. Calling someone a criminal is defamation per se, as the reputational harm is self evident. So it meets the requirements of a false statement that causes reputational harm and sufficiently identifies the individual being libeled. 

If she had kept it to opinions, I felt this, I felt that, she would have had a very easy defense; however, she made that claim about the office and its ethics/legal adherence. "

With (discounted) CFTR drug-related costs ranging from $4.9 million to $7.4 million, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of drugs plus best supportive care compared with best supportive care alone *were approximately $0.9 million per QALY for all drugs in all populations considered* [emphasis added]."

Regarding blood and primal urges \- maybe. We're clearly programmed to notice red ahead of other colours. There was a great [Vox film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMqZR3pqMjg) about how multiple cultures were studied to see how many colour names they had.

What they found is that cultures initially evolve light and dark as the most basic colours. But thereafter red always seems to be the first colour to get its own name. It is suggested this \*might\* be due to its importance in survival \- like bleeding \- but we don't know for sure.

They don't call, and if they do set up an appointment they no\-show, and I know that because I was involved in a project trying to track these outcomes. Refer for detox/rehab? Inpatient beds are scarce \(and often these are people who have burned those bridges\), and when intensive outpatient treatment is suggested the patients usually get angry... and when the arrangements are made they no\-show.

These are frustrating patients. We want to help them, but we don't know how to help them. That breeds cynicism as a kind of callus, because if you let your heart bleed a half dozen times per shift you are not going to last long in medicine either.

Again, that's no reason to give up preemptively, but it does mean that when the pattern fits I'm going to be cautious about involving myself or other staff heavily. \(The assaults have mostly been when I have tried to make inpatient referrals and they have not worked out.

medicine,"&gt;I strongly disagree that Israel violated international law, as they were acting properly in defense of their border.

Depends on how you define border. Gaza is not an independent nation, but a semi-autonomous ghetto (some argue it is an open-air prison) that is partially controlled by Israel. 

Edit: 
It becomes a framing issue. Is this a ghetto uprising that was crushed or an transnational border invasion?"

medicine,"This is what I originally wrote that lead to this point: 
&gt; Because if the change is not clinically significant, but truly statistically significant (meaning no p-hacking), then it suggest the change is generalizable to the population, albeit very small, but it is still change.

I'm not saying one way or another whether there was p-hacking or not, but I said if there was no p-hacking, then the results indicate we reject the null hypothesis.  Significance does not tell you whether the effect size is large or not, you rely on the effect size for that.  I am also not denying the effect size is small.  But if we successfully reject the null hypothesis, it means we reject the possibility that the effect size is zero in the population, which is another term for generalizating the findings, because we assume the findings persist in general outside the present sample.

The population is never all people on Earth.  The population consists of the specific category of people the sample was randomly drawn from.  That is what I mean by population.  The individuals in the sample have multiple traits that make them a narrow slice of all people.  Significance means we reject the null as applied to the population of all individuals with these characteristics.  Obviously if we randomly sampled all people on Earth, they would not have all diabetes.  Our sample randomly selects from a subpopulation, which is what you can attribute the findings to.  That is the only thing you are allowed to generalize to when rejecting the null."

medicine,"A patient in the Neuro ICU had aspiration pneumonia and he was started on antibiotics earlier that day.  A repeat CBC came back with a new leukocytopenia.  The Neuro ICU fellow (who did a residency in Neurosurgery) was scratching his head as to why that had happened and when I said “he’s probably septic” he totally dismissed me and said “no, that should make the WBCs go up.”

Ten minutes later, the attending walks in, and I tell him about the WBCs, only for the attending to respond “Oh! He’s septic!” So, that was a nice moment of vindication.

Another day, a patient had a totally flat EEG.  I told the same fellow that the patient was completely burst suppressed, and that I was backing off on sedation.  The fellow insisted I call the EEG fellow to confirm.  I said, “I’m not sure that’s necessary.  Have you looked at the EEG?” (Mind you, this was near the end of his first year as a Neuro ICU fellow). He said “I haven’t, but I don’t know what burst suppression would look like anyway.” "

Do you happen to know what my attending prefers? “Hey, you’re the doctor.” Yeah, no kidding, but if we work together, I can make things easy for both of us. They were almost all night-shift, and they didn’t care if day shift had to order and hang a few different meds.

They are just recently starting to build and save. I know some that just finished paying off student loans. 

My point is that when the ""average"" person starts earning there is a lifestyle creep that happens as well. Its not just keep everything the same and invest all the new cash flow. But once you are earning attending money that $1000 for a new computer/phone is much less of your take home $ then a RN's. and yes lifestyle creep happens to many many physicians too but there is much more wiggle room for them at that point that you can get very comfortable compared to the student life and still be saving/paying down debt wholesale

Also I would hope that when the average physician starts earning at 30 (with that huuuge pile of debt) they would be a little more mature with their money vs a 24y/o. Cause i know how bad i was with my money in the few years a worked between undergrad and medschool. "
medicine,"This conversation is muddied by poor accessibility of treatment options; if the treatment is not accessible you can not hold it against people with substance abuse disorder to not engaging in these treatment options.

However as a thought experiment; what if the US had well functioning and accessible treatment options *and some people still didn't access them*? What would be the societal strategy for those that do not want to get well? How many resources should be given to people that eschew well defined pathways? 

I don't believe that someone afflicted with substance abuse disorder loses all agency. If you believe they lose all agency, then you're advocating they lose legal capacity to make decisions about their care. So I think most agree that despite substance abuse disorder (in the absence of other co-morbidities) they still have capacity and in turn responsibility in their decision making. So again, *if* treatment it was accessible and people eschewed it what would be our ethical duty?"
medicine,"This is going to become progressively worse.  The trend is for physicians to be employees.  It’s part of the govt plan to pay a “system” for the healthcare of a population.  That system pays all of the employees that care for patients including physicians.  That puts administrators at best on par with physicians if that administrator chooses to “partner” with doctors.   At worst, you have admins as physician bosses.   Neither system can work as the physician is 99% of the time more intelligent and harder working than the administrator in charge of them.  The system will eventually break.  People with this level of education and work ethic can’t function in a bureaucracy.   They can’t be fooled into believing that meetings and modules actually matter.  "
medicine,"Sure, but you're thinking too small.  Two words:  Dr Oz.....

I kid, but more seriously look up Joseph Loscalzo (chairman of medicine at Harvard)

Joseph Loscalzo, M.D., PhD. to Join N30 Pharma Board and Chair Scientific Advisory Board
Joseph Loscalzo M.D. Ph.D. Board Member at Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Dr. Loscalzo is a Co-Founder of NitroMed, Inc, Co-Founder of DZZOM Delaware Corporation, etc, etc

https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=4948592&amp;privcapId=32192

Basically, he's a board member/consultant of a million different biotech companies.  Each membership pays a small salary (not to mention possible stock), and they all add up.

He's an extreme example, but pharma/biotech companies are not banging at the door of Dr Good Ole' Country Doc, MD in Topeka, Kansas for his thoughts on a new patent (fyi I'm no Ivy League Doc.  I'm working a clinical practice).

So the way it works for most academics is that you give yourself a reasonable time (maybe 5 years or so) to see if it works out and you can make a reasonable career for yourself.  Maybe your research on oral insulin becomes promising and you get bought up by Facebook for a bajillion dollars. Maybe you create the next multimedia educational platform and you sell to google for a half-bajillion dollars (A harvard nephrologist created uptodate by recruiting free work from his buddies, and then turned it around for about 300 million).

But if it doesn't work out then you move on.  Universities know this, and hence they pay you a pittance.

PS.  again it's not *quite* as bad as this as there is a ton of overlap, but just wanted to give you an idea"

medicine,"Pain management practice with regular UA and six providers is, but not sure if that’s overly large or not. "
medicine,"The target sodium level depends on the patient's presentation and serum sodium. 120-125 might be too high of a correction (someone asymptomatic with a sodium of 103). Or too low (someone actively seizing despite reaching 121mEq/L). 

Dr. Verbalis (an endocrinologist at Georgetown who spent decades of his life studying osmolarity and its effects on the brain, even in vitro) et al. published THE paper on management of hyponatremia. A lot of it is purely expert opinion.

&gt; https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002-9343(13)00605-0 

It's quite extensive but but the TL;DR is that treatment, target and correction changes depending quite a few factors:

- Is it acute or chronic hyponatremia (in other words, did it occur within 48 hours or did it occur after 48 hours)? If it's an acute hyponatremia, the brain hasn't undergone certain adaptive changes which leads to the loss of osmolytes. You can theoretically safely correct 8-12mEq/day or 18-24mEq/48hours.

 In chronic hyponatremia, the brain undergoes [certain adaptations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470176/figure/jcm-03-01163-f001/) that decreases the amount of osmolytes. Rapid correction of sodium in a chronically dehydrated patient would cause dehydration and demyelination. Target is lower in patients with chronic hyponatremia, you try and increase sodium around 4-8mEq/day.

- Is the patient having symptomatic or asymptomatic hyponatremia? If he has symptoms, what are the symptoms? 
 Asymptomatic get stratified as mild hyponatremia in which case tx is fluid restriction (if euvolemic or hypervolemic).

 Moderate hyponatremia is treated with IVF and lasix (if euvolemic).

 Severe hyponatremia (these are the patients actively seizing infront of you or in coma) is treated with 3% hypertonic saline until seizure aborts. 

- What's the patient's volume status? If they're hypovolemic, treat as you would any hypovolemic patient with an isotonic fluid solution.

- What's the etiology of the hyponatremia? You could always treat the underlying cause.

- Is the patient concurrently hypokalemic? Sometimes correction of potassium can correct the sodium. There's a case out there where a patient ends up with central pontine myelinolysis after purely oral K+ replacement.

I can see how that poses an issue when there's a limited number of training spots. An issue that is really really important to address. However I tend to disagree that the right reaction is discriminate against women as a whole. My next intuition is to discriminate against applicants who answer screening questions with lower levels of commitment to personal sacrifice for the NHS- although this doesn't seem tasteful either.  Certainly as society becomes more egalitarian this part-time gap will shrink, so methods like free child care access be important to focus on as well. 

I wonder if these part-time % gaps are found in the US as well."

medicine,"The AU$ 390K course was an MBBS until the introduction of the AQF (Australian Qualifications Framework). MBBS is the traditional qualification for a medical degree in many parts of the world, although MD is a better reflection of the qualification. It is equivalent to an MD and always has been. The name has nothing to do with the cost. 

There are no free degrees in the UK, Australia or Ireland, the government funded degrees are obviously much cheaper, but not free. 

From a years perspective, undergrad would be 4 years if you want hons, then 4 of med (plus an extra year of you do a PhD with it), then 1 year as an intern, another 2+ as a house officer. 5-6+ as a reg and maybe another couple as a fellow. If you are going to go all the way to fully qualified its a similarly long road. 

&gt; Also, we make some of the best physicians and have achieved some of the most amazing feet’s in medicine.

The US has made some amazing doctors, but so have many other countries. That's not something unique to the US. IMGs in the US perform better than their American trained counterparts. That's almost certainly due to the strict examinations needed to work in the US, but it does suggest that the quality of medical education is pretty similar internationally. 

&gt; Which is why so many foreign trained doctors want to come to America to practice. It’s just a better place to practice. 

Could that have something to do with the significantly higher salaries than elsewhere in the world? Why work in Cuba for a pittance when you can work in the US for much more?

&gt; I don’t believe that a doctor should spend all their twenties studying and the bulk of their 30s learning the ropes only to get paid a shit salary.

I don't disagree, but why denigrate non-American trained doctors? So you know how little a doctor in Malaysia gets paid? It's very little. Junior doctors in Australia get paid less than the average wage, as do junior doctors in the UK. But all have put in similar amounts of work to train as a US doctor. 

&gt; The real issue is administrators, insurance companies, etc are taking the lion share of the money a patient pays. 

I agree that the US in particular has big issues in that regard. I also don't think US doctors extort their patients. But that doesn't really relate to if a foreign trained doctor can comment on the US and its system. You've commented on what happens in other countries without knowing what actually does. What makes anyone else different?"

Coincidentally we had a tabletop exercise 2 months prior (which I didn't go to, but a handful of management had) based on a 'big bang' scenario, which was echoed in the actual incident pretty closely, which shows how well the planners research the imminent threats*

Overall though, things worked well mostly because we work well as a team day-to-day so most of the stuff came as second nature.

*Major Incidents (at least in the UK) are categorised into the type of threat, e.g. 'Big Bang' is a single localised catastrophic event such as a bomb or building collapse. Others include 'Rising Tide' (a gradually building incident such as an epidemic, or release of chemical agent), 'Headline News' (public panic caused by real or imagined threat), 'Roaming Threat' (such as a lone gunman on the loose), plus a number of others - see https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g1144.full"

Here are the largest portions of the piece that relate to the point of contention here.

&gt;It is even a reasonable one for individual doctors to conclude that further treating a patient in front of them is harmful and not ethical? But when court decided it had the right to decide that the child should die rather than live, it became an abomination.

and later

&gt;But instead of saying this and allowing the child to go to Italy for care if paid for by private means, the NHS committed a grievous sin — it argued that the court had the right to decide that it is better for the child to die than live, justifying it on the same legal grounds used to take children away from abusive parents. This is state overreach and medical arrogance of the worst kind. It is just a small step away from a government claiming that a downs syndrome or otherwise disabled child (or adult) has a life that is not worth living. Those determinations may be acceptable for families who love them to make — families who see their loved ones suffer may well decide that the best course of action is to let them go, but it should never be a decision that a government should make.

&amp;nbsp;


So then let's look at /u/Awildferretappears 's excellent point above:

&gt;The court upheld the principle that while parents have autonomy over their child's treatment, it is not absolute and if their wishes stand a significant chance of causing no benefit, or in this case, further harm, then this can be challenged. There is legal precedent for parents challenging courts re: health decisions, adn [sic] some have found in favour of the parents: it's not a one way street.

The larger point being that at no point, ever in this case, did a court decide it was better for a child to die than to live. Dr. Aribini's argument is a blatant lie - *calling it a mistake or mischaracterization would be incorrect - it is a lie*. There is no ambiguity or shades of gray here - just a deliberate lie to make an emotional argument. The court, *based on the testimony of medical experts* and acting in it's designated role as the finder of fact, found that the treatment offered in Italy would not be beneficial nor would it reverse the permanent brain damage resulting in minimal (if any) quality of life. They further found, *again based on the testimony of medical experts*, that the transport had significant and severe risks of worsening the child's condition. Based on this decision, they ruled that it was not the right of the parents to subject their child to a dangerous and risky circumstance **for no conceivable benefit**. This is consistent with the principle that children are not the pets or property of their parents, and have the right to be from from dangerous and unnecessary treatment that cannot benefit them.

The argument that what occurred was ""the state to decide that someone’s life is not worth living"" is utterly divorced from the facts of the case, and quite honestly deserves nothing but contempt."

It's the only suture we have that doesn't lose tensile strength over time, which is a huge part of why it's used in vascular surgery when suturing two synthetic materials together.

I can definitely see within the next 15 years the possibility that you answer a bunch of yes and no questions, a computer forms a differential (more accurately than a human), a human does some poking in the locations the computer specifies, feeds it back in, computer then makes a decision as to patient diagnosis and disposition.

The issue I *do* see is with rare disease recognition. Computers will definitely bring a lot of risk-benefit decisions to the forefront. Do you CT that person who has a 99.9% chance of it being the principle differential, but a 0.01% chance of a rare disease that will cause crippling pain later?

1) If there's a consult service than can be involved, I either formally or informally discuss this with their service. If they agree I ask if they/their attending can weigh in. But be prepared to have a good reason to consult this service other than trying to undermine your attending

2) Document all decisions you don't agree with with something like  - as per Dr. ___. This shit comes up on night float/cross covering all the time, where you call the attending and they tell you to do something you think is wrong. In one situation I was told to try to keep someone that was CMO alive for a certain period of time. You just document that you are following their instructions."

And yet... Nah. I don't love my IUD, the cramps are terrible, but I'm happier having a few miserable days a month versus fretting constantly. And if I got migraines often, I basically would not try OCP as a preventative because I'm just scared of them. It's silly, but there we are.

(I am aware that there is a possibility that factor V Leiden or something weirder might be involved, but my doctor says it's not worth testing for anything unless I personally get a clot, which is fine by me, because even if nothing is actually wrong I'd still worry)"

I used the national median hourly rate from BLS.gov and used that for a 40 hour work week x 52 weeks to keep everything standardized.

Edit: title should be RN* -_-"
medicine,"at my prior job, hospital owned but rural clinic we had several similar threatening patients.  We did not have security at the clinic so admin gave us all mace and a alarm button that summoned the police.  Once when the button was used it took the police 15 minutes to arrive.  The irate patient had luckily left by the time they arrived. 

We demanded that our employer provide security but they had no interest in paying for someone to work security (this was a corporation that only gave 2 weeks in paid maternity leave).  So I got official permission to carry a handgun at work.  

It mostly stayed in a locked safe at my desk but if certain patients were coming in (Like the one who just got out of jail for bringing a knife to his last clinic to kill someone over a pain med prescription), then I would conceal carry in the exam room.  

I once was called to the front to be ""at ready"" for another angry aggressive patient.  I doubt the patient knew that if he jumped over the desk like he was threatening he would have likely been shot.  

Didnt shoot anyone and left the job over the cluster'fun' of corporate medicine and I dont need to carry anymore.  "
medicine,"I totally agree

I don’t think I work harder than the docs, but we nurses do get the selfless angel martyr thing and the “we’re the ones who save you from your doctor” thing that I despise.

Docs, thanks for saving the patients from disease, from nurses, from themselves... thanks for working so hard ❤️"
medicine,"Your English is perfect. "
medicine,"Definitely possible but will depend on where you are working (county-wise, rural/large cities) and what type of practice (rural vs academic). You will have to be ready to work 80+/hr a week for your residency (5yrs) and fellowship (1-2yrs) in North America. 

When you get into practice, you can to some extend build your own practice but this will almost always included hospital call. That means usually either a full week of call if your hospital has an acute care surgery team or 1/x (with x being the number of other general surgeons at your hospital). 

This will never be a completely 8am to 6pm job. There will be late night of take backs or long cases. I am not one who buys into the adage that you should only do surgery if you can’t imaging doing anything else, and at 3am I would rather be asleep not in the OR, but I take immense satisfaction in my daily work and that keeps me going. If you like a lot of things in medicine and want a ‘normal’ work life balance, try something else. "
medicine,"Probably not. At least not through employee health. Our residency program gave us a list of outside therapists who see residents so I’d probably go to one of them and hope they had sliding scale fees. "
medicine,"Assuming ablations decrease the number of patients in primary care offices who have afib, the burden of managing amiodarone and dig and anticoagulation would lighten both for physicians and patients, considering the number of people who do not understand what they’re taking or why, and/or self adjust their medications. Just this last week I saw a guy who checks his INR “when he feels like it”, a lady who wont take anticoagulation because she takes “an herbal blood thinner, “ and I admitted a lady with afib w with rvr with HR 150s who had stopped both her antiarrhythmic and anticoagulation a few weeks ago because she thought they gave her diarrhea

Alright.

Two sided mammary ablation came in a few months ago. The right one was perfectly shaped, clear margins visible, and it had about 3-4 clear tumors in it.

Then the left one. It was 10 pieces of mammary tissue, with tumor spread across 5 of the fragments, each marked with their own set of stitches. It was pretty confusing, but the assistant made it work.

Lumpectomies came in regularly with pieces stitched on. Always the same surgeon, who was always called to notify him he shouldn't send these sorts of puzzles to pathology. He still does."
medicine,Who completes training and does not know this?
medicine,"I will bite, as a layperson.  I haven't been in the hospital much myself, but I had a child with cancer and my surviving child has needed some hospitalization for kidney issues.  Both kids did several weeks in the NICU. So my responses are from the perspective mostly of pediatrics.

To summarize my overall sense of a resident's role:  They are not the shot-caller at the end of the day but will put a lot of legwork into gathering and evaluating information, and my sense is they usually have known more nitty-gritty details about what is going on or what the plan is.  If I have questions, it's the residents I ask to speak with - they might not be able to answer certain things then and there, but they will advocate the issue and dig out what I need to know.  When I have needed to understand more about what is going on, residents have taken the time to really explain it in great detail.  When I have been scared, there has always been that one amazing resident I develop a good relationship with who can reassure me.  I guess I have always felt that at the end of the day the attending calls the shots but the resident is the one influencing and advocating for our care.

Story time:  My son is adopted and was born opiate exposed with NAS in another state, where we traveled to meet him on his second day of life.  He was in the NICU for 11 more days on step-down methadone treatment, while we worked hard on the non-pharma supportive care for infants with NAS.  There was one resident who often seemed lead on us at rounds, who was just incredible.  She stopped by often, discussed with me in a lot of detail, I was so scared about my son potentially having seizures, etc.  Soon before we were discharged, she came to me and said no promises but we were likely to be discharged within a few days, which was incredible because it was much faster than what they saw as average, and she kindly credited our caregiving.  Even if she was blowing smoke up my ass, it meant a lot - feeling like a good parent to an adopted baby in the NICU was important.  She said she was going away for a few days for a family wedding and we might be gone when she got back, so just in case .... she wanted to say goodbye.

Just last week I was trying to remember her name wishing I could see where she is in her career and maybe send her an email somewhere telling her I'd never forget her.

I have similar resident stories from our time in ped-onc, and nephrology.  The resident who sat and went through the DDX for MPSGN with me with painstaking detail, while we both went through the labs with a fine tooth comb.  I must have been trying her patience, though she never showed it - I had 6 months of labs more or less memorized.  She cheered as loud as I did when the kidney issues went away, even though we never had any explanation for why they started in the first place.

Residents have been AWESOME to us.  (I also have amazing stories about Attendings and Nurses, I have just been surrounded by great medical professionals for my kids)."

medicine,"I'm one of those MBAs in healthcare administration. However, I was fortunate enough to have a physician mentor while I was in school.

It is extremely concerning seeing the disconnect between hospital administrators or, even worse, health system leadership, and physicians. I was amazed when I would bring physician concerns to executives and it would be summarily ignored or, to your point, treated as the physician's problem.

I could go on and on about how disconnected hospital administrators are from the real work physicians do. My biggest concern is that we will continue to see MBAs enter healthcare who do not possess the capacity to put patients and physicians first."

Yes it's a substantial financial undertaking, but you have to think long-term. In my case, I loved what I did as a nurse, but it was never enough. I didn't go the NP route because I didn't want to be limited in what I could do for my patients. If you're happy as a PA, stay where you are. If you're not fully satisfied, at least look into it.

medicine,"&gt; Category 1 C-section

This just indicates the urgency. It's meant to indicate that it should be done now (ie as fast as possible, usually 15-30minutes from assessment), which at my centre meant that the patient should go directly from triage to OR without delay followed by rapid sequence spinal or Stat GA. 

In terms of the decapitation, I'm still very skeptical. No one mentions that anyone carried fetal parts out of the delivery suite before the caesarian. in particular the first article mentions

&gt;""It caused the fatal injuries, it is claimed, and two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman before handing her the infant after performing surgery.""

The phrasing here, combined with the apparent lack of an ethics citation from the royal college/the institution for deceiving a patient in the context of an otherwise sensationalist article makes me think the patient heard ""decapitation=head detached"" and then when the head was still present after being given to her assumed it had been avulsed and reattached, which would not be the wildest assumption I've heard a patient make.

&gt;*You said we have global peace. There are many metrics one can use to prove that's not true.*

Oh, come on. You can't seriously argue that a few small-scale conflicts around the world is *remotely comparable* to the rest of human history in good faith. No, the world does not have total global peace. That's not really a reachable state. People will always die in violence. But we're looking at a 98+% death toll reduction compared the 1900s. Modern conflicts might as well be a rounding error.



&gt;*Militarism on a massive scale is unfeasable because of the nuclear tonnage floating over everyone's heads.*

Which is paid through the defense budget. What, you think all of that is free? Also, all those nuclear bombs sure helped Russia in Chechnya. Oh wait, *tens of thousands died*. Military conflicts adapt to changing circumstances. Nobody can go to war in 2018 against a nuclear power. However, they *can* go to ""totally-not-war"" and annex Crimea. There's that other time during the Korean War when we suddenly woke up one day and *somehow* North Korea had an *air force*. 

Restricting your idea of war to armored formations crossing the Fulda Gap is about as silly and dated as only picturing Redcoats standing in a straight line and shooting in volleys.

&gt;*a dozen other contributing factors, including a generalized global anti-war sentiment, international trade, nuclear weapons, etc etc*

For the record, extremely powerful weapons, anti-war movements and global trade were prime arguments against more war. In 1913. I think it was Keynes who said that financial pressures disappear the instant political ones materialize.

&gt;given you're a medical student and not a PHD in international politics.

Do *you* have one? Didn't think so. If you did, you'd know that these are undergrad level topics lol.



&gt;*misleading in your original post to say ""the military is useful, look at how much we spend on education and healthcare!""*

It's hard not to read the OP as ""military spending is a waste"". Go back and reread it. I disagree that it's a waste. Military spending may be a waste**ful** inefficient process but it's more than worthwhile overall.  It's the idea that military spending is a problem at 3%. *World Hegemony* for virtual pennies and people are complaining!?! The safest planet in HUMAN HISTORY?!?!

&gt;*I've never understood how people make this jump.*

If you want to stoop down to the level of insults, that's fine. Not understanding the above says more about you than it does me. You can't study art and philosophy if you've been gangpressed into the kolkhoz. You might not understand it because the DoD does its damn job and you don't have to worry about war!

&gt;*how about the suggestion that we've stopped killing eachother because we have nice things?*

That's an extremely simplistic analysis. Steven Pinker wrote a book about it I believe. I can find it if you want. There are other hypothesises which I'm much more inclined to believe.


&gt;*I'm not. I'm implying that spitting back talking points designed to gain political capital doesn't make a person educated.*

I don't know about you guys but I've seen experienced doctors scream and get hysterical during operations more than once. In what one could considered an operation going well. Blood has an effect on us, you might deny it but it's the truth. 

The place I'm at right now we practice medicine without a lot of resources and it's messy. For example machete victims are not directly sent to the OR for whatever reason, if it's not life compromising, there's no surgeon around, etc. So one has to fix the problem. Then you have multiple patients with machete wounds, you can practically slide across the room with all the blood on the floor. (Done it a few times). I've seen veteran ER docs panic and nurses when they see the amount of blood, when they come to check and in most cases they run back out to regain compoaure... Looking at any type of green garment helps a deal at least to me. If only takes 2 seconds to do... While putting pressure on the wound or trying to ligate a bleeding wound...

medicine,What did he say?
medicine,"They still have to do bioequivalence studies and file for ANDA which costs a fee. It's nowhere compared to actually getting a new drug to market though. 

The main reason generics are so expensive recently is because brand manufacturers will contract out the rights to make the generic to a single company during the time the brand company is ligitating patent rights. This gives that company a headstart to complete applications/trials etc and gets their product to market first allowing them to charge almost brand prices. 

The generic company then might also payoff other generic manufacturers from entering the market to extend their period of no competition. 

So for a lot of drugs coming off patent, prices aren't going to be much lower for 2-3 years afterwards depending on how well the brand and generic company protects their products. "

I think that mesh has a role in the management of stress urinary incontinence as the second-line therapy after weight loss and pelvic floor PT.  That's a textbook answer, right there.

medicine,"There is evidence showing that hip fracture patients admitted to the orthopaedic service have a shorter length of stay and  slightly quicker time to OR.  Whether that's a good thing or not in the long term is anyone's guess, although I'd imagine it doesn't exactly portend for good outcomes considering other data I mentioned earlier.

The bottom line is, within the entirety of the scope of such a patient, an orthopedist is trained to fix his/her hip fracture.  Whether a hip fracture gets fixed by X or Y, it doesn't really have a strong impact on outcome.  What *does* have a strong impact on outcome is the active management of a patient who likely much more sick than perceived (which is the general consensus on the cause of the 20-30% one year mortality rate following a fracture whose treatment allows a patient to ambulate immediately)"

I've always thought physicians had an obligation to report patients with warrants (especially in cases of heinous crimes like murder/rape/etc), but it seems I will have to consult ethics regarding this. The one time a patient with a warrant did get arrested was when he punched a nurse and threatened to kill us all with the gun in his car.

medicine,"&gt;  memorable patient

PGY-3 : Cardiology elective, I was on 24 hour call. Setup: A 2 year old had come in for PO intolerance, vomiting and lethargy. The hand off from the ER to the PICU was sloppy, and the kid sat in the ER for an almost an hour without any labs, meds or fluids after the admit orders were put in. The day team had ordered admission labs but didn't follow up on anything. If they had analyzed the labs they would have seen that nearly every single organ system was going south. When I arrived at 6pm for sign out the kid coded on us, and even before sign out I was bagging and intubating the kid... I knew I was in for a hell of a night.  After stabilizing the kid, we put in a central line and a PICC and sent more labs. NA, K, CL, Cr, Glucose, CO2, CA, ABG, Coags, LDH, every lab was a fucking mess and even with interventions the labs results were getting worse. We were chasing our tail for labs that should have had interventions 6+ hours ago. Certain things like Calcium, K and NA  you don't want to correct too quickly, so we had to hope the kid would eventually make a turn and that our interventions were working. It was the patient's pathology vs our knowledge the entire night. After the kid coded for the second time I spoke with the attending (now at home) around midnight and he felt confident in my plan. The kid was started on max pressors, fluids, platelets, glucose drip, and several other things,  I was personally drawing ABGs and running them to the lab in order to have results as quick as possible. Eventually we had to sedate the kid since he started fighting the vent but mindful that we did not want to mask any possible seizure activity. At this time we had 7 other kids in the PICU that night that we were also taking care of.  By 6am we had stabilized/fixed nearly every problem (except for the Acute Kidney Injury), the entire team was exhausted, but I am proud to say, that night we kept that kid alive.  

Every day for the next week I came back to the PICU, would look in the crib and say to myself ""come on buddy you got this"".  Day by day IV lines were removed, sedation was reduced, and best of all the brain MRI was completely normal. Final dx: Septic shock secondary to enterococcus bacteremia

medicine,"A number of people had bolt cutters. Several people managed to get a piece of the fence as a souvenir. 

Do you know what the area around the fence in Gaza looks like? A teenager with a bolt cutter is not a direct threat to anybody. Could she have cut the fence? Yes. Does that justify shooting her with live bullets? I would definitely say no, and I believe the international community as well as almost any expert in human rights laws would agree.

Now, we are talking about medics and a physician, who were wearing distinctive clothing that had been registered with the IDF, and who when walking towards the fence held their hands up to show they were headed to help a wounded person. The physician who was shot describes standing around during a time without active shooting, a ways away from the general crowd (and the smoke), and being suddenly shot. The medics who were shot were in the process of attending to wounded people.

If you want to say you can’t tell who is who, the appropriate response is to NOT SHOOT LIVE FIRE. You can’t risk it. And, as I’ve said, what is the risk of not killing people? If there was some sort of large-scale breach of the fence, with armed violent people, that’s another story. But that didn’t happen, and if they felt it was necessary they could have just used tear gas and rubber bullets (and sparingly). 

They could have chosen not to shoot people with real bullets. That’s not the choice they made. [As I said above, I have a son born in Jerusalem and a husband fluent in Hebrew who reads the Israeli press, and is a history professor who regularly teaches classes on Israel. I’m very aware of the realities of the situation, and the fact that the Palestinians are not without culpability. I still think it’s clear that live fire was unnecessary, except in perhaps a few cases that might be justified, and that there is enough suspicion that they were targeting medics that it’s worth investigation.]"
medicine,"Sounds like a good catch, while I highly doubt none of the prior 3 docs and chiropractor did a history and physical on the patient, it's good that the patient got to an answer.

I think the realm of PT is different however.  The nature of complaints that lands someone in front of you is different from say vague abdominal pain, headaches, diarrhea, cramping, overall body pain, weakness, etc.  

For example, an MRI of the shoulder isn't an unusual diagnostic test.  I'm honestly surprised it wasn't ordered much earlier on unless it truly was an unusual presentation.  But what would you have done if the MRI was negative?  A lot of these patients have had extensive negative work ups and are using tons of resources as they doctor hop and have diagnostics repeated.  

What would you do for a patient with vague knee pain with negative x-ray, MRI, negative serum tests, and inconsistent physical exam findings?"

medicine,"&gt; There are many patients who don't have any years of productive life expected (either too old, or too young and sick), or any reasonable prospect of long term recovery who nonetheless have large amounts of money spent on them.

how would you categorize the life expectancy of an IV drug user with repeated valve infections who needs a third valve repair and obviously won't take their anticoagulation afterwards? how long do you think that person will live?

surgeons won't operate on someone who can't or won't take care of their valves afterwards, that's incredibly common and the risk of stroke is far too high to do that. i'm surprised they did this patient twice already. 

the only reasonable option is a prolonged course of antibiotics - if the patient receives that, doesn't relapse, comes to their outpatient appointments, and has persistent valvulopathy on echocardiography afterwards and the surgeon STILL refuses to perform the surgery, then you have an ethical dilemma. if any of those criteria are not satisfied, then there is no reason for the surgeon to operate.

you seem to be under the assumption that surgical management is the only option for endocarditis, but it is not. valve repair is not low risk and the surgeon is the one who weighs the risks and benefits, no one else. "
medicine,"Hahaha at least they talked to you. We had one resident who would just snap her fingers to get one of us to take whatever patient chart she was holding and see what was going on with them. No words, no eye contact, no actual addressing us as human beings. God that rotation was messed up."
medicine,Not a candidate unless he can lose the required 10-15 pounds on his own first
medicine,"As you've probably gathered, the objections are practical more than conceptual.

It is very clear that a head transplant could not result in a functioning connection between brain and grafted spinal cord. We're not even able to do well restoring connections to carefully severed spinal cords in an otherwise intact subject. If this worked, it would be revolutionary; if this worked, I think it would also produce some other even more exciting advances on the way.

So if the transplant doesn't restore neurological function, then the question becomes why one would do it. Let's assume, and it's a big assumption, that blood vessels, trachea, esophagus, and the rest could be connected. What is the point? We would be putting the head of someone with a terrible impairment onto a body and guaranteeing the same or worse impairment. In a quadriplegic patient it is not the body that fails, except secondarily to loss of signals from the brain. The transplant doesn't fix any of that.

There is no problem for which this offers a solution until the neural wiring problem is sorted out, and I think if that's sorted out then it will also obviate a lot of the cases \(traumatic spinal cord damage\) that might benefit."
medicine,BUT DID YOU DIE?!?
medicine,"1) My personal belief is no.  But i believe it is impossible to state with absolute certainty what the child's best interests are in this scenario.  To do so would require one to be absolutely certain that death is better than life.

2) No.

3) Yes, if the court is certain as to what the child's best interest is.

4) Yes. This is what we do every day to kids with Downs syndrome and kids with cerebral palsy, to say nothing of numerous other disorders.  They are made to undergo painful, life prolonging procedures to treat spasticity, heart defects, etc.  As to cases where the child is unaware the parents are there... there are some cases of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy where you wonder if they are or aren't."

1. Ways to point out important things. In paper charts I can circle something and it's obvious that was important to me last time. In EMRs everything gets lost in a sea of paragraphs of normals. Maybe something up top in a different color or something. Definitely not pop-ups before the rest of the chart loads, though; those are too annoying.     
2. Good drawing, although I don't think that's possible. I've never met an EMR system with a built-in drawing program that worked well enough to be better than me drawing on paper and scanning it in.     
3. Easy way to see changes over time. With paper, I could just flip through and see how certain pieces of data change year to year very easily. With EMRs, it's there's eay too much clicking and scrolling. Some data points have a nice progression section I can pop up, but not nearly enough data points have that."
medicine,"Have you considered talking to a lawyer about this?  
 
First of all, he assaulted you.  The legal definition of assault is “a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent present ability to cause the harm.”  Even if he never actually hurt you, he committed assault, and in no way did you “overreact” to it.  Fuck everyone who said or implies otherwise.

I don’t even know where to begin with all of these red flags from your employers.  Aside from at least talking to a lawyer about your options, I would also suggest you get out of that office and toxic environment as soon as possible.

This wasn’t some dude cussing you out for refusing to prescribe opiates.  It is not your job or responsibility to “deescalate” when someone has you cornered, with a threat of a gun, and is threatening sexual violence against you.  The fact that your employer provided no support after and has actually implied that it was somehow *your fault*, makes me want to pull my hair out.  I’ll say it again for emphasis: fuck anybody who blames you or tries to play captain hindsight and tells you how you could have handled it differently.  

Also, needing counseling with a therapist after an event like that is 100% reasonable and rational.  If you’re afraid about licensing or your job because you sought out a mental health professional after, then even more reason to have a lawyer already up to date on the situation."

The two examples you provided, education and healthcare, are not coincidental - these are the two most heavily regulated and subsidized industries in the country. Of course the cost rises when the government issues loans and blank checks. What else do we expect to happen?

Anyway, I don't know what the solution is, but I've seen a handful of comments attributing the problems of US healthcare to capitalism, when the system we have doesn't look like a free market to me. We at least need to start with the right diagnosis before we can propose a treatment. "

medicine,"I remember quite a bit. Maybe not exact med dosages or vent settings, but the concepts - for example, the dos and don'ts of managing DKA or CHF, the types of meds patients should be on when they have certain conditions, etc. 

Most of all, an internship is important for understanding how a hospital runs, from how consults work, to how to discuss a patient's care with their RN, to the roles of PT/OT/CM/SW, to the importance of discharge planning. My internship hospital catered to a very underserved population, so I learned to anticipate their needs and expectations and learned how to find resources to help them. It was a lot of stuff you can't learn in a textbook.

I guess this is why I'm skeptical when my colleagues insist that a year-long prelim year is too long. I learned a lot of skills in internship that still help me care for patients, things I could really only learn from a full year in the hospital. Intern year sucked, but I'm grateful for it."

medicine,"Hmm does that count as ""chart jousting""? I was told to never do that because it won't protect you and will only cause drama. Not sure if this situation is the same though. "
medicine,"Let me clarify - the BLS data saying doctors make 100/hour is about nominal hours since very few doctors get paid on a strict per hour basis (unlike nurses). Most of us are either on a salary which assumes a certain number of hours but in no way tracks how many hours we actually work or we're in private practice in which case you're nominally working 8-5 five days a week but in reality you're available 24/7. If you corrected for that, I doubt most doctors would earn more than 70 dollars or so an hour. "
medicine,"I realize it's being nit picky, but
the hospital acts like a third party that bills your insurance and really isn't a party to your contract with your insurance company (which is what determines what you actually pay). That's part of the problem.  The hospital is doing what you suggest they should by providing an estimated bill to the insurance company (or to you). The problem is, what the insurance actually *pays* the hospital is not the same price that there hospital bills (the insurance pays a ""negotiated rate"") and what you end up paying out of pocket is based off of those reimbursements, not the actual bill. It's insanely frustrating, I know, but the only person who can even begin to give an estimate of your out of pocket costs is your insurer. The hospital just doesn't have enough information to even ballpark it for you. Hospitals are messed up in a lot of ways, but this particular issue is on the insurer. "
medicine,"That's not completely untrue; it depends. If a tumor is caught very early, we do have a couple of surgical approaches that allow for the *possibility* of hearing preservation. However, the odds still aren't great. And because of the slow-growing nature, the majority of vestibular schwannomas are not caught that early."
medicine,"Thank you for asking a productive question. 

I think EMRs would make more sense if they more closely reflected common ways that practitioners philosophically interpret patient information and data. 

For example, right now, as a practitioner, when we present patients during rounds, we usually follow a uniform flow:

""Lets begin rounds on Ms. X. Comments or concerns from nursing staff today on patient X?"" 

nurse: ""No. Oh, yeah. One thing, Diet. When is X clear to have ice chips?"" 

Rounds: ""Should be maybe this afternoon, we'll get there during the round. please proceed, med student / resident / intern / PA / NP / student."" 

Student / practitioner: ""Mr X is a Age Year old Sex, past medical significant for R, Y, G, M, presenting to ER on Date with acute AAA, making X hospital day 5, Post op day 2 from repair of AAA.

 At present, patient X reports feeling V, Vitals are ___, Labs are ___, Rad is ___, drains are ___, Ins and outs are ___, and they're presently getting infusions of ___. 

Systems wise with plan regarding X,

Neuro/Pain/Psych
HEENT
Chest/Cards/Vascular
Pulm
Renal/Lytes
GI/Diet
GU/pelvis
(heme/onc if applicable)
Endo
Derm
Musculoskeletal
Psych

This concludes round on patient X"" 

While this litany gets recited, the attending are half listening / wanting to know if the patient is able to leave the unit / get discharged, barriers to that event happening, and if the patient is going to decompensate in a way that might be foreseeable. 

So, what I imagine, is one interface specific for attendings, with those three items foremost-- like a sort of prezi. Three primary bubbles, with spurs that are tangentially explored off of those primary bubbles.

What I imagine for practitioners / students, is four primary bubbles: Presenting problem/PMH, present objective findings, present system problems, and present system plans. 

What I imagine for everyone / nurses, is a timeline that is magnifyable, similar to the bar on a mac, where a hover can magnify/ explore detailed events in the patient's medical history, and a horizontal bar chart of medications initiated and held over time, and a horizontal bar chart of diagnoses accumulated over time, just above or below the timeline. 

It would look like this: [ ----------------- ]

medicine,"I think auscultation has a number of valid uses. I don't think we should get rid of it at all. But it isn't a screening test. Compare for example to one of the best screening tests we have, colonoscopy. If someone got a normal colonoscopy 6 months ago, you can be pretty convinced they don't have colon cancer. If someone had a normal cardiac exam yesterday, you have no real clue what's going on with their valves. When positive, it helps rule things in, but when negative it isn't particularly good at ruling anything out.

I realize you got your sensitivity and specificity numbers from uptodate but their source for that is from a very specific and apparently unfindable article about LVOT obstruction during acute MI published in 2001. If I could find the full text I'm guessing it would simply cite an even older article done in some specific and nonapplicable setting. Frankly I simply don't believe those numbers for the practice of medicine today. [This](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/38/suppl_1/ehx493.P5437/4086797) seems much more realistic with sensitivity in the 30-40 range and specificity maybe hitting mid-80s if you're an expert but honestly probably much lower.

The midwives I see won’t even consider an induction unless out of medical necessity before 41 weeks . The midwives also are way more supportive of “natural” birth. I was told by the same ob during both my pregnancies that “most women think they don’t want an epidural but they end up getting one and that more than 99% of patients get one “.

University professor with 9+ months of severe depression. Stopped going to work. Separated from his wife and kids. Bought a gun and put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger. It jammed. Minutes later, friend calls him out of the blue and gets him help.

Once admitted, he outlines a very logically illogical reason for his depression. He is an astrophysicist that has realized life has no meaning and the universe is cold and dark and empty. He says he is certain he will always feel this way and says it was a moment of weakness when he agreed to be admitted. His only reason for admitting himself is that he recognizes his suicide will traumatize his family. Says he knows what kind of things he would need to say to appear non-suicidal and thinks he might just say whatever he has to to be approved for discharge so he can complete the suicide. 

This type of person would clearly benefit from inpatient hospitalization (and probably ECT). "

medicine,"&gt; consent for surgery to a specific organ does not extend to doing completely non-essential things to the organ.

In every case I’ve seen it done, the surgeon is also doing the exam, so it’s clearly an indicated test for that surgery. You could say “the surgeon did it, so the student doesn’t need to”, but if we followed that standard then students would just be shadowing and never learn how to do stuff. Students are already doing much more invasive stuff in the OR as part of the surgery, so it feels strange that that’s where you draw the line."

medicine,"Sports medicine for EM, is it something chill and still well payed to fall back on? "
medicine,"Based on some experience of OHCA data here, this is likely a crew resource management issue and not a reflection of ETI versus SGA.

It is likely that completing ETI is increasing the time off chest compared to the SGA, as an SGA can be inserted significantly quicker and lends to a focus remaining on CPR and shocks.

I say this because in my area we showed that the introduction of the first paramedics caused ROSC to drop. It was then found that the paramedics were too focused on IV access and ETI and not enough CPR and shocking was being done. After corrective training the issue was resolved.

For general resus an SGA will always make more sense, but I worry that removing ETI from paramedics will harm the rare patient who absolutely needs a tube."
medicine,"First, I have many thoughts on how to write a better H&amp;P and progress note for both inpatient and outpatient care. That's about what providers should do; EMR can guide what and how we document, but it isn't our documentation, and I'm going to leave it out.

There are also rules about documenting and coding/reimbursement. It's important; that's what keeps us all in business. I don't care. Give me a version that is useful for taking care of patients, and the billing and coding can be sorted out afterwards.

**tl;dr**

Make it easy to see less, not more, so that attention can be focused on the important stuff.

Reduce and simplify.

Customization can be overwhelming, but it's probably better to give less and let users add more than overwhelm with buttons, tabs, and options.

Interfacing with other places, pharmacies, and people should come standard.

**Medications/Orders**

I want an easy and obvious medication administration record \(MAR\) and prescribed meds view. Let me see what changed, when, including when medications start or stop and when doses change. Don't make every one\-time dose a separate entry and make the entire thing unreadably huge. This could probably best be shown as a timeline with colors for different drugs, dots for when it's given \(inpatient\), and changes in thickness for dose changes. \(It doesn't have to be a perfect X pixels = Y dosage. Just let me see if it went up or down!\)

Along with that, especially for outpatients, have a clear and obvious way to see when prescriptions are going to run out and how many tablets/capsules a patient should have left. If this could be interfaced with pharmacies so I can see not only when I prescribed but when I picked up, and also what was prescribed by others—clearly, in a way that doesn't make me enter and then reconcile every single med—so much the better.

It should be possible to see what someone has prescribed a medication for. I know, we hate doing it. If a medication can be associated with a diagnosis once and then keep it, that's a reasonable thing to ask, I think.

It should also be immediately apparent when orders were put in and by whom. This is basic yet somehow not standard.

Custom order sets are very helpful, and shareable ones are better. It helps cut down on oversights and errors. Diabetes management is often the most painful because it involves frequent changes and multiple meds. Don't have alerts for redundancy \(yes, I do intend for both basal and short\-acting insulin on every single patient!\).

**Notes**

Put these in different categories, and let me look at each one. Physician notes like H&amp;P or daily progress note should be easily found without being buried in nursing notes. Case management is also important, but keep it out of the medical stuff \(and keep medical stuff out when I want to see progress on dispo!\). Let me look at my own notes only, and look at notes by team/service. If I want to see what psych has said and when, I should be able to; the same is true for all the dozen consulting services or doctors my patient is seeing.

I'm not certain about detailed templates. On the one hand, typing an exam every time I see a patient is a waste of time. On the other hand, an auto\-filled complete exam is false; no one's checking cranial nerves at every single encounter during a \(non\-neuro\) hospitalization. I would like it to be clearer what actually was assessed versus what's boilerplate.

All the garbage that ends up in notes should go. I don't need a full problem list of everything a patient has ever had; that means I'm going to lose acute problems in the pile of chronic or even resolved issues. I don't need an allergy list daily. The tried and true SOAP format works well, and the assessment and plan can be by system, by problem, or freeform but it's very helpful if there's at least a nudge to explain why all interventions are being done, and if they change to nudge for an explanation for the change.

Oh, and people are going to copy/paste notes. That's fine. Make it easy; I bow to the fact that this saves a huge amount of time on things that don't change.

Epic and psychiatry specific complaint: if you make me log in over and over to read my own notes on my own patients because of extra\-protected information, you're a monster.

**Vitals/Labs/Information**

Let me trend and compare things, but don't stick weeks of labs in every note. Ideally show what's ordered, what's drawn, and what's pending in the lab.

I don't know how best to handle alerts. They are useful, but there are so many and they are so sensitive but nonspecific that in practice we all just click through dozens of alerts without even noticing. The number needs to go way down, and maybe get color\-coded for ""maybe consider this"" vs ""*this is a terrible idea, what are you doing?*"" If an alert is cleared once, probably stop popping it up for every single note. Yes, I know there's a documented milk allergy and yet the patient is taking a lactose\-containing medication. It's fine. No pop\-ups.

**Communication**

Make it immediately obvious who the primary team is for inpatients.

It seems to be a trend to build in a kind of mini\-email communication system. Why not just integrate email? Similarly, for settings that have service phones or pagers that can take texts, let me text/text page directly from the EMR. Hell, have the EMR

**Interface**

It should be easy to have multiple windows/views open. If I want to have the last note, labs, and the note I'm writing open at the same time, please let me. Customization has pluses and minuses, but if you make it easy to personalize views and e.g. available tabs, it's helpful. Not everyone needs the same info, and sometimes what's critical for a service or person gets buried in too many layers of menus.

Let me save and temporarily put on hold anything I'm doing, whether charting or ordering. In fact, autosave in case of disaster."

Does the skeptic in you wonder whether your were just continuing conservative management and it just happens that the last treatment you had came from a chiropractor rather than a therapist or DO?  

If there was any truth that chiropractic manipulation of the neck had any benefit beyond that of placebo, it would have been found by now within the mountains of scientific evidence.  

The ""it happened to me so I'm a believer"" concept is the antithesis of science.  Some guy is diagnosed with cancer - he gives up on evidence based therapy and decides to undergo a juice cleanse in order to rid his body of toxins.  Turns out, the early rounds of chemo combined with the body's immune response and his cancer's relatively low tenacity resulted in remission of his disease.  Yet in his mind (and in his books and pamphlets and online store and traveling seminar series), the juice cleanse cured him.  He is a living, breathing example of the power of juice to fight cancer!  

There is always an explanarion for why things happen, even if it isnt evident to us on a case by case basis.  The gift of science is the process by which we can definitively conclude whether things are truly related to each other or just an act of happenstance.

Bloods showed raised WCC, N’phil and CRP. Various teams consulted; Cardiology - TTE normal, proceeds to TOE, also normal. Rheumatology - infective cause, not rheumatological as normal blood tests. Orthopaedics - may be a septic left knee but normal tap and was on antibiotics. 
Improved on IVAbx; normalised inflammatory markers and no fevers, discharged on orals.

Returns 3 days later with the same symptoms as prior. Restarted on IVABx for failed treatment of ?septic joint. Improves after a week and is discharged again. 

Returns again 2 days later with the same symptoms. Investigations +++. Normal CTCAP ?abscess. Normal MRI knee ?osteomyelitis. All blood cultures normals. Knee aspirate normal, wrist aspirate normal. Hepatitis, EBV and HIV immunology normal. Lymes serology normal. Unrated normal. Autoimmune and rheumatoid panel normal. 

Treated as presumed septic knee with normal samples due to being on Abx prior. For 6 weeks IVAbx via PICC. Discharged on IVAbx.

Readmitted AGAIN with the same symptoms. Further Rheum input - has high serum amyloid, high ferritin and high light chains and light:heavy ratio.

medicine,"""You don't lose volume out of a chest tube""

Said by the attending trauma surgeon to a group of interns, in regards to the patient in front of them with a clearly perforated lung. 

They were trying to diagnose why this patients VT exhaled was so much smaller than their VT inhaled. Were talking 450 VTi to 30 VTe here. 

We ended up bronching her, because,  ""maybe she has a tracheal fistula or something below the cuff?""

I, being a brand new RT for all of 5 minutes,  had no idea wtf was going on. Only that a bunch of my coworkers were standing outside the door, laughing at me. 

I later found out that Pulmonary was about 20 feet away at the nurses station, but no call for aid was put out because ""Trauma and Pulmonary don't talk to each other.""

And thus was my introduction to medicine.

There's a video of her being aided into her van after the 9/11 memorial.  She doesn't appear to be moving under her own power.  Laypeople (myself included) suspect that may be a serious issue.  How serious is it really?  Or rather, does a symptom like that frequently result in a diagnosis of something minor?

medicine,"I disagree. The NHS team wanted to stop invasive procedures because, in their medical judgement, the risk of harm substantially outweighed the benefits for the child.

The transfer was not a neutral option There was a significant chance of a it causing harm and suffering. Both the Italian and British teams agreed.

The fundamental difference between the Italian team and the British team was simple: should life be extended in any way possible, regardless of suffering?

The Italian team proposed a trach, inserting a PEG, and an air transfer, all so that full life support could be continued as long as possible. 

The British team, who had the advantage of a year of care for the child, felt that this could inflict unnecessary suffering, and that the child should be allowed to die with dignity.

The court agreed with the British team.

medicine,"That can be frustrating. One of our hematologists talks about the drug-seeking mentality that we’re all rightly so cautious of.   She points out the obvious: there’s no question that sickle cell patients are much more often opiate addicts than others- we made them that way.  We had no choice but to make them that way. Our compassion demanded we make them that way.  She also talks about the average pain threshold for a sickle patient- it’s much higher than most.  They largely lose their reaction to what many would call severe pain.  So the question is, is the patient you describe malingering, or is he so inured to decades of pain that he knows how to get ahead of it?  He knows when his pain will worsen without meds, and he knows what to say to get what he needs.  Honesty’s gotten him burned in the past.  Did he list those meds as allergies because he’s lost precious time in the past, and ended up with pain beyond his already immense psychic boundaries’ ability to handle? And if he is just there to malinger,  can we blame him when we’ve been doping him with morphine and dilaudid since elementary school?

I do t disagree with you, and I know that frustration.  But I feel like sickle cell patients deserve a partial exemption from our suspicion that a person is drug seeking- of course they’re drug seeking.  We trained them."

Read a little on it. From this definition of claims-based: 

""Claims made policies provide coverage so long as the insured continues to pay premiums for the initial policy and any subsequent renewals. [..] Once premiums stop the coverage stops. Claims made to the insurance company after the coverage period ends will not be covered, even if the alleged incident occurred while the policy was in force."", why would anyone opt for claims-based, assuming they have a choice? 

Almost defeats the purpose of tail-coverage."

medicine,"Inner city barriers to care as far as addiction treatment? Great question. One certainly would be a bed being available for the state funded rehab facilities, as some patients have to wait a while. But hey, there is still an option. I do wonder if having more dispersed methadone clinics would help as we had many patients come to ED asking us to dispense because they “missed” their appointment. As far as continuity of care post state funded facility I’m not sure what the barriers are there because I didn’t work in that lane. 

I do very much agree with incentivizing rural medicine and pricing more resources there, but isn’t that already the case in some sense?  I do know for physicians (and mid levels? Not sure) rural compensation is better. Who do you think should be offered better compensation in rural care? I’m not trying to disprove you or be argumentative, I sincerely want to know what you think. "
medicine,is SCAD not a STEMI?

Instead, it was made on the grounds that it is better that the child to die rather than live, and that the courts have the right to make the decision.  The latter is what the piece is objecting to... its an interesting position, and one I support.  In short, everything except the denial of transfer of care was okay."

medicine,"Read the protocol; you don’t take ketamine daily for depression. 

When weighing the risk, you have to consider the harm to the user and the harm to society. Both is very low with ketamine. The issue with ketamine is binging, not classical addiction. Ketamine is very safe and it won’t kill anybody who takes it, unlike other drugs rx’ed daily. It may look off putting to a pt’s family member if the pt decides to take more than they should and K holes, but in an hour or two, they are back to normal. During that hour, they will be unresponsive and appear to be asleep. But they are fine. 

The risk to the user and society is much lower compared other drugs rx’ed much more frequently. And the benefits of successfully treating treatment resistant depression in the acutely depressed pt clearly outweighs any small risk. "

medicine,"&gt;A head transplant would be an advanced and superior form of a life support system

The vast majority of people on life support are on it because they are neurologically impaired. There are very few cases where a disease that incapacitates the body but spares the head and brain.

The horse tranquilizer moniker really annoys me.  Most meds used in humans is used in veterinary medicine, for obvious reasons. Ketamine is obviously very dose dependent and one of its indications is to provide sedation, another is to induce unconsciousness. Those doses aren’t used for depression (and pain) infusions.

medicine,"This is actually a MUCH more complicated question than it seems on first look and it all hinges on what does the word ""supervise"" mean specifically. For example your question could mean

Can an experienced whatever watch someone less experienced and give good advice? Absolutely, our NPs teach our junior residents how to do trauma tertiary surveys, SBIRTs, write decent notes, etc. Nurses regularly coach interns on how to put in IVs, foley catheters, etc.

For the purposes of billing? I.e. can an NP bill for a procedure done by a resident like they did it themselves (for example, can the PICC nurse teach a resident how to put in a PICC line, sign the note and bill it). I don't know but this rule would be a CMS decision.

Can an NP supervise residents for the purposes of the ACGME? Obviously an NP cannot run a residency and you have to have ""adequate supervision"" for procedures but I bet there is no specific ACGME policy that says NPs can't be delegated to watch a resident do a procedure that they are certified in. If it became a pattern of lack of attending supervision I bet the ACGME would be alarmed however. 

I have a question though, are you just upset because a ""nurse"" is in charge of a minor procedure or do you really feel that this is damaging your education somehow?"
medicine,"I didn't go to that conference.

A five day infusion every four weeks is not good, no. But a five day infusion followed by a monthly several hour infusion? Or sublingual/intranasal/oral doses on some schedule? Or some other less intensive maintenance?

I think the problem is that medicine just got too large for doctors to want to run it, but now we pay the price for turning it over to the management and business experts.

Mid 20s man with no past medical history presents complaining of R lumbar and hip pain x 18 hours, reports that he stepped in a hole last night while taking out the garbage then woke up with pain and difficult ambulating. Hip flexion and extension are decreased on the R. No other symptoms to suggest cause equina. XR of hip is negative. Pain is controlled with narcotics and ketoralac. MRI of l spine shows no abnormalities. 

On reassessment, pt reports pain returning as narcotics wear off. He now notices that his shoulder is hurting, noted with decreased ROM but appears to be giving good effort. No numbness or parasthesia. Noted to be febrile to 101. Blood cultures obtained, treated with antipyretics, MRI of C and T spine ordered to evaluate for epidural abscess. Pt is stuck in queue behind scheduled MRIs for multiple hours, but they also are negative. Pt is unable to walk on reassessment. LP obtained and unremarkable.

Consult NSGY: “that’s weird but it doesn’t make sense.”
Consult neurology: “sounds like a surgical issue “
Consult medicine for admission for pain control: “Why don’t we CT abdomen/pelvis to eval for psoas abscess?”

CT shows no psoas abscess, but shows enlarged, fluid filled appendix, possible appendicitis. Pt admitted to surgery. Me as ED resident: “whoa, that’s an odd presentation, must have been a retroperitoneal appendix.”

Surgery resident later in the evening, “dude, that appendix looked pretty normal!” Path report: normal appendix. Blood cultures obtained in ED are now positive for Salmonella. On questioning on the floor: “Yeah, I had some diarrhea a few days ago, I thought it was some bad chicken and didn’t think anything of it.” He was discharged home on levofloxacin after recovering from his appendectomy.

Most of the attorneys at those firms are just employees so they get overworked to death. Working for some attorneys is nightmarish because our profession seems to attract pricks. 

I'm not sure how accurate this is but it seems like MDs used to run their own practices historically. Now it's harder and harder to find one that does for some reason. My favorite physicians from a patient perspective have always been the small doctor owned practices. I actually could develop a real patient-physician relationship rather than getting 10 minutes while the physician is spending half that time plugging information into some patient management software. I feel for the MDs that are forced into that sort of situation. 

If I were a psychiatrist, I wouldn't even hesitate to open shop. There's no way I'd be able to deal with the crap you guys put up with. It's a little scary starting a business at first but you folks are in a much better position to do it than a JD because there's so many attorneys. From a business perspective, I'd much rather be an MD than a JD.

Partners had mentioned that I leave behind A/R from employee to partnership, but I understood this to mean A/R from 2017 would be handled per the contract. As of 2018 I am to be paid as a partner with my A/R starting over from $0.

For smaller practices, you may be able to get away  with skipping the initial bill step but if practices are caught with significant upfront cash discounts, they can get in serious trouble with the companies they have insurance contracts with. I'm not trying to be a jerk, but compliance with this kind of stuff is what I do for a living, and I know what I'm talking about. Unless you run your own practice, you almost certainly don't get into the weeds on this issue as a physician. I consult for hospitals and practice management issues. Hospitals typically use a chargemaster to determine and initial bill which *everyone* gets, and then there willing to issue an adjusted bill based on your pay status. Which is exactly what you experienced. 

Edit: You seem to be confusing what a hospital will *actually* charge/accept as reimbursement with the initial billing procedure (which is what I'm talking about). Those are two very different things. "

medicine,"First disclaimer. I am not a MD. Just a radiographer. I was actually describing my case. I'm the mother with the terrible immune system that tries to also kill babies.

  


The first consultant who treated my first born described NAITs to me as the blood crossing the placenta at parturition which is supposed to happen. The maternal antibodies that cross over are there to protect the baby in its first few months of life but (in the case of NAITs) end up attacking it instead. So yes, exposure at birth.

  


Yes. The diagnosis was pretty neat. Explained a lot of things about me. Like lots of nosebleeds. Easy bruising. Slow coagulation after cut. Haemorrhaging at birth of my kids.

  


The consultant in Taiwan was very adamant from the get go that it couldn't be NAITs. He ordered the blood tests and made the comment about my low platelet counts. This triggered my memory where on separate occasions I'd had blood tests that showed the same thing. The first prepregnancy blood test was to make sure all my immunisations were up to date and the low platelet finding was mentioned but because I had just got over whooping cough we figured it was due to that. The second midpregnancy blood test (taken near the end of my firstborns term) also showed low platelets but this was explained as sometimes happening with pregnant women. I will note my platelets often hang about in the 100s so while I do have ITP it is a very mild form (which is also why it went undetected for so long)."

medicine,"Lynch Syndrome (formerly known as Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer) is generally associated with an extremely high risk of colorectal , endometrial, and more recently breast cancer. The most common mutations can have lifetime EC risks as high as 70%, prompting prophylactic hysterectomies. However, I recently learned that the PMS2 mutation, which is responsible for about 5% of all Lynch Syndrome diagnoses, is associated with lifetime risks of EC closer to 20%. What do you think would be the minimum lifetime risk at which you would recommend prophylactic surgery, such as a hysterectomy, to a patient? Would 20% be sufficient given the risks and costs associated with surgery verses the risks and costs associated with regular screening? If not, what do you think the minimum percentage should be?"
medicine,"I probably should have been more clear. The albumin we use for CHF is typically done in VAD patients who we think may be a little dry. Of course the hemodynamics are extremely tricky and a lot depends on the RV. We generally give cautious albumin since it’s difficult to predict exactly how much fluid these patients will need. You wouldn’t want to bolus a liter of NS, for example. Obviously the last thing we want in these VAD patients is to over-bolus them and precipitate cardiogenic shock and basically start the cycle all over again.

In run of the mill CHF I’d 100% use crystalloids. 

Regarding the NS LR debate - I’m not thoroughly convinced yet. There is a theory that supra-physiologic concentrations of chloride causes afferent vasoconstriction and leads to AKI - sounds plausible (it’s actually been demonstrated in rats). If that’s the case, then the fluid I normally use is probably even better than LR — 1/2NS+75meq NaHCO3. Isotonic, less chloride, no potassium (some patients may have hyperkalemia already from an acidosis-mediated shift). In either case, I don’t think there is one fluid that is superior to any other. Just pick the one that’s right for the patient in front of you. "

Great article though."
medicine,"wow I'm an idiot. here's the article I meant to post 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445694/"
medicine,"TLDR: patient presents footling breech with vaginal parts, what sounds like terminal decels, and a prolapsed cord. vaginal delivery was this fetus' best chance in an awful situation and forced traction was likely the best option once the head was entrapped
 
A tragedy overall but this physician does not deserve to lose her license for it. 

Longer version: 
I suppose there are a few potential things going on in this thing:
1. We have no idea what the actual set of events that led to this and patient details are notoriously unreliable. beware making judgements from media reports.

2. (edit: have been directed to another article that mentioned that there was full detachment of the head and that other OB's then went back in and retrieved it and stitched it back on(!!?!). This sounds weird (when something awful happens my site always wrapped in a way that made it least distressing. modifying the fetus could potentially be against institutional regs (certainly would be in Canada) or potentially illegal. I'm unwilling to rule out that the patient heard decapitated and misunderstood the medical meaning of the term.)  Decapitation as a medical term does not mean that the head comes clean off (necessarily). You can simply have dislocation of the ligamentous connections which shear the spinal cord and vessels. Fun fact: it is not always fatal!

3. Decapitation of preemies is something that is noted in the literature but is uncommon. It doesn't take much to dislocate and shear the neurovascular structures at this stage of development. See this case report: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265254853_A_Foreign_Body_in_the_Cervix_after_Spontaneous_Abortion_A_Rare_Case_of_a_Traumatic_Fetal_Decapitation

4. Even with the description provided you can tell the reporter doesn't  know what they're talking about. 25wk babies don't require full dilation. I've been at deliveries where the patient was at 4cm and delivered spontaneously. If this was a 450g baby a multip could probably cough the fetus out. 

5. Breech deliveries are once again back in favour for those practitioners familiar with them. Being premature can be a relative contraindication and pose a particular challenge because of the relative size of the cephalic portion of the fetus to the bitrochanteric distance (ie hips/butt). 

6. This patient's baby had a severe (heart rate) deceleration and preemies don't have much reserve. If the patient presented at 3cm and engaged and they were in active labour with a shitty FHR they already have a poor prognosis. Adding a stat GA may cause real harm to mom in addition to losing the fetus. I have met few staff who were excited to do regular GA's on 26 weekers at the best of times, nevermind a stat. 

7. Pain is secondary to safe delivery of the fetus. it sucks but its true. no one should have to go through this type of thing but part of being pregnant is choosing to have some pain at some point in the pregnancy. you are not obligated to become pregnant.

A tragedy all around, but taking this physician's license away would only make it worse.

medicine,"Just so you know I agree with most of what you said. Reddit and the field of medicine is growingly overtaken by this exact illiberal mindset of people who will label anything they don't agree with as bigotry, regardless of whether or not it has the characteristics of it.

Perhaps even more evidenced by the fact that this person really believes equality of outcome is a good idea. Why the flying fuck did I get into medical school then? Stratification of ability is exactly what you're talking about when you mention the second wave of feminism that led to women being seen as treated based on their ability not their gender. All of a sudden the consultants of medicine had to actually stand up to some scrutiny. Once we remove that then we're left with a bunch of watered down sharing circles too afraid to tell a patient that they should lose some weight, or a 70 year old cardiologist that they should take a look at the new guidelines."

That's not the most interesting part of the program (and to me it doesn't seem essential), but I do think their argument that it improves accessibility is very interesting.

Your regular bog standard lowlander can acclimatise by spending time at altitude, but most of these changes will be completely reversible on returning to sea level. 

A Sherpa born and raised at sea level *would* notice the difference if you suddenly took him to altitude as although he might have the same mutations, there is likely to be markedly differential gene expression and his homeostatic physiology would take some time to reset, so I think it might be fair to say he's acclimatised to a low altitude environment.

I'm not sure how much of a difference wearing scrubs would make, considering everyone brings their own (usually only students use those provided by the hospital) and goes to the hospital cafeteria etc. wearing them.

2. Maximize time with his parents and loved ones. This is provided that he is even aware of what's going on, of which there is probably a &lt;.01% chance. This goal honestly is more for his parents.
3. Maximize lifespan. This goal is tertiary to the first two goals. While it may help with goal 2, it may also interfere with goal 1, hence this case's dilemma. 


PLEASE ANSWER THESE THREE QUESTIONS FOR ME:


1. Is transferring this child to Italy for a trach/PEG in this CHILD'S BEST INTEREST? For added effect, pretend he had no parents.
2. Does parental interest take precedence over child interest?
3. Should the court be allowed to stop parental interest if it against the child's best interest?


After you've answered those question, answer this last one:

Should a parent be allowed to cause a child more suffering in exchange for extra time with them? Especially if the child is unaware that their parents are even there?

Many times, when the patient is discharged from the hospital, they’re continued on routine scheduled meds that were hospital protocol (like pantoprazole) by their PCP. The more the patient is admitted and discharged from healthcare facilities, the greater the chance of continuing unnecessary meds (or discontinuing necessary meds).

I agree that the North East, especially, tends to be more formal in all specialties compared to the West.

My clinic's outpatient docs wear a mixture of business casual \(button down shirt with slacks, sleeves rolled up \) to polo shirt with chinos. Only one person wears a white coat. Our residents generally go with business casual also, but sometimes scrubs they have pinched from a hospital.  They tend to dress more casual than the attendings.

Inpatient docs are usually wearing dress shirt with tie, \+/\-with a white coat. I never see them in scrubs. The residents are almost always wearing scrubs and a white coat. ED docs are all in scrubs.

Ultimately, the overdiagnosis aspect almost always comes back to possible emotional impact. Otherwise, that just leaves the argument that patients are getting surgery, radiation, hormonal treatment, and/or chemotherapy when it's not clinically appropriate.  Which doesn't seem like a screening issue.  

It will be interesting to see what sort of impact genomic testing and its impact on decisions about chemo and radiation will have on population screening efficacy.

My understanding of this is that med schools limit the enrollment of students in order to limit the supply of doctors in order to create a shortage that leads to higher wages and higher income for doctors.

Same holds true for pharmicists, physical therapists, and many other health care fields.  Nursing school, not so much, and look at how wages for RN's and LPN's are coming down.

Even interns with only provisional licenses have been successfully sued. 

It varies state-to-state, but there are states where you have to report any suit in which you were named when you apply for licensure, and a resident engaging in something that results in them being named in a suit, even with their attending also named, can absolutely delay licensure and employment upon graduation.

2) If a resident is sued for malpractice, the attending physician is often sued as well because he or she has the ultimate responsibility in supervising the resident.

3) If you are concerned about any license issues, then simply wait until you are done with residency to apply for your medical license."

Therefore, the tact Medicare takes already is by using surreptitious rationing by making it difficult to get things done and then taking money away on the back end by creating a payment system that is so byzantine that you cannot follow all the rules.  Whenever they want they can audit you and take back a bunch of money. That’s why the Recovery audit committees make three dollars back for every dollar they spend in auditing.

Because the charts are now more accessible and more immediately auditable, the expectation is instead that we should chart differently \(and often worse\) and bury ourselves in the machines that were supposed to help us.

How many doctors would prefer to replace their EHR with a simple blank text document, maybe with auto\-populated vital signs? How many doctors would prefer that note? I'd take it to cut down on the sometimes false cruft in so much documentation, as the article points out. All the bells and whistles in the chart are billable, but they're not actually healthcare."

&gt; allowing the united states government to take over the business of healthcare will reduce bureaucratic box taking

Why would this not be the case? You can't cite Medicare and extrapolate it, because Medicare is not a socialised healthcare system where the government is the provider. The experience with countries with socialised healthcare is that, indeed, bureaucracy isn't the issue that it is in the US.

&gt; The United States cannot afford everything for everybody healthcare, no one can. 

Would you mind exponding on your reasoning here? Universal Healthcare systems in general have proven time and time again to greatly reduce the expenditure in healthcare of a country, an expenditure that, as you kindly keep reminding me, is in a large proportion already being for by the Federal budget. 

&gt; the United States political system is not set up to be able to say that without the side that admits it suffering catastrophic defeats at the ballot box.

If residents received the same protection as these other citizens do then the wages would be expected to be comparable or indeed higher, based on their higher profit generating potential.

If residents competed for salary like other fields are allowed to then these abusive conditions could not exist.  The existence of these programs prove the illegal collusion to suppress wages.

An ideal plan would be doing well in college, ideally having some relevant experiences \(research, shadowing, or the like\), applying and getting into med school, doing very well in med school \(derm is one of the most competitive specialties\), and getting into residency. It's way too early to get your heart set on one field, though; you don't even know what most of medicine is like.

Student debt happens because of college and especially medical school. You only specialize after medical school, when you go into residency, and by then you already have your debt.

I might not have as many posters or publications as some of my peers, but that was the trade off I had to make to stay sane.

I don’t have any idea how non-medical fields are, really, aside from my husband’s field (history professor), but it feels like another very difficult aspect of medical training is the extent to which everything depends on exams and similar assessments. I had a bad day when I took Step 1 and scored 20 points lower than my average practice test. One bad day and it totally changed the trajectory of my career. Right now I’m driving myself completely insane studying for a board exam. We are constantly evaluated and scored, through college and then med school and then residency. I know that non-medical professions face some degree of this, so I’m not sure if my gut feeling that it’s worse in medicine is accurate. But between doing meaningless projects just to get a poster for my CV, studying for boards, trying to impress attendings to get good evaluations . . . I told a friend last night that I’m just ready to be in a position where I don’t have to constantly prove something to somebody.

We actually went to the leading Heamotologist in Taiwan who confirmed the ITP. Said because mine was mild, it wasn't anything to worry about. So we simply had lots of US to check for fetal intracranial hemorrhage and made sure the paediatricion knew to check platelet counts at birth.

I did take a very low dose of steroid throughout pregnancy to see if bringing up my platelet count (managed to get it to 160uL) would help the baby but while the second was born with a higher platelet count than the first, his platelets dropped faster.

The position I find compelling is ethical.  If someone were to submit a drug trial to an IRB with an underpowered research design, they should reject it (they don't always, of course, but they should).  For instance, if the study uses unnecessarily many participants to compensate for poor statistical practice, the IRB should nix the proposal.  We can't ask patients to take a risk just so we can avoid hiring a biostatistician.

However drug trials sponsored by industry are rationally discounted in their outcomes.  When an industry-sponsored trial comes up supporting the industry's desired outcome, anyone reading it would be well-advised to consider the source, not just the methods, in evaluating the research.  The fact is that industry sponsorship biases research toward supporting industry substantially (Greenbaugh's excellent book ""How to Read a Paper"" goes into this, and I believe gives the figure of 4x more likely to support industry, but I don't have the book in front of me).

So industry research has to be more impressive--enroll more patients and have clearer outcomes--to make an impact.  The source of funding alone makes it inadequate.  And underpowered studies are, in my view, unethical."
medicine,Thank you
medicine,"The other downside of DOACs is that a missed dose significantly affects your anticoagulation status, whereas a missed dose of warfarin doesn’t affect it as much. Though to be fair, a lot of patients then double up on doses if they miss, which is a point against warfarin. "
medicine,"Why do I need a lesson when I specifically detailed what you did correctly? Im not a nurse, Im a resident. Im fortunate that my attending salary will be more than what you have saved for retirement

I do commend you for smart saving habits as most of the nurses I know have lived beyond their means. My current girlfriend is a nurse and she is living responsibly, although she is not investing.

I already have a vanguard :)"
medicine,I'm glad to here some of us can make a difference!
medicine,"I found only one example of a scribe getting sued, but it was a failed PA (hadn't passed boards) working as a scribe who did his own history and physical on a stroke patient and the doc discharged them without a second exam.  I think if you don't do that you're probably good from a liability standpoint."
medicine,"Your comment is an example of why I love this sub. There is so much misinformation on the web on so many levels, even for those of us who spent 8 years in school and 3-7 of residency. Thanks for breaking this down!

Edit: the biggest thing I remember from med school nephrology rotation was that ""sodium levels on the CMP aren't telling you how much sodium there is, they're telling you how much water there is."" Not sure how truly accurate that is but it seems to agree with your first point.

Also, ""may hold some water?"" *Insert dad joke memes*"
medicine,"One of my ICU attendings was passing out a paper on using the pCO2gap as a end point for resuscitation. It seemed pretty logical, I'm sure there are some shortcomings that I haven't heard/read about."
medicine,"Oh believe me, we know no one reads it, except in three instances:  during audits in preparation for facility, state, or federal surveys; those aforementioned surveys; and the rare instance where a nurse is called in to testify in a case or defend themselves in court."
medicine,"Just hold some pressure over it, it will stop bleeding. Alternatively just throw a suture over it."
medicine,"I've had several patients asking for this recently, usually they also throw in other diagnoses like uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes. I fill out the form and giving them maybe a day or two off a month, and schedule them to see me frequently so we can get these things under control. But I refuse to give indefinite or continuous time off for otherwise routine medical problems. In all of the patients that recently asked for this there was usually underlying chronic pain, or socioeconomic difficulties. Sometimes you just have to politely say no while still trying to identify and treat the underlying problem. Not that chronic pain and socioeconomic distress are easily treatable..."
medicine,"I thought the only thing more dangerous than an intern with an article is an administrator with an article but you made me realize that a regulator with an anecdote tops even that. "
medicine,"&gt; They're not trying to help you, they're trying to look like they are. HR

It's really easy to hate on HR, but the truth is that HR departments are overwhelmingly unequipped to deal with the New Normal in mental health. The result? Seminars, lunch and learns, and powerpoints, because that's all they a) know how to do, and b) have budget for.

My spouse is an organizational psychologist. Redressing the kind of challenges physicians face is a Herculean task in itself, made impossible without forward thinking, considerable budgets, and risk-taking. Surprise, none of these 3 are typically part of mass-market modern medicine. You need mental health professionals on staff. You need to actually believe in the studies performed and the workplace norms suggested. You need to believe that 1 dollar invested in mental health will actually save you 4 to 7 dollars in prevented costs down the road. You need hospitals to not pay 100x inflated prices for basic medical supplies just because they have an exclusive deal with a supplier.

Then, just maybe, your staff will have a shot of making it without breaking too much inside."
medicine,"Savage, yet practical"
medicine,Sharpie. But make sure to initial and date it too.
medicine,Asking the important questions.  Clinical trial needed STAT.
medicine,"Can anyone tell me what are these? 
How to treat them? "
medicine,"I mean, considering they have literally dropped white phosphorus on a UN run school being used as a refugee camp, that wouldn't surprise me."
medicine,"I see data like this repeated quite often, but isn't it subject to selection bias? In places where ACLS rigs are available, they're more likely to be deployed to the complicated traumas and other accidents, some of which never had a chance of surviving regardless of what EMS response is dispatched.

This study addressed that with a line about how emergency hotlines only dispatch BLS rigs in arrest or prodromes when no ALS rigs were available, but I would assume that would lead to the same thing. The most sick people get ACLS by default, except where that isn't possible. 
"
medicine,"There’s always a balancing act, no doubt, and I also share your concern about unnecessary government overreach- anyone who practices modern medicine in America feels it.  "
medicine,"Hilarious, but please never say you’re just a nurse! Nurses are awesome and very smart!"
medicine,"You need to scare them. I ask them how long do they want to live. Then I explain that medicine can predict when a person is going to die based on the natural history of the disease. I try to guess when he is going to have an infarction, when he is going to die. I explain how it's gonna be, in this case witout a foot, feeling constipation, urine retention, blind, living like that for a few years until something more serious happen.

Show him images, make him understand his body is not only imortal, but he is very I'll and may have a terrible death.

I give them a number of years, I say I'm not they mother, they don't have to lie to me their life. If he wants to life like that's, it's his choice, but medicine will have nothing to help him later. If he wants help you are there.

This kind of speech can make them feel their doctor is giving up on them because it's useless to treat him. It can make things wost or not change anything, but hey, at least the guy was warned right? Its our responsibility to not only speak, but to make the patient understand the consequences.

The shake will surely make the person think harder, if that doesn't I don't understand what will."
medicine,Yes!
medicine,"I could imagine that taking every class ""over again"" would make me look like a genius."
medicine,"I know a pediatrician who graduated near the top of his class who could be this guy, except he isn't the only MD. He charges $$$ and takes limited insurance with no Medicaid. His practice is antivax, though that has carefully been removed recently. He sells supplements and vitamins for hundreds of dollars because he is holistic and integrative. He is also a Doterra consultant. Doterra is an essential oil pyramid scheme.

He knows better, but everyone has their price."
medicine,I am also thinking of this in a US setting.
medicine,"I realize it’s against the law now. I’d like a major overhaul, though. Any other business that’s attacked on these websites can respond. Physicians can’t.

medicine,"Patient called my colleague with bad rosacea who she didn't like ""That Freddy Krueger motherfucker."" 

I had to step out of the room I started laughing so hard."
medicine,"If it's so inaccurate then explain why you think it is so.  Many generalizations are accurate.  Doctors get paid more in America than in India. Generalization but almost always true.  Simply being a generalization is not a falsehood. "
medicine,"This is inaccurate; Munchausen's by proxy is diagnosable by a parent reporting symptoms or an illness in a child and demanding treatment for same when there is no actual diagnosable cause. Alfie Evans had a real, medically acknowledged condition that was confirmed to be terminal after careful review. 

This case is extremely sad and absolutely due to a genuine medical condition. This condition only became apparent to his parents at six months of age and additional treatment was requested in Italy, but not feasible give the baby's condition with regard to travel. 

At no point did either parent try to enforce a diagnosis that wasn't accurate. This kid was doomed. They did attempt to prolong life, which was denied. I am not weighing in on this request. Classifying this as a MbP case is fucked up, regardless of the parents' religious views with regard to ongoing care. These parents were not sabotaging their kid's care, they wanted to prolong it despite all data suggesting this was futile. 

Shame on you for trying to vilify grieving parents."
medicine,Removed under rule #2.
medicine,"I haven't been at any VA in years, but I remember CPRS fondly. Old and clunky, but also quick and reliable. I sometimes felt like it lacked obvious features, but I never felt like bloat was getting in my way."
medicine,I used to do EHR implementation... Giant clusterfuck would be a gross understatement.
medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4675355/#!po=51.1905
medicine,"I was a software dev at one of the leading small practice EHR companies and can provide some insight into the lack of portability. I left in 2016, but at that time the only incentive to add portability of patient records was Meaningful Use Stage 2 certification. In the few years I worked at that company there was not one sale I heard about where the ability to transfer records between providers was a deal breaker, but plenty of other features were. We integrated with many other EHRs because we also had a practice management solution when the others didn't, and even then nobody wanted to move towards a standard integration so we had a dozen different integration endpoints. Everything was hacked in.

With MU2 EHRs were supposed to add support for the HISP network and CCDA files for sending data back and forth, but the documentation around the CCDA format is a joke so everyone had slightly different implementations and the whole idea went down in flames. There was also the problem of EHRs not planning their software design around what was needed to reach MU2 certification and timelines for implementation were just too long. This caused the government to keep pushing back the deadline, and without that deadline there is no incentive to properly build out that functionality.

Also, EHR integrations with 3rd parties, such as labcorp and quest, are largely a joke because of the interfaces that those 3rd parties provide to get data are crap. The worst by far are clearing houses and insurance companies. I could rant for days about how difficult it was to automate the insurance payment pipelines because of how outdated and arcane their systems were.

Anyway, the reality is EHR systems are not nearly as easy to do right as all these startups like to think and portability is not at the top of any administrator's list of required pieces of functionality. If the government said ""You must use an EHR with these features or you can't get medicare/medicaid payments"" then you'll see that working within year. Unless that happens, proper record portability is probably another 5-10 years out."
medicine,"I don't think that doctors should disclose things against the wishes of the patient, even in this situation. (I assume that if someone was judged too mentally unfit to even give meaningful consent about their health info, that you would tell this to their next-of-kin or legal equivalent? Regardless of whether they were the president or not, I mean.)

What I have a problem with is the lying. I know ""astonishingly healthy"" is subjective, but ... still. It also seems very unlikely that he's actually the weight claimed.

If someone asked my doctor for my medical info, she'd just say ""it's illegal for me to disclose that information to you,"" not make up something about how ""astonishingly healthy"" I am. There's a difference between not disclosing my weight at all, and saying that I weigh 50 pounds less than I actually do.

If my doctor were writing a letter about my health, I assume she couldn't go against my wishes as to which health facts I wanted her to include or exclude. If I asked her to write a letter that cherry-picked my health information to the point that she felt it was unethical, then she could just refuse to write it at all. She doesn't have the right to disclose health info against my wishes, but I don't have the right to force her to do something that's ethically dubious.

So: I could ask her not to mention my anxiety disorder, and I'd expect her to either abide by my wishes and not include it, or refuse to write the letter. But if I asked her to say that I don't have any mental illnesses and am not taking an SSRI, I sure hope she wouldn't agree to write that!

Omission is fine. Even in the case of a disqualifying condition (for flying, or being president, or whatever), all that needs to be disclosed is that the person *is* disqualified, not *why*. Outright lying is another story, IMO."
medicine,"Oh and also, depending on your facility, you risk giving men anti-D. Our emergency procedures mean that only women under 50 and known Rh neg folks get O neg emergency blood. Without a type and screen or history, any bleeding man is going to get O pos, which sort of sucks from an antibody perspective but we simply don't have enough O neg to give it to everyone.

So, if they need it, screw the antibodies, it's better to make one than to bleed to death. But if it was just an erroneous value... Oops?"
medicine,"The older you get the more you realise, no one really knows for sure. We're all just trying to get by..."

medicine,"Yep. In smaller centres it's less of an issue as it's a bit of a ""first one's free"" situation, and then they get blocked if they repeatedly turn up wanting a bed to sleep in. Personally I disagree with this approach, I think it promotes escalation in suicidal behaviour and might actually increase mortality rates. "

medicine,"This is so on-brand, I can’t believe we didn’t predict it."
medicine,My favorite part of that article are the SMBs that didn’t have mental health questions on their surveys but said that diagnosis alone was enough to sanction an applicant. I wonder if the SMBs only backed down when spoken to on the phone because someone questioned it vs they actually believed most of the time a diagnosis doesn’t lead to sanctions. It’d be interesting if someone could look through the application records and see as a study.

medicine,"Rep lunches aren't a problem for me. Oh no. I recognize every single detail of their bias because of course I spent 6 hrs reading about the history of the studies and statistical manipulation a beforehand. It's aaaallllll the other people that are the problem ya see? /S "
medicine,"Everything is a thing.  However, people do not randomly tattoo DNR on themselves when in a drunken stupor.  They are more likely to have a dragon with breasts or a demon riding a Mermaid rather than the letters DNR or do not resuscitate.  Honestly I would favor a stick and poke DNR tattoo than one that is professionally done as an SNP takes longer and it is a very deliberate decision especially one of this choice."
medicine,Why not 11?
medicine,"Yea for an MI or something but not stuff that is surgery specific like a malunion or infection. "
medicine,Disagree. I don't even think hospitals know how much this stuff costs. It's all monopoly money.

medicine,DDAVP for a patient with hyponatremia? That's most certainly what you don't want to do.
medicine,"SOAP was mentioned at medical school but certainly wasn't held up as the definite model.

To be honest there really doesn't seem to be a standard format but they all (in medicine at least) go something along the lines of:

1) Problem list (acute and chronic if you're feeling fancy)

2) New blood results, scans, input from other specialties etc.

3) Patient reported progress (similar to S), new symptoms etc.

4) Examination

5) Impression/diagnosis/differential

6) Plan

So overall very similar to SOAP but less formally structured I suppose."
medicine,"Have you considered not buying and using illegal drugs made by criminals of unknown veracity and quality because they are bad for you. Point in case? You  took those drugs and ended up in here talking to me.

medicine,"Perhaps it’s strong to call anyone “feckless”.  While i agree protocols have their limitations, its strong and perhaps unnecessary language to use ad homenim when discussing the relative merits of goal-directed therapy. "
medicine,"Still, am I alone in thinking this is probably best first addressed on an interpersonal level between friends?

medicine,"I absolutely perceive that AI will have a huge role in the future of medicine. However the average physician doesn't need to know much about computer science as it's a whole field in itself that requires a lot of dedication and years of study to master. However, they'll probably be a small subset of physician computer scientists who will know both areas very well and can lead the change. Also I think that eventually they'll be some MD/PHD programs specialising in computer science applied to healthcare."

medicine,"How does an unregulated person even have a scope? "
medicine,"Its not meant to be ""overly condescending"", you're entitled to assess the data and risks yourself and decline screening or get it done privately. Rather, the question is a public health one of whether, in light of all these risks including over-diagnosis, it is a good use of limited healthcare resources to even offer such screening if there is little net benefit or even net harm done. Unfortunately as the current saga shows, it is politically unpalatable to change/cancel the screening programme even if empirical data were to suggest minimal benefits or harm."

medicine,Memento mori
medicine,I read up on it a few years back. I no longer remember the sources.
medicine,"Yes, I've seen multiple cases, as well as the ST elevation in every lead style, which looks more like a type III LAD \(wraparound LAD\) rather than pericarditis, as pericarditis rarely has elevation as prominent as the type you see caused by ICH. Each one of those cases had cath lab confirmed stress cardiomyopathy \(Takotsubos\)."
medicine,"Not a consultant, but I used to make a habit of it as a resident. PCPs really seem to enjoy the feedback and involvement. I frequently call from ED to let the PCP know I've sent their drug-seeker/functional patient home and to expect an angry visit shortly. Letting them know what I've already tested helps them with the impending angry visit and saves them time.

Slightly off topic... I recall as an intern on neurology/stroke rotation I called a PCP to let them know that aspirin was not an anticoagulant. Three of their patients presented within a month with acute ischaemic cardioembolic strokes - all had known AF; not anticoagulated. I was reasonably firm with the PCP stating that the risk of bleeding was outweighed by the risk of embolic stroke for each of these patients. That they should not be placing these ""young"" patients at such a high risk of cardioembolic strokes. ""Guides say this"" etc.

One month later I was working someone up down in ED with a haemorrhagic stroke... I'll be damned if it wasn't the same PCPs patient... this time appropriately prescribed Apixaban for AF.

Just about necked myself."
medicine,"When I worked there, it depended on which department you were in. Pathology had green."
medicine,"They both measure a concentration. The haematocrit (%) is always approximately 3 x greater that the Hb (g/dl). The important  point is that haematocrit does not tell you any more about 'dilution' than the haemoglobin, despite what generations of surgeons believe. "

But it's the efficiency of my charting that's preventing me from doing oral care."
medicine,"I think what you got wrong is that a hospital will pull life support based on a families ability to pay.  That’s simply not true.  "
medicine,"I don't see a reason why medical schools should provide a track per se (USA perspective). MD students can and do earn MS in computer science or art or math or whatever they're interested in. Trade off is longer time in school and more debt, might as well learn it in undergrad if you have the foresight"
medicine,"This was a pretty widely awaited trial. I was surprised I didn’t see any discussion of it on here. I think Larry cuts right to the point here:

&gt; The results will likely spark an intense controversy in the medical and cardiology community, since AF ablation has become a profitable revenue center in many cardiology practices.

Already we are seeing heated discussion about ITT vs PP analysis and pointing to secondary endpoints to justify AF ablation in the face of a missed primary endpoint.

This area isn’t my specialty, so I’m curious to hear how others are interpreting these results. Under what conditions will you consider AF ablation going forward? Has that changed due to CABANA?"
medicine,"From my understanding, there are STEMI (elevated) and NSTEMI (non elevated, depressed). NSTEMI occur due to blockage of minor coronary vessels or partial blockage of major vessels. This causes damage to internal myocardium. STEMI is caused by occlusion of a major coronary artery, which damages the entirety of the associated myocardium. Despite this NSTEMI is associated with a higher mortality (I’m not sure why, maybe it’s because it takes longer to differentiate it as an MI)"

Now it's just the ketamine they're on, and they seem to be quite normal. The other person, I'm not familiar with the backstory but it's the same physician that prescribed it. I truely believe that both individuals are better off with ketamine, and in the case of the first individual, saved their life as well as treating their pain."
medicine,"I KNEW IT. "
medicine,"As others have said, it increases error.

In essence, getting values ""straight from the source"" is always more accurate - any manipulation on the part of the user leads to increased error. When you do dilutions, you're assuming you have a truly homogeneous solution you're diluting, and, depending on how your machine takes a reading, you may need to account for whatever background signal your new solvent generates. There are also other things to consider, such as how accurate your pipettes are, etc."
medicine,"The government?

Lol. 

More like ""The person who isn't a doctor and has a cushy government job comes into a thread about doctor burnout and tells doctors that they should earn less money""."
medicine,"&gt; Honest question, if they came in late wouldn't they completely miss the market since half the day is 5am-12noon? 

Ideally the traders work in teams where individuals who sit out the morning can be covered by people who went home last night at a reasonable time.

&gt; Amazing if true, they should perpetuate that model somehow. My corp experience would be assuming that was a joke for interns. Horrible I have that view to.

This is definitely what they said.  Not clear on how many traders actually listened, we didn't study it or anything. Traders are a pretty macho bunch of money addicts and these sleep deprived times during crazy market activity are when heroes are born. Or some bullshit like that.
"

medicine,"I mean statistical significance, that is what a p-value of less than .05 means.  The p-value is the probability of the data given the null hypothesis.  That means if the probability is .05 or less that you would yield an effect size as large as the one you computed from a randomly drawn sample from a population where the effect size is exactly zero, we declare significance and reject the null hypothesis that the effect size is exactly zero or less in the population.

That allows you to generalize the findings to the representative population from which the random sample was drawn.  This is the statistics terminology, not the medical science terminology."

So he can justify his practice, he presumably wanted some ""peer-reviewed"" journal article he could point to in order to back up his claims. 

So it's simple, find some factor that fasting will obviously help in the short term (he could have also chosen cholesterol, for example) and then have your only time point of measurement be right at the end of the treatment course and provide no further follow-up. Ta-da, you have proof that can be used by alt-med quacks to justify fasting to cure cancer or something. "

You talk with no respect. Because my view is different to yours, you accuse me of not knowing how the Pharma industry works. Your post history is filled with anti-pharma posts and comments, with little detail or quality in there. You have a default negative view. Look at your post on Aimovig; you suggest that the product should not get approval because, from your point of view, it only works for 50% of patients. The fact that it works for 50% of patients is really good: you have a negative view anyway and distort what you read to give that narrative. 

I highly doubt you know ANYONE in the industry; if you were in Pharma you'd know better. People involved in the whole clinical trial process care about the work done. I implore you to reach out to any senior figure in HEOR or Market Access, these people work to get successful reimbursement for products whilst at the same time working in a larger scope to ensure the many proof of concept trials the companies want to start have the finances necessary to do so. You probably read Bad Pharma and thought everybody involved in the industry are evil people; they're far from that. You're an outsider looking in, with probably no idea what is involved in the Pharma industry aside from 'Cinical Trials to prove effiacy' and 'lol sales rep showing up must be straight to them after approval'. You have no insight on the industry from your position."

The pharmacy I was shadowing at was the only place in town that filled them because “we need the volume and they pay cash”. I hated that mentality and was glad to only be there for 2 weeks. 

I think it’s those cases that pharmacists are able to intervene and refuse a script to be filled because it’s consistently a week early every month. Now whether Prince’s case fits that is unclear.

medicine,"Hey everyone. A radiologist here.

Radiology might provide a model for how the EHR could have and should have been developed and deployed.

In the bad old days, every equipment vendor had their own internal format for data, and you printed the pictures off on expensive sheets of film that had to be stored in the big old file rooms.

The first attempts at coming up with an eletronic standard began in the early 80s. It was largely being driven by manufacturers wanting to sell interoperable imaging equipment, viewing workstations, and viewing equipment \(e.g. not top down government mandate\). I guess there were some false starts. The eventual standard was called DICOM, and didn't gain widespread traction until the 90s. Even then, there were many different dialects of DICOM, and it wasn't uncommon for a file generated on one type of equipment to be unviewable on another \(looking at you, color doppler ultrasound!\). Now things are pretty smooth. The dicom format has a header \(patient info, image equipment, parameter documentation\) that is pretty goofy, but it is a known thing and it works and you can mostly take a CD generated on one hospital's CT scanner an load it into another hospital's archive so that you can compare studies side\-by\-side.  There are still some incompatible equipment types, but those are mostly the el\-cheapo office CT scanners they market to dentists and ENTs.

DICOM provides a documented, interchangeable file format. There was never going to be exchangable medical records without having a documented, freely\-available file format.  Instead, as someone else mentioned here, we have scan\-to\-pdf. UGH!

Do EHRs still charge you money to export patient data? I think there's some of the smaller ones that charge extra for exporting and or for running database queries on \*your own patient's information\*. This seriously shouldn't be a thing. But I think a lot of docs fall for the pretty marketing girl that brings your staff Subway sandwiches for lunch, and then you get de\-leveraged from your own practice.  


Edit: The point I think I was trying to make here is that, with PACS and DICOM, the radiology community \(including vendors\) were specifically working on inter\-operability. Whereas my experience with the medical records people suggests that those vendors are more than happy to use vendor lock\-in to make the sites that install their EHR \(unwilling\) customers for life.

Radiologists are a nerdy, largely computer savvy bunch.  We have more people actively involved with the process and who understand what leads to efficienty, and who can call bullshit when marketing people tell us their shit doesn't stink. We are focused on productivity and on going home on time, so when things are inefficient, the pitchforks and torches come out quickly. Yeah, I get it, pumping pictures from one place to another seems like a simple problem, but patient records are basically long detailed emails.

The government doesn't understand this problem. I get the feeling that most doctors are happy just writing notes for themselves, and don't really care about the quality of the record, \*per se\*.  So, perhaps, in not taking ownership of the problem as soon as it stopped being \*their\* problem, they left the solution to people who don't understand the problem.

Seriously. Open Source software is a thing. There are free databases and XML file formats that make putting together a comprehensive, extensible data format together no more difficult that understanding the scope of the data and organizing your thinking. Why isn't some group of medical boards putting together a group of people to make up a standardized patient information format? Let it be a 10 year project. Have a working group that has to review and approve the tags and code words so that search terms that work at one hospital work at another. Bake in the assumption that certain organizational paradigms that work today will change in the future, and we'd want to retrospectively reclassify things.  Then: let the commercial companies compete for who can have the best interface for putting data in and pulling data out. Make it so one set of clinicians have one interface, the surgeons have another, and the billing people have still another. You know there are programs that have scriptable interfaces? So, say, if a particular clinic has one particular set of actions that they \*always\* do over and over, you could hire someone to code a short bit of Python and those multiple steps collapse down into one button?

The possibilities are endless. But first you'd need to bring together a group of people with understanding, authority, and funding.

This is a common misconception. Your contract is paused if you lose your job and you have to go to a new NHSC site before your time accrual starts again. Illness, getting fired, clinics closing, constructive discharge, family leave, are all things that happen and as long as you contact them and then go to a new NHSC site the only problem will be is that your time accrual was paused between jobs.

I do, however, struggle with the decision to forbid transfer to Italy.

I also agree that the transfer would likely precipitate a seizure and possible ensuing status. The NHS doctors were absolutely correct in their prognosis.

But the transfer of Alfie would not impose financial harm on the patient, family, or even the UK. The transfer's potential medical harm, while existentially valid, shouldn't preclude transfer to different facilities (e.g. I'm aware of inter-hospital transfers in the states for- admittedly less bleak- cases where the transfer would be perilous and of limited clinical utility).

 And, I do think relative harm should be considered in the context of existing neurological devastation; that is- if he were to suffer a seizure (while under the medical responsibility of the Italians, mind you), are we definitively able to say that it was iatrogenic or simply the end stages of his existing disease process?

I don't know. I'd love to hear people's opinion on this.

medicine,"&gt; Somehow I don't think up to 10 years of residency following medical school is going to attract more people to become physicians.


We have a vast overabundance of applicants to the physician training system, not the other way around.  It's untrue to pretend we _won't have doctors_ anymore if we treat them decently and extend residency.  And maybe residency wouldn't be so awful if we didn't have SCOTUS ruling that ERAS and residency have a _UNIQUE_ exception to Federal anti-trust laws which force wages to near poverty levels.  Residents are not paid commensurate to their training nor to their profit generation because normal legal protections are voided.

https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/us/antitrust-lawsuit-over-medical-residency-system-is-dismissed.html


And if total training length is the concern you have, may I suggest we target the 4 years minimum Americans spend in bullshit humanities and zoology 101 classes in undergraduate?  I don't think spending 48 months being forced to take ""diversity studies"" and classes on the French Revolution (while fun) was necessary.  Cut that to one year focusing on organic chem and biology, use that saved three years for more resident-level training.  Also remove 90% of the current biochem curriculum from pre-clinical education.  Spending 6 months memorizing every enzyme name and carbon atom altered in the fucking Krebs cycle _is not a good use of our time_.  "

medicine,Can you explain this further?
medicine,"An MD is an MD is an MD is an MD. That being said, doctors are ""credentialed"" for different things, so that's how our ""scope"" is defined, e.g. you might be credentialed to take care of patients in an ICU and perform procedures such as central lines, arterial lines, etc, or you might be credentialed to work in an OR and perform appendectomies. A lot of medications are also bound to certain fields, e.g. non-oncologists will typically have a tough time ordering any chemotherapy (even if they *technically* are allowed to), non-electrophysiologists will have a tough time with tikosyn, etc. "

I think you'd get a much more consistent documentation if you incorporated verbal charting inside of a patient's room-- at least on day shift. night shift you'd have to have some sort of low volume thingy. 

Providers jobs are focused on synthesizing the data that nursing provides in order to make informed decisions. I am a little more skeptical here that verbal EMR would work, but, then again, I'm not a provider. "

medicine,Wow you're a huge piece of shit. I hope that you don't get surgery from a surgeon in their 80th work week hour.
medicine,What do you do now?
medicine,"Physicians are organized less in terms of level of care they're allowed to give and more so in terms of what area of care they're allowed to practice.

The 'level' that really counts is a board certification. Someone that's board certified in psychiatry is generally regarded as competent to practice psychiatry, and they can generally get privileges to legally practice. But, that person can't just go and do general surgery, which requires its own board certification. They are limited to the scope of their specialty. 

So, when someone graduates with an MD, even though they are a doctor, they aren't really qualified to practice much medicine. They do some years as residents practicing underneath board certified physicians (called attendings when they're teaching) until they've trained enough to have the experience and knowledge to take the boards themselves. Once they've done that, they can practice their specialty independently.

So yes two people within the same specialty can basically do the same things (not counting that people can subspecialize and focus on certain things)."

CMS’s new payment model aims to improve quality of patient care by completely replacing the fee-per-service model with patient-centered surveys of care.

medicine,"I was under the impression that dermatology was paid so well due to a combination of quick procedures and the ability to do many appointments quickly (often just for a medication refill). Even *if* this were lead to the total elimination of skin cancer screening and diagnosis visits, I doubt it would cut into dermatologists' practice much. 

In fact, if this lead to wider screening for melanoma (say in primary care offices), it could potentially lead to more melanomas being caught at operable stages so that dermatologists would actually have more to do (and be able to do more good, since early intervention into melanoma can be lifesaving)."

medicine,"Remember that those are counting on-call hours spent in the hospital, which is fairly common for American residents (though not attendings). Even if you're asleep all night (or most of it), it counts as an hour at work. I certainly blew past 80 hours often enough, but I almost never actually *worked* that many.

I've done it in private practice, but again, that's almost always because I am required to stay in the hospital while an epidural is running. We don't do trauma, and it is very rare for us to be doing emergency after emergency after 2100 for multiple nights in a row (weekend call is 0700 Friday to 0700 Monday).

I do get substantially more than three weeks of vacation. I've had a job that only gave three, but it was not at all demanding. You had to be there, but you were very rarely there more than eight hours a day, and call was split among a very large number of people, so even with two attendings on call and in-house per night, it worked out to about once every two to three weeks."
medicine,"Fair enough, I was looking at it from the residency perspective where you have to be in the hospital during call."

It makes me study harder to make up for those judgments.

medicine,"***highlight of the study***

In general, the data on the popular supplements (multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin C) show no consistent benefit for the prevention of CVD, MI, or stroke, nor was there a benefit for all-cause mortality to support their continued use. At the same time, folic acid alone and B-vitamins with folic acid, B6, and B12 reduced stroke, whereas niacin and antioxidants were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Overall, the effects were small; the convincing lack of benefit of vitamin D on all-cause mortality is probably the reason for the lack of further studies published since 2013. However, a number of trials with high doses (2,000 IU/day) are underway (e.g., VITAL [Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial]; NCT01169259). The effects of folic acid in reducing stroke is also convincing, with a 20% reduction."

If airway was the only concern, now that it's established you're in a good position and have lots of time to sort out the plan. Talk with your receiving hospital about what to do. A few ties around the tube should be good, but you could throw a suture in as well. You could also cut the tube shorter if you used a regular 6 ETT, so it doesn't look as ridiculous.

medicine,"So like u/thekuch1144 pointed out, it's for billing \(and, ugh, in particular it's popular to get the 1997 detailed exam, which can be met by two bullets from six organ system \-\- so normocephalic AND atraumatic\).

But as part of an episode that I'm working on \(which is nowhere near ready to be released\) about the powers of observation, I actually did a deep dive into the history of the term ""normocephalic"". Because if you think about it, it's really strange that we use it out of pediatrics. It technically means ""not microcephalic"" \(and in fact, if you look at how it was initially used, it was almost all in pediatrics\). But that doesn't really make sense for adults. So how did it become common?

So as best as I've been able to track down, documenting skulls as normocephalic comes from the idea of the cephalic index, which was developed in the early 19th century by Anders Retzius. He was a polymath, and made lots of contributions, especially in zoology and comparative biology \-\- but for our purposes, was also very important in anthropology.  He studies collections of historic and prehistoric skulls found in Europe, and he realized that their dimensions fell into a distribution. In particular, he developed the cephalic index \-\- radio of the length to the width of the skull. A small ratio was brachiocephalic, and large ratios were dolichocephalic. 

Almost from the beginning, this was used to classify humanity by intelligence; Retzius himself felt that the most dolichocephalic people were naturally superior \(which he, of course, as a Swede he identified as Northern Europeans\). The more brachycephalic people were inferior \(which he identified with sub\-Saharan Africa\). There are crazy maps online classifying all humanity by the cephalic index.

Soon a new category was added to the cephalic index \-\- mesocephalic. And measurement of the cephalic index was the initial test of cranioscopy, invented by Franz Joseph Gall, and the beginning of phrenology.

So describing a person as mesocephalic on the physical exam was a cranioscopic term, and not terribly uncommon throughout the nineteenth and early 20th century. So this is not my original thesis \(I first say it in Sapira's Art and Science of Bedside Diagnosis\) but it appears that starting in the 1940s, the word normocephalic began to be used as a synonym for mesocephalic in describing adult heads and moving out of the pediatric literature.  This is backed up by Google n\-grams, which shows a dramatic increase around this time period. And I've pulled a couple medical dictionaries from the 1970s that still list normocephalic as a synonym for mesocephalic. I'm speculating at this point, but by the 20th century, mesocephalic was likely too tarnished by phrenologic and racial connotations. The word normocephalic, therefore, was a perfectly good loan word to use, absent these connotations.

I would also add that the cephalic index is used still in measuring fetal heads \(I believe \-\- it's been a long time since I was in that position\), and that brachio\- meso\- and dolichocephalic are still commonly used terms with dogs.

Again \-\- it's the dictats of medicare billing that have really made it take off. But next time you write NCAT, you'll have a little more to think about.

Sorry \-\- that was a tangent! There's so much interesting history buried in so much of the things we just do without thinking."

Drugs can already be approved by the FDA based on strong performance in a phase II trial, even before official publication. If we are going to restrict the open access paradigm to indications that have the support of peer reviewed evidence, there will be a very small subset of drugs that have not already been taken through FDA approval process \(bevacizumab for mesothelioma comes to mind \- drug company never sought approval despite decent evidence due to the drug being late in its patent cycle\). If that were the case, I don't think it is very different than the current system. Any efforts to speed up the approval process after the appropriate data is collected and reviewed would be a good thing.

On the other hand, releasing drugs to well intentioned but medically illiterate patients when even their doctors barely understand the physiology is hardly autonomy. One must be informed to fully exercise autonomy, and how can the patient be informed if the evidence doesn't exist?"
medicine,"The CME is not the part that bothers me--honestly, I would probably do about the same amount of on-going education regardless of the requirement.

The licensure stuff is super irritating. I wish we could go the way of our Nursing colleagues and just have one nationwide license.  That's probably a pipe-dream though.  

What bothers me the most is everything else--the nonsensical medical record reviews or random research stuff and on-going multiple choice tests!  And the professional association fee!  Gah! I am a part of my state medical association, but I feel WAY more tied in with  my state association--they even regularly poll the entire association for their actual stance on topics.  Even controversial stuff like physician assisted suicide or legalization of marijuana has been put up for vote and comment by the entire state medical society!  How cool is that?  I never feel like I get to have meaningful input into my national society.  They just exist and suck money. "

medicine,"The nurse has probably been reamed by that same attending before. I worked with a very high strung MD regularly and knew exactly how he wanted his patients managed and how to handle his moods. One day a brand new cardiology resident put in orders on my patient that I knew this nephrologist would loose his mind over (it was an inappropriate fluid order).  So I kindly explained why the order was inappropriate and what order he should put in, he changed it to the correct order. About 45 minutes later my nephrologist saw the old canceled order and the new one.  I explained to him what had happened, he was pissed and went looking for the resident to yell at. Thankfully the poor resident had already left the floor. "

We had an old pathologist that was so bored at work one day he wrote a report on a cucumber that was stuck in someone’s rectum (why the ER ordered pathology I’ll never know). But he went all out on that thing. Length, width, circumference, number of seeds, color, class/family/genus/species. It was hilarious to read the thing.

It’s cool to hear your experience, though, so thanks for that. I didn’t know pathologists could be as busy as you say. "
medicine,"The argument is that fewer missed and delayed injuries occur if you pan scan pretty much every code 1 or 2 trauma.  MVC, fall &gt; 15 feet, gsw, etc., per that trial.

In pregnant women, a missed bowel injury because you tried to do serial abdominal exams instead of just CT-ing the abdomen would be catastrophic, and far more risky than the scan.  Better to ex-lap fast and resect the injured bowel before peritonitis sets in.

And the reality is that few trauma teams will really take the time to discuss all this with the patient, at least in major trauma.  Because in many cases, blood loss and/or head injury can diminish the patient's capacity to refuse a life saving CT scan anyway, and you can't be sure them refusing the scan is not from altered mental status.  I have never seen anyone counseled about a CT scan before we do it at either trauma center I have worked at.  And in at least one court case, this policy of assuming diminished capacity in trauma patients has been backed up by the courts:

First of all, not every patient can get into a clinical trial. It depends on if your center participates in it or not.

Uh, no. It's because drug companies want a clean trial with as few confounding adverse events. Your argument here is terrible.

In my view, Dr Aribindi is adding to the sad generalisation that surgeons are morons who know boring physiology well and hate confronting reality. 

This is not reality, I know. An engaged, thoughtful, experienced surgeon is the most beloved colleague an intensivist can have. And we all know you need like eight PhDs before you're allowed to tie a knot in orthopaedics. But fuck me, this guy is all the bad stereotypes of bad surgeons and idiot provincial American attitudes you could ask for. 

The problem is that the writing is, shockingly, 'not even wrong'. These weren't the issues at hand. This is bad analysis of bad press reporting. And the conclusions are wrong anyway! State funded health systems *don't* and *explicitly should not* make cost based decisions for individual patients. The cost *wasn't the problem anyway*. The economics of one patient being an issue for first world state's health funding model is *farcical*. 

And then he fucking *Godwinned*, appealing to Hitler instead of understanding the issue of burdensome medical care. You cannot force paediatricians to actively work against their patient's interest; he fails to acknowledge their expertise in judging their medical conclusion. No medical justification is given for transport.

I also know doctors who are smart, probably worked hard in school/residency when there was a grade or evaluation, but slack off when there's little to no benefit (usually financially) to them.

Easily, so having a specialty with a sense of variety in what they see would be a huuuge plus as well. This lead me to consider Rads, and IM (with the intention of becoming a hospitalist maybe) Here are my concerns-


Rads- more difficult to get into, pretty long training time esp if I go for fellowships- which I hear is becoming mandatory to get a job in rads (is this true...?)


IM: the culture of IM in my country vs the US is quite different, I imagine. I have an elective lined up late summer so I guess I’ll see for sure, but I here it’s socially quite taxing and more intense than rads. On the plus side, I could potentially have a job lined up after 3 years (or go for a fellowship, if I decide).

medicine,"I always hear this argument and I think it can be debated, at least statistically.  A quick look at KFF, and there are ~130k  FM/GP's.  With 300M adult population, that's about 2300 patients per physician.  A touch high but not absurd.  Add the IM docs who are PCP's and subtract the healthy young adults who don't see their PCP, and that 2300 number can come down to something reasonable. Additionally, according to NRMP the recent match had about 3300 FM resident spots.  If a FM doc works 30 years and each year the supply is replenished by 3300 new docs, that's an average of 100k FM docs at any given time, roughly. Not quite high enough, but not terrible, add in the IM PCP's and that gap narrows.  Obviously the math isn't perfect and there are some grey areas.  I think the bigger issue really is distribution."

I would argue that the physical act of going to the doctor is a neutral experience, at best. Triage could be done from the comfort of your home. Waiting times could be massively reduced. Cost of healthcare would plummet - everyone can get an initial assessment for zero cost to whoever's providing the AI. Many missed diseases would be picked up, and I wouldn't be surprised if cancer was recognised earlier.

Issues with binary questions not working is an initial hurdle, but not impossible to get over. Likert scales work, as does a different phrase. That's very very easy to test - you simply get 100 patients who may have a specific problem, ask them a few variations of a question, then get a doctor (or multiple doctors) to assess and diagnose them. See how well each question correlates to the diagnosis and test further to calculate a PPV, NPV, sensitivity &amp; specificity."

[Here is a larger version from the Wellcome Library](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/rcq5tvhq?query=M0007286&amp;wellcomeImagesUrl=GET%20/indexplus/image/M0007286.html%20HTTP/1.1). Examination of urine was a fundamental part of the physical exam prior to the 19th century. Urine was thought to be the result of “concoction” \(or pepsis\), the normal breakdown of the four humors. By examination of urine, a physician could hope to glean hints about the inner makeup of the humors. Uroscopy was so ubiquitous that [the matula](http://www.lamortdanslart.com/danse/Allemagne/Lubeck/dm_lubeck_milde5.jpg) \-\- the long\-necked container that physicians would use to store and examine urine in \-\- became the de facto symbol of the profession, much as the stethoscope is today \(that image of a doctor with a matula was from the Dance of Death mural from a covered bridge in Lubeck, which was unfortunately destroyed in World War II \-\- also cool because the skyline is basically unchanged to this day\). The development of the printing press dramatically popularized uroscopy, as color charts could be widely distributed and interpreted by all sorts of lay providers, including fortune tellers \(derisively called “pisse prophets” by Robert Burton in the Anatomy of Melancholy\). 

This woodprint in particular is taken from a similar chart in Pinder’s book in a section on uroscopy. The original reads \(I don’t read Latin so this translation comes from the original book \-\- so apologies if it doesn’t match up completely\)

Uroscopy is usually associated with medieval medicine, but it lasted well into the 19th century.

Some scholars have suggested that uroscopy, and the focus on black urine in particular, likely lead to humoral theory persisting longer than it would have otherwise. There was an intense focus on urina nigra \(black urine\), which appeared to be the only sign of the otherwise mysterious black bile.

Uroscopy rapidly died out, for two reasons. First, chemistry became increasingly sophisticated, and these colors of urine were subdivided into their causal agents. Urina nigra, for example, was subdivided first into hemoglobinuria \(1854\), melanuria \(1858\), alkaptonuria \(1859\), porphyrinuria \(c1870\), and then myglobinuria \(c1920\). But more importantly, the physical exam as we know it was developed \-\- an exam that attempted to identify pathology in still\-living patients, rather than identify obscure humoral dyscrasias. This transition \-\- how we went from medieval uroscopy to essentially the physical exam we have today in just about 20 years \-\- is the topic of the latest episode of [my podcast](http://bedside-rounds.org/episode-34-the-physical/).

medicine,"Well hang in there, friend! My girlfriend is an MD and she is a director of health education at a non\-profit and she's happy. She mostly just writes grants and works maybe 35 hours a week. There are a lot of opportunities out there for you. The former ER doc I met was actually doing allergy testing and sublingual immunotherapy, which was still ""experimental"" in this US but it's been approved in Europe for decades. So for the most part, he didn't even have to deal with insurance.  

I know another MD that started an eating disorder clinic and she's making a ton of money despite being god awful at management. Figuring out something that's outside the norm will make it a lot easier to excel. 

Anyway, good luck and best wishes!"
medicine,"Sounds like you just have a bad Walmart. Corporate policy is to accept discount cards presented by the patient. Also know that the price good Rx advertises is just a quote and they have a small print disclaimer that it may not be accurate. I've had instances of processing them through and getting higher prices. I've tried calling good Rx for patients and they tell me to use an ndc that's no longer on the market to get that price. "

medicine,"&gt; Have you followed the Ionis/Roche antisense HTT drug?

Data from the Phase I/IIa trial demonstrated they could lower the mutant huntingtin protein in the CSF 35-55% with monthly intrathecal injections over 13 weeks.  

HD is one of the few diseases where we unquestionably know it is the mutant gene and its translation into protein that is THE cause.  The true question remaining is whether 35-55% reduction of the mutant protein AFTER symptoms of onset is enough to give these poor souls some relief and alter the course of the disease.  

Their ASO targets both forms of the huntingtin mRNA - wild type and mutant so it remains to be seen if reducing the wild type has any bad effects.  However, once you are developed, the wild type huntingtin protein doesn't appear to be needed, as transgenic mouse models with conditional knockout of it during adulthood don't show any signs of problems.

medicine,"Like I said, I understand your frustration behind the counter, but there's a huge amount of money saved by aggregate negotiation, and because you're behind the counter you have zero visibility into that process. You have an emotional reaction based on a narrow perspective, and I get it, but that's not an accurate assessment of the way PBMs operate."
medicine,"So if I'm looking at this correctly, the only significant difference between the two groups was a higher incidence of AKI in the restricted group, but no significant difference in RRT or other major complications. 

Additionally, there's this line that I'm trying to make sense of: 

&gt; The risk of acute kidney injury was largely unaffected by the assigned treatment if postoperative creatinine values were not adjusted according to fluid balance 

To me that seems to be saying that the rate of AKI is no longer significant if you adjust for the effects of fluid balance on creatinine. Am I reading that wrong?

Lastly, the protocol for hypotension in the restricted group seems to be colloids and a lower threshold for pressors, which in my mind is what's driving the bump in Cr in those patients. 

To me, the study isn't saying ""give liberal fluids"" to post-op patients, it's saying ""don't withhold fluids from a hypotensive patient"". "
medicine,"Patients aren't bound by HIPAA.  It's why they can post any kind of ridiculous review online with no repercussions, but you cannot respond with any details."
medicine,Exactly. Practice makes perfect. It doesn't matter if you do some of the examination out of order as long as you do it confidently and make the patient feel like this is the billionth time you have done this.
medicine,"What's been your experience with ketamine for RSI induction vs the typical regimen of etomidate/versed? Also, do you routinely use atropine with it, or are secretions rarer than the books make it seem?"
medicine,"1) Why is the patient bradycardic? 

* Vagal.
* Inferior infarct that compromises sinus node/ AV node... as in sinus bradycardia /AV block. 
* Chronic therapies (beta-blockers, etc). 

2) How is perfusion?

* Adequate: ok. No stress. Just take him to the lab.
* Inadequate.

3) Why is the cardiac output inadequate?

* Bradycardia.
* Poor contractility. 
* Both.
* Mechanical complications (cardiac rupture, cardiac tamponade...).

So if we assume that we are in a prehospital setting, perfusion is poor and we exclude AV block as the cause I would:

* Assess airway and breathing. Supplement with oxygen if required. 
* Small fluid bolus + noradrenaline infusion.
* Manage of pain.
* Run to the cath-lab to get him the treatment that can fix his problems. 
* Keep on reassessing ABCDE. Respiratory support (non-invasive/invasive) if required. 
* I would only use atropine in a pre-arrest setting (sinus bradycardia progressively getting slower, with worsening symptoms), not in a stable bradycardia. 

In the ICU/cath-lab during PCI (we want a successful PCI at all costs):

* Is his perfusion still bad? Shit! Echocardiography, advanced monitoring, investigate what drugs he's taking at home... Rule out mechanical complications. 
* Add dobutamine if appropriate (even if it means increasing noradrenaline dose, reassess effects on perfusion). More fluids if appropriate (right ventricle involvement?).
* Mechanical support.

medicine,"One of the things I find very funny about psych is white coat culture. Some psych hospitals insist that everyone wear one. Some hospitals insist on the opposite and have no white coats. In general I've found that free\-standing psych facilities tend to be more anti\-coat and psychiatry services and units in general hospitals are more likely to be coat\-wearers, but it's not universal.

I've noticed that for non\-surgical services, especially residents, often the culture is to wear scrubs when on call and business casual otherwise. It's less about infection control and more about comfort and signalling ""I'm on or post\-call, don't bother me needlessly.""

For outpatient clinics, it's variable. Some doctors wear white coats; again, this seems more true in hospital\-associated clinics. Many will wear business casual, and older physicians tend more towards suits. Surgeons are usually the only ones I've seen wearing scrubs."

medicine,"No, you get all of the individual alleles with exome sequencing. 

The clinical question is irrelevant. My point is that the vast majority of disease entities can’t be explained by genetics. That means that the allele does not explain the incidence or severity of disease in the general population. Even the ones that people have found only explain less than 10% of the variation in data. "

But as I walked through the waiting room a few minutes later to call the next patient back, the lady slipped me a piece of paper. It was a hand-written note expressing her gratitude because ""nobody listens to old people anymore."" I kept that note on my fridge for years and still have it, and it still makes me smile."

medicine,"&gt; trouble is doctors need independence to do their job, but also need processes to manage their quality of work.

What do you mean by processes to manage their quality of work? Isn't that what doctors are specifically trained to do? I don't see how someone that isn't a physician can properly evaluate the quality of a physician's work. If physicians were being given tools to perform more efficiently and provide better patient care, I think they'd be happy to have that assistance. From what I've seen, a lot of management's goal is to increase revenue, not increase patient quality of care.

medicine,"Insurance, in a word.  Your doctor screws up, gets sued.  Oh, but I was depressed, he says.  So the hospital becomes liable for hiring someone who was mentally unfit. To avoid liability, don’t hire people with mental health issues.

medicine,"No of course it's important to offer IP psych care. But a 5-7 day IP stay is *not* ""treatment*.  It's an intervention. It's an important tool. But it's a very blunt tool.  It interrupts a dangerous process. Like intervening with a stroke or a broken femur or whatever.  
 
Major surg/med cases don't get discharged a bus ticket, a leaflet of walk-in clinics and a three-day supply of medications after their tests come back stable for 24 hours.  
 
Intervention is not treatment. It's an emergency measure. Treatment is what *should* follow intervention.  Without treatment, meaningful recovery is pretty darned rare. "
medicine,"That's really interesting! Although I'm still just a student and don't have that much experience, I found Chicago Med cringe-inducingly poor from a medical point of view.

Initially I thought it was pretty decent, but it became over-the-top dramatic very soon. When one of the doctors resuscitated a a terminal cancer patient with a standing DNR-order just because he felt she could benefit from a drug trial, *and kept his job*, I rage quit. Haven't watched since."

medicine,"&gt; Midwives don't practice in a vacuum without OB and MFM backup,

I think you need to be careful here. YOU don’t practice in a vac without backup. YOUR GROUP doesn’t either. The same cannot be said for midwives around the country. State laws are vastly different and some midwives may need a year of training while in another state it only takes 2 weeks of training to be “certified”. Some midwifery centers will absolutely not refer to OB when indicated. This is where bad outcomes happen. His question is valid because while you don’t practice without backup and thus, it is safe (I agree with that) this is not the case everywhere for all midwives. "

I was mistaken in my prior comment - the level 1 review showed a trend toward increased morbidity with resident duty hours limited to 12 in a single shift but it wasn't statistically significant.  [This review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4597944/) showed that limiting duty hours had no benefit to resident wellness and had a detrimental effect on education.

Like I've said elsewhere in this thread, I can only speak to my personal experience and that of my colleagues.  We all infinitely preferred being able to transition to 24 hour call shifts after intern year.  Working 16 hours straight 5 days a week is much, much tougher than working a 24 hour shift, getting a little bit of sleep over night, and then having the entire day off the next day to relax and take care of errands and such."

receive the cure that I am in UK, he told me
That I will pay for the delivery service.  The courier service can
transport it to me so he told me the amount I will pay, so my dad paid
for the delivery fee. two days later I receive the cure from the
courier service so I used it as the herbal man instructed me to,

When you consider these trials and others, and a [meta analysis showing benefit of tPA](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)60584-5/abstract) there is a strong signal indicating benefit of tPA. I apologize if I sound rude on the internet. It just frustrates me hearing physicians downplay clinical trial data. 

I would agree that any ICH is concerning to me, but there has not been any conclusive evidence to date that HI-1, HI-2, or PH-1 hemorrhages are associated with unfavorable long term outcomes. Only PH-2 which occur in symptomatic ICH.

medicine,"Some thoughts: 

1) This doesn't take compound interest into account. The impact of those dollars that the RN/PA's socking away right out of the gate in their early 20s is *huge*. [This link](http://www.mymoneyblog.com/power-of-compound-interest-2.html), while a bit clickbaity, gives a good example. 

2) The discrepancy between RNs/PAs and MDs is also much less than it seems due to the higher marginal tax rates for physicians, as others have mentioned. Plus physicians are more likely to have to contend with the alternative minimum tax and other awfulness in the tax code. 

3) In urban and other HCOL areas, and particularly at academic centers, the pay gap between RNs and physicians is also much less pronounced. Case in point: newly minted RNs at UCSF make 130K/year, plus benefits, including a crazy generous pension. With some experience (+/- taking on management responsibilities) this can go up to 200K/year and even a bit higher than that, depending on how much overtime you're willing to pull.; don't get me started on how much CRNAs can earn there. 

Meanwhile, starting salaries for attendings in IM and IM subspecialties at UCSF is about the same at around 130K/year, maybe a bit more. Even outside academic settings in HCOL areas, there's a lot of downward wage pressure on physicians because of all the competition; I know a couple of orthos who struggle to break 400K/year in the SF Bay Area, which is kind of nuts to me. Not to mention that getting a job in some specialties is basically all but impossible (exhibit A: radonc). "
medicine,"Let me rephrase for you.  ""Hi Dr. X, I saw the patient and spoke with the fellow but wanted to ensure you are in the loop as I am very concerned about the patient.  The patient appears ABC, the fellows plan was XYZ.  Is there anything else you feel we may be missing?  I am worried about ABC.""

You need to make it so any potential bad outcome is on the fellow and the attending for blowing you off.  9 times out of 10 you are wrong and their management is correct, so don't come from a point of confrontation.  The goal is simply to 'load the boat' in case things go poorly.  The fellow occasionally is wrong, and yes you can be blamed for not making the attending aware."

medicine,"Monitoring anything by itself doesn't improve outcomes, but basing treatment on objective parameters does e.g. restrospective analysis of FACTT trial in ARDS. CVP has multiple situations where it may not correlate with wedge pressure, but it can certainly give some information when it's very low or when it's very high.

Similar arguments were made against PA catheters -- monitoring doesn't improve mortality. But the problem, again, is that trials looking at PA monitoring didn't exactly have the most robust implementation (or in some case, any implementation) of protocols relating numbers (RA, PAOP) to treatment (fluids or diuretics).

And my point isn't that CVP is or isn't useful, there's certainly room for variance in one's philospophy of critical care, it's more that Marik made his mind up long ago, and has made a good chunk of his academic career out of naysaying CVP. "

medicine,"Because if the healthy 20 year old had seriously thought out his wishes, he'd actual spend the time/effort to get official DNR papers logged into the system rather than a tattoo that has no legal basis or can be ""misinterpreted"".  

Furthermore, the stakes are far higher for a young healthy 20 year old with a possible full life ahead of him vs. a 91 year old with multiple co-morbidities and poor prognosis.  As a result, the threshold in which you decide to withdraw care for a 20 year old should be far higher and done through an avenue that shows proper thought/consideration to the decision (aka. the legal way) as opposed to a tattoo (although, I do feel tattoos are iffy on everyone imo).  Regardless, a 20 year old who needs to be intubated due to an unusually bad asthma attack but is easily save-able vs. a 70 year old with metabolic acidosis of 6.8 for several hours/CHF with an ejection fraction of 20% (+ whatever else you want to throw in there) are two entirely different scenarios.

Also keep in mind, it is easy to theorize about such things behind the safety of your own computer.  It is different when you are the one in the hospital making the life and death situation."
medicine,"RN here. Sat in on an RCA recently and found out a nurse tried to tell the MD that a patient needed to be shipped out to a higher acuity facility. PT came to us in cardiogenic shock, elevated troponin NSTEMI, s/p bypass a couple weeks ago. We put in an emergent impella and a couple stents. PT was A&amp;O prior to case and coded during d/t his heart just giving out. The RNs in ICU, yes critical care nurses, said they didn't feel comfortable taking care of the patient when CRRT was added on top of impella. So the PT should be shipped out. Because yeah that's how that works. The MD just sends them off without oh say an accepting physician or being stable enough to transport. No the PT was not a candidate for transport and the RNs on the unit do NOT make that decision. They had a rep for the device present as well as the interventional  cardiologist. They were well supported. Yes, the patient died, because their heart couldn't take anymore! The whole thing was just nuts to me. The ICU RNs in my facility want the ICU title but not the responsibility and yet want to think they know more than the MD. No wonder MDs are feeling this way dealing with this kind of BS."
medicine,"&gt; Pay for delay allows pharma to pay generics to not put one on the market. When pharma agrees to not compete. 

Sure there’s a lot of anti competitive actions taken by big pharma, but the fact still holds that 89% of all medications taken are generic and that those prices are generally quite low. In fact generics in the US are less expensive than generics in many other developed countries like Canada

&gt; For two, you have an assumption. The assumption that as a single company increases its marketing, its revenue increases, increasing the overall cost of healthcare in the US; but eventually it will lower its price so far that the price decrease is larger than the marketing costs. And if that isn't it, multiple companies will somehow magically sprout the ability to market this drug as well, and then repeat over multiple companies until the price decreases? I have to say I've heard some wild things about pharma on Reddit before, but this is a wild one I've not ever heard

Well then you’ve sure hidden yourself in a closet. Just because you don’t understand Econ101 doesn’t make anything I’ve said controversial. You provide hyperbole in restating my argument but the fact is nothing there is controversial. Marketing increase demand. Increased demand drives down prices. Drugs going generic increase supply, which also drives down prices. And big pharma can fight all they want, but eventually everything becomes generic. You laugh that you’ve never heard this before when all I’m doing is describing anything you’d learn in healthcare economics 101. 

&gt; Over 5 years spent in the industry, several pharma and research classes, several books on the industry read, and not once

Highly doubtful. You’re literally going to claim years spent in the industry and not once someone talked about supply and demand and not once did you see examples of that play out? Seriously? How out of touch with reality are you?

&gt; One is Clopidogrel, anti coagulant released to market in 1999 and was successful. Then in 2001 advertising started for 350million bucks and the drug increased in price costing, Medicare alone over 200 million extra.  

Shocker! “Drug under patent increased in price!” Stop the presses! Funny how all the drugs you listed have seen massive price drops since going generic...

Nothing you did proved that a drugs price went up BECAUSE of advertising. You just cited examples where drug companies decided to rise the price of the drug. In all those examples revenues shot up significantly after the as campaign and no doubt if you accounted for the increase revenue you’d find that it covered the price of the ads. I’d love for you to actually find one example where a company specifically rose the price BECAUSE of ads. I’d love for you to find it because the concept makes no sense. You conduct ads because those ads increase revenue. You are literally making the ludicrous claim that these companies made ads for no reason whatsoever. That they were so stupid that they made ads and realized they were losing profits so increased prices... that there was no return on investment whatsoever from ads... I have never heard such an insane proposition made on Reddit. After being in the industry for 5 years it’s just insane that anyone would make such a ludicrous claim. "

For example, anyone needing an elective THA would likely sign up for insurance on an exchange.

medicine,"I'm gonna copy/paste some of what I wrote on the NYTimes website:

**DIAGNOSIS:**
Temporal/insular epilepsy.

THOUGHT PROCESS:
Everything sounds like primary cardiogenic syncope until you get to the deja vu. Although deja vu is a phenomenon found in normal individuals, the clear and consistent association in time with his asystole makes a stereotyped condition like seizure a strong possibility. While he has many classic features of syncope - diaphoresis, occasional jerking, lightheadedness, the deja vu is a unique feature and really skews the differential.
A few questions remain: why does he have a normal EEG, why do his attacks occur in clusters, and why is this causing his heart to stop?
He could have a normal EEG because of two main reasons. First, a 41 minute EEG is not 100% sensitive even in people with known epilepsy. Second, even if an EEG is hooked up while someone is seizing, the EEG can be normal if the seizure focus is small enough or deep enough in the brain.
The attacks could occur in clusters because some people just have seizures that come in waves, or he could be doing things only periodically that exacerbate epilepsy. For example, he could be drinking alcohol or being very sleep deprived on only an intermittent basis.

Why are these potential seizures causing his heart to stop? There is a phenomenon called ""ictal bradycardia"" which is commonly associated with temporal seizures, likely from disruption of the cortical autonomic network. Note that both his deja vu and ictal bradycardia correspond to the temporal lobe, so our seizure localization makes a lot of sense anatomically.

I would do a THOROUGH history about things like alcohol use or sleep deprivation - really anything that could lead to a reduced seizure threshold which might explain the clustered nature of the events.

**ADVICE:**
Personally, I would be very concerned for the risk of SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy Patients) - a phenomenon where people with epilepsy die in their sleep. It is most commonly seen in patients with uncontrolled generalized tonic clonic seizures, but I would also consider this patient at risk due to the severity of the bradycardia.

I would: 
1) Ideally get a 7 Tesla MRI done (this visualizes tiny cortical malformations better than 3 tesla)

2) Consider being admitted to an epilepsy monitoring unit to try to provoke events in a monitored setting

3) Get hooked up to long-term EEG during a bradycardic cluster

4) Even if nothing shows up on EEG during an event, empirically trial an anti-epileptic drug"

medicine,"This is true. In popular culture, for example, most of the medical drama shows on TV are about nurses. The shows all feature nurses as competent partners in care- not as machines that orders are input to. (Note I said partners, not equals.) Also TV is very realistic about not showing MDs doing all sorts of things nurses usually do, like ambulating pts and head-to-toe daily assessments.

I definitely think that making an extra $3/hour for nights and weekends shows how much recognition and respect nurses deserve as well.

Through popular media and paychecks, society shows nurses how much they think we’re worth. Scrubs with a sassy mouth, not someone who can save lives and is an important and respected part of the care team. Yes, some nurses are broken, incompetent, need-to-retire, too inexperienced, ETC.

medicine,"&gt; The argument is that fewer missed and delayed injuries occur if you pan scan pretty much every code 1 or 2 trauma. MVC, fall &gt; 15 feet, gsw, etc., per that trial.

This is fine, but that is also a small percentage of trauma activations at the average community trauma center.  At my hospital, a level 3 trauma center, I'd wager that maybe 10-20% of trauma activations meet the criteria - and not every MVC is a trauma activation.  We can have the debate that the trauma criteria at my hospital are stupid (and I would agree with that argument, some of them are doozies), but that doesn't change the facts.  So, again, I stand by my previous statement.

&gt; In pregnant women, a missed bowel injury because you tried to do serial abdominal exams instead of just CT-ing the abdomen would be catastrophic, and far more risky than the scan. Better to ex-lap fast and resect the injured bowel before peritonitis sets in.

Okay, but you are still talking about MVC (presumably not every MVC, as a fender bender had better not be a trauma activation at your hospital), large falls, penetrating trauma, and probably some other things like pedestrian struck.  **These are not all trauma activations**.  At my hospital, and every other one I've ever worked at, traumatic loss of consciousness, even if just fall from standing, is a trauma activation.  Do you want to pan-CT all of them without thinking?

&gt; And the reality is that few trauma teams will really take the time to discuss all this with the patient, at least in major trauma.

You're finally getting to my point.  Not all trauma is ""major trauma"".

&gt; and you can't be sure them refusing the scan is not from altered mental status

Wow, that's a hell of an argument.  I'll remember that the next time any patient doesn't want to do what I think should be done.  I'll just say that they're altered.  Should I fabricate physical exam findings to back it up too?

&gt; I have never seen anyone counseled about a CT scan before we do it at either trauma center I have worked at.

HOW DR.AZIZI CURED MY HIV WITH HIS HERBAL MEDICINE

Please pardon me, i just have to share my testimony on how i was CURED OF HIV with the help of Dr.Azizi's Herbal Medicine....Read

Finding out you have HIV can be an incredibly shattering experience. And I think the reason for this is everyone is under the false assumption that the virus is not curable. Well, i totally disagree with this. I was diagnosed of HIV disease for the past 3 years, with the curiousity and search for a cure i came across a blog and i saw lot of testimony post from people making a reference to DOCTOR AZIZI OBAZU how he used his natural herbal medicine to cure them of their diseases Some testimonies was centered on;
*HIV (with a very low cd4 count)
*HEPATITIS B
*HERPES,
*EPILEPSY,
*CANCER,
*DIABETIC,
*STAPHYLOCOCCUS...
I decided to give it a trial, though i never believed in herbal medicine but i was in a way convinced with the sort of amazing testimonies i saw online i decided to contact him, with the response he gave, He promised to prepare and send the ""TATAHWE"" Medicine to me. It was not up to a week after i placed an order, I got the medicine and he instructed me to drink the medicine for two weeks ( only evenings before bed) after which, I should go back to the hospital for a Re-Test. I followed his instructions and i discovered that my urine became yellowish for good two weeks so immediately i finished the medicine i went for the test the following week, it was very surprising i tested negative. I can't thank dr Azizi enough, so I decided to promote him because he cured me from my disease, there's no disease he can't cure with his medicine. Please also spread the good news to others so that those with same illness can be cured.
yours can relate with Dr Azizi on:

medicine,"""How can you stand being inside a ward with 10 mad girls who refuse to eat?"" Said an orthopedic surgeon to me, in front of a group of patients on an eating disorders unit,  when called to see a suicide attempter who had slit her wrists injuring tendons. Interestingly, this surgeon was known throughout our school to have battled anorexia nervosa herself whilst in medical school.

I was stunned and appalled at her insensitivity, especially in front of my patients. I regret not telling her off then."

medicine,"I work in a pediatric hospital with a huge sickle cell population.  It really puts HbSS in perspective when you have 8 year olds who come in writhing in pain.  I often think to myself, “if this were a 35 year old man in some random ED, I bet a lot of people would treat him as a drug seeker.”  It sounds like that’s exactly what happens- the HbSS patient is used to massive doses of opiates; the only other population who requests those doses are heroin addicts."
medicine,"Does anyone ever actually go all the way and measure inulin clearance? "
medicine,"&gt;Quality of life does matter of course, but modern medicine has never been able to provide it. 

This is objectively wrong. Not only can modern medicine cure some diseases, for those that it can't it can still increase quality of life. People with lung or heart diseases can after treatment walk more and get tired less easily. Patients with brain metastases from cancer can have less seizures and remain alive and conscious of their environments for longer. Delaying the progress of degenerative diseases improves the quality of life, as it provides more years that are symptom free, or at least decreases the severity of those symptoms. The whole specialty of palliative care has as a primary goal increasing the quality of life, and the increased life expectancy often is a side benefit. 

&gt;If you look at people with facial burns who get skin grafts, they end up looking worse than when they had the burns

medicine,"30 something female. Paroxysms of VTach and pre syncope with a structurally normal heart. EP study = sustained VTach (iirc there was more than one morphology) and one episode of VFib (during the tests). Arrhythmia team indicated an ICD. She refused.
Fast forward 2 years later, she's on the ER with chest pain, a slight back pain and elevated troponin. The colleague diagnosed her as having a NSTEMI and she ended up on the cath lab.
Her coronary arteries were normal, but the LV had regional wall abnormalities, like an ""inverted"" Tako Tsubo.
That's when I first met her. Tako Tsubo could have been a final diagnosis, but I wanted to make sure we weren't dealing with myocarditis (especially since her troponin was elevated).
Cardiac MRI was normal.
That slight back pain intensified, her BP (which was normal throughout her time at the hospital) went through the roof. We got her a CT scan of the abdomen, which revealed a bleeding on the left adrenal gland near a tumor there.
We ran the tests, metanephrins and all else and she had the tumor removed and sent to pathology. It was a pheochromocytoma, which was probably the cause of her previous arrhythmia paroxysms and her current ""Tako Tsubo-like"" LV abnormality.
After the tumor was removed, she recovered LV function and the arrhythmias stopped."

medicine,"Hmmm anytime there are databases of DNA I am concerned. Yes they are wonderful for research. Also:

-you may discover you have a life changing disease like Huntington’s. The early detection may devastate you but it won’t change the end outcome.

-in discovering you have Huntington’s (or whatever disease) it may cause distress to family members who are now faced with the risk and have to decided if they want to be tested too

-insurance. Yes GINA had been passed. It could also be repealed. Or, a shady insurance company could buy your results and deny coverage based on them without you ever knowing (this assumes that health insurers may be able to deny coverage due to pre existing conditions in the future, a real possibility) 

-interpretation of DNA is only as good as the team that does it. There are a lot of variants that are poorly understood. When 23 and me was on the chopping block by the FDA, there were studies that showed that knowing you were at increased risk for X didn’t actually change health care behaviors 

-finally, my favorite: the police. I am less concerned with specific providers and hospitals sequencing and interpreting DNA, but when large databases are collected via direct to consumer companies or through the police (see the stop and spit phenomenon) I worry a lot. There are cases in the news everyday where someone was wrongfully convicted or almost convicted due to secondary DNA transfer. You could be convicted of murder bc your DNA transferred to the door knob that the murdered person later touched. Juries and cops are too stupid to understand DNA and the caveats associated with it. Having a database makes it infinitely easier to accuse someone of a crime when they were no where near it. This could happen even if just a family member submitted DNA (see golden state killer).

medicine,"A malpractice defense lawyer told me a story about how one of her clients was screwed by their mission statement. The statement said they ""provide excellent care"". The standard of care is not excellent care. They could establish the physician met the standard of care, but not that he provided excellent care. He lost.

In your practice you should be aware of the kind of weight your words carry legally. The strongest positive word I use in my notes is ""seems ok"" or ""management is adequate"". If I'm writing clearance or work notes I write ""at the time of the appointment there is not disqualifying illness or disability."" 

I don't think Trumps physician did anything illegal or wrong necessary, but he was certainly irresponsible and opening himself to liability by putting out a letter like that."

medicine,"Warfarin is a pain in the ass drug. Doses are all over the place, there are significant interactions, and you need patients to be good about getting the blood draws done, especially when you're just starting them on it. The DOAC/NOACs are easier, which also improves patient adherence, but expensive and not clearly as good. One concern is that warfarin is more easily reversed \(vitamin K or FFP\) whereas the novel agents aren't.

If this is a good reversal agent, it's one barrier down for factor Xa inhibitors. That's not the only reason to stick with warfarin, but it is one."
medicine,"When I was an anesthesiology resident, and still learning the skills of timing my anesthetics so that occasionally the patient might wake up in the same decade as the one that the case finished in, I would sometimes ask the surgeon ""are you closing?""

I made the mistake of asking a plastic surgeon that once and he told me, not terribly kindly, ""I'm a plastic surgeon!  All we do is close!!""

He was on the floor with a head lac, and they put him in a wheelchair and left him in the lobby all night? If he was anticoagulated, he definitely should have gone in for a head CT. If not, he should have at least had a few more serial exams, even every 2-3 hours would probably suffice."

In reality, there are pluses and minuses to any career, and we find one of the ones that matches best with who we are. "
medicine,"You are describing cardiogenic shock, unless the bradycardia is profound (like 40 or lower), I would start levophed then dopamine at lowest required doses while working to get them to the cath lab and on mechanical support.

medicine,"Pretty sure the studies mentioned in a didactic we had recently were daily or three times a week administration and duration of effect was usually less than a month.

medicine,"I see you are getting downvoted which makes me think that a lot of people want to work out during job hours. Or they objected to the word ""weird"".  I too found that strong, since this is a personal preference that is, I think fairly commonplace...witness the larger fitness centers many large corporations have in their facilities.  But I will answer your question: For me I may have an hour or two break during my day..between clinics,  a slower day rounding on inpatients, discretionary office time etc.   But, I may have an evening meeting that keeps me at the hospital late. I can get a decent workout  done in that time.  Even on more 9-5 days driving to the club adds an extra 30 min just in travel time/parking so it would be more convenient for me to work out here. Also many people at my work bike to work or take alternate transportation and it would be more convenient for them.  I really don't find that ""weird""."
medicine,"Honestly, being able to recognize someone who is sick. And this applies from the perspective of each allied health professional, not just doctors. "

They do list physician salaries as being higher, but they also say we bear higher costs in education, insurance, retirement, etc. Additionally, they even point out that:

&gt;recent debates on remuneration of medical staff in the United Kingdom and France, for example, suggest that salaries in other countries may be too low

I think it's a good article. It highlights some very important information and gives the US the right info to try and tackle some of the cost issues.

medicine,"But the sunshine, inside the building, inside the metal cart, could have caused the plastic to break down!"
medicine,"I am using it for pain, though it does help mood. I don’t know if the mood lift is because it’s really demoralizing to be in pain and a relief to not be in as much pain or if it’s treating depression. I recently had to stop working and life for disability because of my health and that has been difficult- either way, I appreciate what the Ketamine has done for me. I also take Butrans 10mcg/hr patch and reduced oxycodone from 40mg/day to 10-20mg/day"
medicine,"I fucking hate the term burnout almost as much as I hate the word ""resilience."" These are all just ways for admin to take the world's most gritty, resilient people, who waded through a decade of bullshit to be here and work harder than almost anybody on the planet, and tell us that the reason we're unhappy is that we just don't know how to bend over far enough. We have to be more resilient, or in other words try harder to cup the balls while we're fellating the giant dick of physician disempowerment. It's not that they've taken medicine out of the hands of the people who are actually trained in it and put it in the hands of MBAs and nursing supervisors, it's apparently that we just aren't opening wide enough to swallow all the shit. 

I don't know how they can talk about resilience training with a straight face to a room full of people who tolerate more shit than anybody else would, and I don't know why on earth anyone thinks the solution to this whole mess is to create *more* fucking mandatory lectures and modules on how to be more resilient, full of a bunch of non-science, pop pseudopsych aphorisms and bullshit. "
medicine,"Please, oh please, tell me what they mean by double and who is telling the family that they have double pneumonia. Personally, I would think it might be appropriate if they mean from multiple organisms, in which case I've had patients with triple and quadruple pneumonia. I think they usually mean that it's in both lungs. It would probably be more useful it they were referring to the number of lobes affect. Currently, I just stare at the person saying it and ask them who told them that."
medicine,"I’m in Canada. Our licenses are issued by provincial Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons. "
medicine,"Personally I think there is value to taking additional time in undergrad. But regardless of that, what you are proposing would still be a huge change in how higher education operates. I'm not saying it would be impossible, but from a practical perspective it is harder than just changing a few prerequisites. At the the very least you would get a lot of pushback from colleges who would have students dropping out to apply to med school. Plus it would radically alter how med schools evaluate applicants as opportunities regarding research, clinical work and other non-academic factors would be markedly decreased in this accelerated application timeline. 
"
medicine,You're describing exactly what's wrong with our current EMR...I have a feeling we use the same one
medicine,"I just graduated from an MD/PhD program and am about to enter a 6 year residency, this is too real. Lol. "
medicine,"Sounds like you should check out AMIA, which is the main professional organization with overlapping administrators, computer scientists, and clinicians.

There are lots and lots of people thinking about this, but as long as hospital administrators are choosing EMR's based on billing promises (which almost always fall short), it'll be hard to fix anything."
medicine,"Cool, which city did you work in?

Included and equal in healthcare is in my experience rather important in Sweden. Already in medical school we do things in clinics together with nursing students. And teamwork is always encouraged in clinics. Of course the doctor is always the one responsible for the medical treatments of the patients, but there are so much to learn and have advice on from nurses too! I guess we all wearing the smae clothes is a part of the whole teamwork thing. :)"
medicine,"Could be an insurance issue since annual exams are often covered at no cost to the patient, even for a higher interaction/billing visit.   A regular dr visit may be subject to a deductible, copay, etc.  (a level 5 annual exam may be “free” or low cost, a new patient visit at the same rate could be expensive for the patient)

The doc is the bigger ass here, IMO, since she took the reviews down and they’re still suing for damages.  "
medicine,"I wouldn't actually know what I'm doing. There's such an abundance of different protocols and I'd like to have more of a sense.

Also, I don't have an infusion center handy that will do ketamine infusions for depression. Pain, yes, but not depression.

Even if I did, insurance won't cover it, and I don't have anyone sufficiently depressed and sufficiently wealthy to take advantage of it."
medicine,No worries. It was hard to tell from your comment if you were joking or legitimately inexperienced enough to have not encountered orthopnea
medicine,"ive done 72hrs a week for a year.....the first 1-2 months is rough, but after that you just kind of get in the groove of it and it's not too bad"
medicine,"i have brought up for about the last 10 years in those yearly workplace satisfaction surveys something that  I hear echoed from nearly everyone I work with.  It is a small thing, easy to fix:  provide a small fitness room where we can work out.  Just put in a couple of treadmills/elipticals and a set of dumbells.   We can use the OR showers.  It would cost maybe 10k?  But no,  we cant afford it.  Meanwhile we can hire a new admin, who has a professional degree ( at I am sure 200k or more),  full time to address physician burnout. "
medicine,"My thoughts are that if you have people who actually have an idea what they're doing on the phone then it might help.  However, I can't tell you how many times I see a 4-year-old with a fever and the sniffles because the nurse line that the parents called sent them in ""just in case"" and told them to not give tylenol so that ""the ED sees the fever"".  The idea is sound, the execution needs to be as well."
medicine,"&gt; I think this lawsuit comes across as childish and may backfire in the court of public opinion.

No kidding. It hardly even matters who's right, who wants to see a doctor who sues their patients. "

medicine,"Oh my God, is that what my practice is going to be like 5 years ago in the future when I start my practice? I had no idea, I haven't been doing this every single day of my life. Thank you for enlightening me about my practice, in the future, except I've already been doing it.

I'm sorry people don't understand that the actions people take reflect their priorities. I'm also sorry that people don't understand that pain that isn't a priority to the patient is less severe than pain that is a priority to the patient. I guess I thought that was obvious but live and learn, I guess."

medicine,"When the code was called it was on mother baby and I was the first to respond. Mag was not pushed on a seizing patient until another senior doc showed up. There were two nurses and the crna. 

Honestly I had spent some time thinking that I had been too harsh because clearly nurses do care about their patients and want what's best for them and you seem like you do. It's when we start to demonize one another and make judgement calls about one another that things start to derail. 

But then I read your comment and honestly, it seems like you have your own preconceived notions.I really do appreciate all the work nurses do. The nurses in er portion of our womens hospital really were there for me when depression hit me and ended up checking on me when I left. It really meant the world to me. 

I dunno what makes you think I don't appreciate what your profession does. I do recognize that most of the stuff I have experienced is probably localized to the hospital I've worked at because my friends at other hospitals are horrified when I tell them some stories."

If she didn’t give him the platform he wouldn’t have had the success. Surely someone who she considers a good person and credible source has brought the concerns about him to her attention. She isn’t living under a rock by anyone’s imagination. She herself or someone who works on her behalf has the opportunity and resources to reach out to someone/anyone that could come up with content that could be more helpful to the general public for her daytime television program. Hell, she owns her own network and allows this stuff to air.  

The CDC has already announced that medical propaganda will be one of the biggest things to combat in coming years. At some point we need to hold people who know better but continue to spread this utter bullshit accountable. There are people who haven’t been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to learn or are unable to learn about basic health related things. Oprah had that opportunity and this is how she chose to use the information. With that being said I think it’s fair to give her the side eye on the “good things she does” and wonder how she’s manipulating other “good things” in the name of profit.

medicine,"Good point indeed, but I would like to add that in my experience as a student, the way the doctors word themselves when asking for consent on behalf of students dictates about 90% of the patients decision.

If they say something like ""is it okay if the student does the initial examinations? *You don't have to say yes*/*You are free to say no*"", most patients would decline. If however, they say for instance ""because we are a university hospital, we have medical students here on training from time to time. The student will be performing the examinations under my guidance, and you are free to say stop if it becomes uncomfortable at any point"", it is far more likely that the patient will consent.

Both examples have happened to me recently, and I think it's important that even when asking for specific consent, it is done in a way that lets the patient know the importance of teaching the doctors-to-be how to do their jobs properly. At the end of the day, it affects the patients too to have inexperienced doctors.

medicine,"your two paragraphs differ.  if you mean scrub in without explicit informed concent, then yes, it is wrong.  Teaching hospital or not, you still need concent, as people do not understand what all that entails.  For sure YOU do, but also for sure many people do not.  That means that a blanket policy of ""we teach here so we can do what we want, it is implied"" is not appropriate.  The onus is on you, the person entrusted with care, to acquire actual real informed consent.

medicine,"&gt; Completely lost me there. 

I said we need regulations in place to prevent abuse and then you provided a bunch of studies that showed the problems created by an unregulated system... you never actually responded to what I suggested.

&gt; For one, how is that even possible? Marketing costs money. 30 billion a year only for DTP marketing. Marketing is clearly not cutting into profits. Perhaps you're thinking in bus101 terms that increase in revenues make up for the increase in costs. Everyone points that out for a single company, but revenues for companies are costs to the system. It costs more money. And it's proven. 

Actually it’s not proven. Pharma marketing costs increase patient usage and thus increase pharma revenue. There’s no point to marketing if it’s net effect is negative. It doesn’t even make sense. These companies spend money on marketing because it increases the number of prescriptions which offsets the costs of marketing.

&gt; Again, Professor sir Michael rawlins was head of NICE and noted that some of the cost of drugs is due to marketing. Around 1/4 of the price for some is marketing. 

That’s not how a business works... if I’m selling apples and no one buys them because no one knows I’m selling apples my Revenue will be small. If I then start advertising for the apples my revenue will be quite large. I’ll soon realize that even though I’m spending a lot of money on ads, the revenue I’m making was more than before. Sure technically when you first bought an Apple 0% of the price went to ads and now a certain percent of that goes to ads. But that doesn’t mean the price of apples went up. In fact if I’m a good businessman I would decrease the price of apples since I have now expanded my market share and want my apples to be competitive. The end result is that my ads have allowed me to decrease the price of apples because my revenue went up. It’s the same with drugs and why it makes literally no sense whatsoever to suggest that marketing costs are increasing the price. Supply and demand determines pricing. It makes no sense whatsoever to claim that marketing is what increases the price.

&gt; access to medications is better here.... That's just funny. 

Honestly it’s funny you would suggest otherwise. Access toe medications is PROFOUNDLY better here. It’s not even close. More Americans are on medications than any other country. More prescriptions are written. More blood pressure meds are taken. More statins are taken. More depression is controlled with antidepressants. More diabetics have access to oral diabetes meds. There’s a reason drug companies love the US market and that’s because more Americans are willing to take pills, more pills are prescribed, more doctors will wrote prescriptions. The US makes up 5% of the world population but prescribes 50% of all the world’s medications. That’s what I call access. "
medicine,"T14 wasn't even a term when I went to law school that I'm aware of. These kids keep coming up with more ways to be pretentious all the time. It used to be 1st tier, second, and third tier trash \(classy, I know\). I went to a first tier law school, by far the best in my state, but its not T14. My score on the LSAT and GPA were high enough to go to a T14 but I didn't even apply to one because I had no desire to work for big law and it cost me about a third of what it'd have cost. 

The thing about law school is they don't teach you how to do anything no matter where you go. It's a huge waste of time from an educational standpoint and most new grads have never seen a lawsuit or even know how to file one. We don't even do clinical work. What school you go to is more about connections and pretentiousness. It's the most ridiculous system of education imaginable, just ask any attorney. 

Where you really get tested as an attorney is the real world and it's brutal. There's way too many attorneys so you have to be smarter and more adaptable to thrive. If you plan to be an employee, I'd recommend going to the best school in the state or one of the higher ranked schools. Never go to an unranked or poorly ranked school. They'll take anyone.

medicine,"Not exactly the same in Florida. There are two categories for involuntary examination.

One is for mental health only. You have to have a DSM diagnosis of mental impairment that contributes to inability to make medical decisions for yourself. This category specifically states it does not apply to substance abuse impairment or antisocial behavior.

The second is broken further into two categories: one for an immediate threat of bodily harm to self or others, the other for self-neglect or refusal to care for self which is expected to be unavoidable even with from family or other outpatient services.

The second category does not explicitly disallow substance abuse as a contributing cause. But you have to very clearly establish a link from the abuse to bodily harm or neglect, and the neglect must be specifically suspected to be likely to occur even with outside intervention. That's a hell of a link to establish, especially for a one-time visit. Celebrity or not, you really have to respect the autonomy of patients unless you have absolutely no doubt that they have to be protected from themselves.

This family apparently thinks paternalism is the standard of medicine nowadays. Or, shockingly, maybe they just feel guilty for not making him go to rehab and want the blame to be on doctors instead.

The worst part is that I'm also a patient and as such have an incredibly well developed sense of empathy. But I can't do any patient care with it because to do that requires a minimum of three years of abuse. I can't. "

Other types of valvar disease are still an unanswered question. We do know in the validation trials there were patients with moderate valve disease and even prior interventions (not mechanic valves though) and the subgroup analysis showed no significant difference to other patients on those trials. Furthermore, “valvar” AFib has different definitions throughout the various international guidelines, so that’s still a blurred question.
I know there are studies which will see whether Rivaroxaban can be safely used in AFib patients with bioprosthetic valves. We’ll have to wait, there’s much to know yet about DOACs in Valvar disease!"

medicine,"I've worked as a tech in Adult/Pediatric ER for the past 3 years in a state where we didn't use the Paramedic in the ER (We had medics as tech's, but they weren't allowed to operate at their scope of practice. Just moved to a state where medics are commonly used, and as I understand it from what I've read/nurses I've talked to, the ER's here are using the medics to lighten the load on nurses and are having them do IV starts, triage, etc. 

I could be wrong, or barely scratching the surface of what their full utilization is, as I'm sure they are allowed to do significantly more than that, but on a day-to-day that was my understanding.  "

You have outpatient docs and nurses that haven't run a code since the last time they took the course along with those that work in high acuity emergency departments and ICUs.

It was a great course as a medical student and new intern but now just feels very algorithmic.

I'm an ACLS instructor (but not PALS) and I've definitely had people that were REcertifying who needed remediation on their mega code. Though they technically passed in the end, I really wouldn't expect them to be able to do much more than BLS in a real life situation.

There are some ACLS advanced provider courses but they don't seem to be too popular and I'm not familiar with them.

It would be more reasonable for hospitals to require these courses of those who need the skills and practice but rarely use them.

For those that actively use the skills on a routine basis, these ""merit badges"" should not be required and could be replaced with simulated codes/traumas done periodically in the ED/ICU/OR/etc."

medicine,"Do you ""believe"" in antibiotic therapy for infection?  Or metformin therapy for type II diabetes?  Or thyroid replacement therapy for patients after thyroidectomy?

The data prove that adult patients with opioid use disorder have better outcomes on MAT than without it.  It also shows that such patients have a five-fold increased all-cause death rate in the year after they discontinue MAT.

Your beliefs don't matter as much as the evidence.  Unfortunately, your beliefs are congruent with the majority of the lay population and medical community, so we have an uphill battle in regards to treatment of opioid dependent patients."
medicine,"It's interesting to contrast this with the recent coverage of the child with the neurodegenerative condition, where a significant proportion of the general public seemed to view the ethical option as doing everything possible at whatever cost. Here there is a treatment available but the decision is often made not to offer it because the patient might need it again in the future. 

I saw one of these cases earlier in the year, and to be honest it made me quite uncomfortable to see a surgeon refusing to operate because it was the patient's third round of endocarditis in about 8 years. We don't get to choose not to treat smokers or drinkers, and as far as I know there isn't a quota on the number of times you're allowed to be treated for DKA or an assault. Can anyone help me understand why the rules seem to be different here?

medicine,"This.

If you judge it off of clinical knowledge that I can tell you that my nursing background as made me stand out much more on rotations then the others. 
But to me, what matters most is not the amount of information that you know or your board scores. I have worked as a nurse with MD's from Harvard that no patient wanted to see, no person wanted to work with. 
What matters most is the care you provide to your patients. 
The initials after your name do not determine that. The university that you graduated from does not matter.

So even us software developers feel the pain here. I imagine that with the amount of effort that's been wasted dealing with all of this we could have created some really innovative, lifesaving products that make use of this data. But no, we have to worry about the fact that every single EHR implements the same functionality about thirty different ways, and by the time we finish writing code to deal with that they'll have deviated from those implementations another fifty different ways."

For one, among many to come, it's esomeprazole. Not omeprazole. You've literally gotten backwards the problem I was pointing out. 


For another, you seem to be saying that america has a lot of generic drugs. Why are you doing that? I never said we don't. You're not making the point you think you're making because it is not relevant. Do you even know why we have so many generics? Hatch Waxman. It did wonder things, as you keep truthfully although irrelevantly alluding to. It however is also unfortunatly the problems many problems with legal loopholes being used. You keep implying this ""econ 101"" like a cult. Pharma isn't econ 101. Hatch Waxman fixed many things with the patent system to encourage more generics to be made. 
	• Many patents were ""weak"" and a generic would not want to go through the huge trouble of getting drug to market only for the patent to be easily challenged.
	• It also made it easier to get a generic approved, moving from having to go through the same process as the Brand drug did the first time, safety and efficacy proof, they had to now only prove bioequivalence. 
	• In addition, regular patents do not allow any product to be made while patent was in effect. For drugs, this caused a huge delay, because the patent would come off and then the FDA approval would have to start, Now FDA approval could begin even if patent wasn't up. (Known as paragragh 4 certification) Get Patent battles done, before patent was off, so drug could arrive at market when patent was off. ( Drug won't infringe on patent or that patent is not valid) This gives brand name company notice. It is worked out, all before patent expires. 
	• The first generic to challenge a patent, gets 6 months of exclusivity, with the brand name. A duopoly. After that, all other generics can come in, after showing bioequivalence. (They get around this by paying generics to stay away)
 
It however is also now the source of problems you want to ignore like, again this is all completely irrelevant to my overall point, but you're wrong, for example:

	1) Pay for delay. Effective Bribe. Brand name pays first filing generic not to come into market. Settling Hatch-Waxman. However, 6 month Duopoly period does not start until first generic actually comes to market. So this can be stretched out continuously. Congress has attempted to fix this numerous times by changing wording, but companies just keep getting nimbler with the law.  Price stays higher for a longer period of time, bad for consumers. 
	Supreme court ruled in 2013 that this could be challenged as anti-trust. So companies moved away from the simple versions of this. 
	
	2) Similar to #1, but more complex. Payments are more difficult to detect. But generic still stays off market. Maybe the Brand pays generic to do something economically idiotic, like market the drug. Or to do anything really, where the generic is a useless middleman. Ways which are much harder to detect and enforce as anti-trust. (Like paying a college athlete 10k a month to work part time in an office) Still active.
	
	3) #1 and #2 about collusion. This is about obstruction. Blocking the generics out completely. Evergreening and product hopping; minor modification to delivery or dosing get a new patent and to keep generic from enacting. 
	Asacol; company tried to product hop. Failed. So they stuck a new patent on old capsule, by sticking a new ineffective capsule around it. Literally just took the old capsule, and stuck it inside a new one; you could cut the new capsule and the old one would fall out. But they got a new patent for it. AND, they removed all of the old drug off the market. No more equivalency. 
	
	
	
	 Citizen petition; asking the FDA to not approve a generic. Started in 70s as power to ordinary citizens. Doubled since 2003. Ask the FDA to do things the already do, or are impossible. FDA denies 80% of time, but it still takes time. 1/5 petitions were related to delaying generic from market. 40% were filed with/in year of patent cliff. FDA has 5 months to respond. This could be 100s of millions of sales. 

There's more than this, but I doubt you've made it this far. Why do you ignore these well documented problems I don't know. 

None of this, again, has anything to do at all with my original sourced, and backed by evidence claims, you've merely dismissed with nothing more than an irrationality.

medicine,"Starting a hypotensive patient in cardiogenic shock on an inotrope will drop pressure further, potentially making them worse. The appropiate approach is to give a vasopressor first. Often the higher diastolic pressure will improve coronary perfusion and contractility in and of itself. Norepinephrine also does have a bit of b1 activity, so it gives you both. Once the pressure is adequate, if there is still poor cardiac output then you can start an inotrope like dobutamine or milrinone. Another option is to just use a straight epinephrine drip."

medicine,"[Na(infused) - Na(serum)] / (TBW+1)

That will give you the theoretical change of Na will 1L of fluid. This does not take into account insensible water loss/water intake/change in water excretion due to ADH variation. It is just a guide. You must check Na frequently.

Ex. Patient with acute on chronic hyponatremia now with Na 129 --&gt; 117 in 36 hours (definition of acute is &lt;48 hours) and altered mental status. Needs 3%. Weights 70kg.

(513-117) / (42+1) = 9.2meq/L. 

So after 1L of 3%, Na should theoretically be 126. 1000/24 = 41.6ml/hr. So run at 40cc/hr and check BMP q4 hours and adjust due to calculation limitations above.

Another school of thought is to bolus 100cc 3% up to 3 times until symptoms resolve, then reassess.

Just yesterday I did a combination of the two. Bolused 100cc then 40cc/hr. 117--&gt;122 in 24 hours. This is a guy with SIADH though so I did not expect a quick correction. 

Regarding your ODS patient - hypovolemic hyponatremia is tricky. I would not repeatedly bolus ""isotonic fluid."" It is not isotonic in someone with hyponatremia - you are bolusing hypertonic fluid relative to the patient. If they have no neuro symptoms it means the hyponatremia is chronic and they are at higher risk of ODS. It's crucial to remember the definition of tonicity. "

Of course his personal beliefs mean absolutely nothing, since the fact that he has a gunshot wound to his legs is undeniable. He was shot by the IDF for just standing around in the wrong side of the fence. 

I’m Jewish, one of my sons was born in Jerusalem, my husband speaks fluent Hebrew and reads both Israeli and US/international press. I have no idea why you are so invested in discrediting this man who has done absolutely nothing to hurt anybody, has made no attempt to demonize or discredit anybody, and whose apparent fault here is that he got shot. 

Also you’re just being a jerk wrt to the nurse above. Of course she knows her colleague 100x better than you and is in a much better position to judge his values than you are. "
medicine,"It's particularly hard when someone is in the hospital. Getting out of the acutely ill phase and then through the immediate recovery phase is an important breakpoint. We see those who are seriously ill take immediate turns for the worse beyond what we may be expecting. 

Those numbers sound like what could be possible for someone who recovers from what landed them in the hospital. At the time she was seen, it was possible that she could have lived a long time, but there was also a strong possibility that she wouldn't. This is what happens when you take an average survival (mean average of (3 days + 180 days) is 3 months)  and say I think she'll make it to 3 months (or choose whatever numbers apply to your situation). An average does not include the uncertainty of that guess, and asking the doctor to give you that uncertain number that the doctor has no confidence in will confuse everyone, as it has in your case.  And still, our movies, media, and journalism all communicate to us that we should ask what survival a person may have even when that number more often than not means very little or nothing.


When the doctor ""gave him/her 5 months to live and they died that week"" or ""lived 20 more years"" it's not because the doctor didn't know that was possible, but because on average that's what happens to a person in a similar situation. We can try to protect ourselves and say I don't know for sure, no one can tell the future, or refuse to answer, but no one of satisfied with that. But then again, few are satisfied with the average guess either so we're all SOL anyhow."

They might have an idea of what the reimbursement will be for a various CPT, but they don't know what your OOP max is, or how much you've already paid this year, or even what your coinsurance might be. There are thousands of plans, all with different rules, how is your hospital supposed to keep up with all that?

We had to rebuild our changing rooms to accommodate everyone (still don't) at quite a large cost, as was the cost to acquire and provide scrubs daily for thousands of people in different sizes, and burning the old scrubs that overnight were made obsolete. 

It isn't a perfectly reasonable precaution to spend millions of euros per hospital per year because someone thinks something may be dangerous when all studies done have failed to show any improvement over standard practice. 

Even the British ones, where BBE was implemented at the same time as actually washing your hands aren't that clear. 

It has also been decided we need one-use stethoscopes, one-use flashlights, one-use pens, one use gloves and one-use everything else to limit the spread of bacteria. I'd love to see any study showing benefit from that in anything but a select patient group.

And I used scrubs even before I had to (we didn't have to until 2 years ago). I like using scrubs. I like having short-sleeved t-shirts (I'm not inbred, I will not wear a short-sleeved shirt). I almost never wear a coat anyway, so that didn't really affect me."

She was raising money for a diagnosis she didn’t have....but my hands were tied because of HIPPA. My colleagues and I who had taken turns caring for her were furious. We talked to our ethics chair and basically if we said anything to anyone about what she was doing - no matter how unethical it was - we would be breaking patient confidentiality.

I followed up on her page like a month later and found out that she was having a fundraiser event a few blocks from where I lived. I decided to stroll by just to see what type of damage she was doing....and there were only 3 people there. Either people didn’t believe her bullshit or didn’t like her.

medicine,"&gt; 1. But i believe it is impossible to state with absolute certainty what the child's best interests are in this scenario. To do so would require one to be absolutely certain that death is better than life.

If it is uncertain but highly probable that in this child's case, early death is better than prolonged suffering, you go with highly probable. Not parental preference. 

&gt; Yes, if the court is certain as to what the child's best interest is.

There is no such thing as certainty. Doctors should know that there is always a margin or error. This does not excuse us from throwing our hands up and saying ""Well, I guess anything is possible, have at it with the treatments.""

&gt;This is what we do every day to kids with Downs syndrome and kids with cerebral palsy, to say nothing of numerous other disorders. 

This is not what we do everyday to kids with these disorders, and you know it.

&gt;They are made to undergo painful, life prolonging procedures to treat spasticity, heart defects, etc.

No one forces them to undergo these procedures. The difference is that if you were to ask these children ""Hey, do you want to die?"" they would say no and you can use judgement to understand that they want these procedures. They are able to communicate their preferences and make logical decisions. Someone with cerebral palsy with appropriate understanding of their condition can refuse care. 

Either way what we do with kids with Down Syndrome and Cerebral palsy is FOR THEIR BEST INTEREST. NOT FOR THE PARENTS. Which is the main point of this entire debate.


Let me ask you another question. Should courts not take children away from their mother if their mother beats them daily? This is the same scenario of ""Suffering vs extra time with parents."" 

Answer me honestly and objectively. How is transport and trach/PEG for Alfie in his best interest? Because death might be worst then suffering? 

In that case nobody should ever be taken off life support and nobody should ever be allowed to die. Parents should be allowed to barricade their children in their rooms with only food and water so that they may not go outside and accidentally kill themselves.

medicine,"The [FTC was not happy with Malinckrodt's monopoly](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/mallinckrodt-wraps-up-questcor-ftc-probe-100m-payment-licensing-agreement):

&gt; “Questcor [owned by Malinckrodt] took advantage of its monopoly to repeatedly raise the price of Acthar, from $40 per vial in 2001 to more than $34,000 per vial today—an 85,000 percent increase,” said FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in a statement. “We charge that, to maintain its monopoly pricing, it acquired the rights to its greatest competitive threat, a synthetic version of Acthar, to forestall future competition.”

They had to license Synacthen to Marathon:

&gt; Now, in addition to paying $100 million to the federal government and five states, Mallinckrodt will license Synacthen to Marathon Pharmaceuticals, for development as a treatment for infantile spasms and nephrotic syndrome, two of Acthar’s FDA-approved uses. The company retains the rights to Synacthen for other indications, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is its current focus.


Here's the [stock trader perspective](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4070075-ahead-earnings-competitor-mallinckrodts-acthar-emerging):

&gt; MNK has found success with Acthar because it has taken the alternatives out of commission. It entered into a settlement agreement with the FTC a few months ago because it **had been hoarding Synacthen Depot**, a widely available synthetic that is not approved here in the US but is approved and used in Europe. Nobody had been advancing the development of the synthetic because MNK bought and secured the rights to it years ago. Even now, after the FTC has found that the company had essentially had a monopoly and had needed to divest of Synacthen, MNK is still in pretty good shape. They had to license Synacthen to Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which has done little with it thus far and will likely do little with it in the future.

That anti-monopoly action took place during the previous administration."

Military medicine is super different. According to them, soldiers don't do anything without orders - so when they visit, they are ordered to do so by a noncom, and a doctor's orders count as military orders so non compliance = insubordination. Everyone who enters the general's clinic snap to attention and salute him before being told to be at ease and to sit down before he asks them,

""So what the **** is your problem, soldier?""

At the time I was taught to be nice and cordial to all patients so hearing him swear in his first sentence was pretty weird, but none of the soldiers showed any sign that this was weird. I put it down to military culture.

However this is what stuck with me. A private entered saying he's got a tiny lump on his abdomen. Examination and ultrasound showed it was a simple lipoma. Tiny thing, about an inch in diameter. Didn't hinder him in any way, just that his noncom wanted it checked out just in case. He was obviously relieved when the general said it's nothing serious, but then he asked what the general was going to do about it.

medicine,"I’m a US IMG (non Carib) in my last year of med school, hoping to apply to the current match cycle coming up in September.

Easily, so having a specialty with a sense of variety in what they see would be a huuuge plus as well. This lead me to consider Rads, and IM (with the intention of becoming a hospitalist maybe) Here are my concerns-


Rads- more difficult to get into, pretty long training time esp if I go for fellowships- which I hear is becoming mandatory to get a job in rads (is this true...?)


IM: the culture of IM where I go to uni vs the US is quite different, I imagine. I have an elective lined up late summer so I guess I’ll see for sure, but I here it’s socially quite taxing and more intense than rads. On the plus side, I could potentially have a job lined up after 3 years (or go for a fellowship, if I decide).

medicine,"Are you talking about AMA for drug abuse related matters where the only medical issues and diagnoses were directly related to drug use, or other types of self-discharge AMA scenarios?

This is interesting. From the provider perspective, the patients are often not hearing anything that is being told to them. The hospital has a form that they require the pt to sign or that we document pt refused to sign, that includes what you discussed above e.g. informed refusal, risks, capacity (doctors do not determine competence; it is court determined; incompetent patients are probably already under a locked ward)). If the doctor signs this form with the pt, or the patient refuses to hear this or sign before leaving, in what way is the doctor or hospital liable for the patient leaving and whatever the incurred harms are. Is the doctor supposed to tackle the patient, call stat security for a patient leaving, until they decide  they want to sign or hear the discussion, or for a capacity evaluation form psychiatry?

Fearing concentration of capital in multiple private hands (even if just a very few), more than concentration of capital in the hands of a central government, is not rational.  Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Governments which control most of the capital in their country are the closest real-world example of absolute power combined with absolute corruption.  The creeping phenomenon in the US of the federal government controlling capital which is in ""private"" hands is insidious, as it disguises the proportion of capital which is being controlled by government for the benefit of those in positions of government power.  Go to a ""private"" university? Federal laws and regulations control most of what goes on there.  Go to a ""private""hospital for medical care?  Ditto."

But now I see that you were actually supporting my point, you think medical doctors *should* have surgery covered by their license, so we're on the same page.

And, to answer your question, I'd say the same thing that makes you qualified to do appis for a living - you have to prescribe these drugs often and see the complications of these drugs and how to address those complications. The same way that your residency taught you how to deal with perforated bowels from appendectomy, mine taught me how to try to reverse an intracranial bleed from AC... and when you haven't done this dozens of times, often at 2 AM, you don't have respect for what the procedure/medication entails.

400-900 (as the case may be) is a bit of a gray area, but I would wager the vast majority of people would rather have a migraine. 

I do see this drug as providing value, but the price is so absurdly high I don’t think it is priced accordingly.

Some cities have started to try and pass laws saying three strikes and they won’t save you. I’m saying that that particular situation is wrong. And that it’s not up to us to determine how many chances an addict is allowed to get. "

medicine,"So I'm really frustrated. I have a computer science degree in Neuroinformatics. I want to do all this crazy computer science in medicine, improving the awful EMR, providing tools that might actually help on the wards. But we rotate every 4 months, and so any projects I do get involved with end up being minor audit pieces instead of something lasting.

 I've gone to the hospital management and said 'hey I'm a dual-trained medic/computer scientist lets do some fun patient fixing stuff' and been met with a brick wall. 

So instead I'm gonna be off doing primary research, moving my data skills away from the bedside, which I regret, but there is much more appetite for this in academia than clinical medicine!"
medicine,"Interesting, cheers!"
medicine,I can't find any figures but it's a [perennial topic for pearl-clutching](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2532461/Why-having-women-doctors-hurting-NHS-A-provovcative-powerful-argument-leading-surgeon.html).
medicine,"Damn does this hit home.

&gt;Then the owners announce that to get paid for her work, this chef must document everything she cooks in an electronic record. The requirement sounds reasonable at first but proves to be a hassle of bewildering proportions. She can practically make eggs Benedict in her sleep, but enter “egg” into the computer system? Good luck. There are separate entries for white and brown eggs; egg whites, yolks, or both; cage-free and non-cage-free; small, medium, large, and jumbo. To log every ingredient, she ends up spending more time documenting her preparation than actually preparing the dish. And all the while, the owners are pressuring her to produce more and produce faster.

&gt;It wouldn’t be surprising if, at some point, the chef decided to quit. Or maybe she doesn’t quit—after all, she spent all those years in training—but her declining morale inevitably affects the quality of her work.

I'm not a doctor, but I have an analogous job in that I do diagnostic IT and projects, which could be compared to surgeries or long treatment plans.

My last company got super hardcore in to the culture quoted above, and it's exactly why I left."
medicine,"The short answer is that's pretty much it. Thankfully, for the most part we have total control on treatment planning and diagnosis.

The long answer's mostly given by [this](http://www.oralhealthworkforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/wheel-desktop-2.jpg). Some states like Minnesota have created an NP-esque role called a ""dental therapist,"" where they can do some minor fillings and other procedures with a couple more years of school.

Just like in y'all's case, they skip the classes and Boards part. At least the USMLE/NBDE+ parts."
medicine,"At some laboratories the policy is to repeat critical values. Also, if the result is too high to be read by our analyzers,  we get a result like ""&gt; value"". We then have to dilute the sample and repeat it to get an actual value."
medicine,"The problem with that is medicine is wholly unfamiliar with perioperative issues/complications and that probably doesn't need to be added to medicines already enormous curriculum.

Edit: Alternatively, the surgical service could pay the medicine service for babysitting their patients."

medicine,"I have never and would never recommend mashing a hematoma. If you have a pseudo, hold pressure or inject it. If you have a hematoma, let it resolve unless there are indications for surgery.

"
medicine,"Don't push everything onto your techs or less experienced nurses. Treat your ancillary staff the same way you would treat a fellow nurse (everyone from housekeepers to radiology techs). Lead from the front and never ask anyone to do something if your hands are empty. Try to be the first one in and the last one out of any room. Don't let all of your critical patients get handed to the most experienced nurse(s) - they get burned out too, so let a newer nurse take the reigns (and the load) and coach them when needed. Treat EMS well and capitalize on mistakes made in the field by turning them into a learning experience for your team AND the EMS crews. 

I could go on, but I'd be rambling. It all boils down to the golden rule of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. "
medicine,"So, I'm not into gyn at all, but we recently had a talk from a gynaecologist who was actually quite upset the things were dissappearing from the market since he still really liked them.

Anyone in the field who feels the same way?"
medicine,"It sounds like most of the research has been using single doses to provide relief for a prolonged period after. With that model, it makes more sense to give doses at infusion centers or clinics than to send someone home with a bag of ketamine. "
medicine,Everyone's talking about EMRs but won't our jobs be at risk if AI took it? We'll be reduced to clerks and would need to tend more to the machines rather than the patients? I am paranoid
medicine,"I’ve actually never read that particular book but because of your comment I ended up buying it. Looking forward to that section!

Over the past couple years I’ve been reading Clinical Physiology of Acid-Base and Electrolyte Disorders by Burton Rose. More limited in scope than the Guyton book but it does an excellent job of explaining fundamental concepts. "
medicine,"Ours is very similar, and it's at a top tier US academic center. It completely baffles me. 

What's even more annoying is that the docs at the executive health center order every imaging study stat.

Charging people and companies for these services is exploitive and violates the core of medical ethics. "
medicine,"The pain scale seems to be exponential. "
medicine,"5 minutes for 6-8 patients adds up pretty quickly "
medicine,"I am at the end of my residency now, but this attitude towards me when I was a student made me hate my colleagues once I became a resident. I resented every doctor and every resident older than me, and also older nurses. I was suspicious of anyone in the staff being nice to me. 
I still have problems integrating teams at work because of the borderline bullying by people whom I was supposed to look up to. I have zero social problems outside of the hospital, and today I still find it easier to communicate with patients than with hospital staff.
I had problems because I was verbally abusive to the staff at the beginning of my residency. I realized I was doing the same shit as the morons I hated when I was a student. 
I am still in a rough place but it's getting better. I'm thinking of leaving the field still, and I think I will forbid my kids from studying medicine if they ever want to. Well, maybe not forbid but strongly discourage them

medicine,"Salt is 40% sodium by weight. An intake of 3400mg sodium per day translates to 8.5 grams of salt. Studies like the [INTERSALT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3664342/) study have shown that in The US and Europe, median salt intake varies notably between different countries and populations. However, while no median intakes &lt;8.5 gram were reported in any cohort, many populations reported median intakes well over 12 grams.  "
medicine,"That only happens for me when I'm working with VA attendings. "

medicine,"I’ve got pretty thick skin. I can let a lot roll off my back and hold my own in most situations (and you better watch out if I catch you screaming at a scared new nurse/med student/resident etc). It’s not the one patient here or there that is dealing with their fear/frustrations in that manner. It’s the day in, day out entitlement and lack of appreciation (or even just simple manners) that gets to me at times. I also feel like too many grown people lack coping skills or feel any sort of responsibility for themselves and it makes me more sad than anything else. I went from pediatrics to emergency and one of my favorite sayings is, “I can handle a 4 year old acting like a four year old, but a 50 year old acting like a four year old is just fucking ridiculous.”"
medicine,"It's fairly short-sighted to expect everyone to work in a hospital or large healthcare system, though, or only design systems that work well in those environments. Some would argue that the decline of smaller practices is one of the worst aspects of the current medical world. "

medicine,"The system I work for isn’t unionized. About two years ago a class action suit was settled against the system and a payout was issued to the floor nurses. The payout was for missed lunch breaks, or being forced to take a lunch break with your phone. I worked telemetry for two years missing lunch for about 3/4 of my shifts and I received a check for $36. Also, I rarely draw blood these days, usually our awesome phlebotomists come by to do that, but I’m capable of doing more than one a shift so I’m not sure where that information came from.

You sound like a relatively new physician, so here’s my unsolicited advice: don’t have such a chip on your shoulder. Don’t treat nurses like a “nice side benefit” and act like our job is cushy and meaningless while you do all the real work. We are partners. Again, not equals, but partners. I’m just an RN pleb but most of my docs treat me very well. They trust me, I respect them, we do good work together. You don’t build an empire by playing with all the blocks in a corner by yourself.

One thing I wish people would understand.  Unless you are a celebrity or somebody otherwise famous, nobody wants your medical information.  Seriously.  Nobody gives a shit about your hypertension, or even the STD you had 10 years ago.  The hackers can't make money on it.  Stuff like your SSN, address, and credit cards (which are all over the place and have been leaked on a nearly monthly basis) they can make money on, but not your medical information.

medicine,"To begin with, online rating-reviews are a deeply flawed system and barely work for anything and are definitely not equipped to deal with anything healthcare related. The only real reason to use these services is to see what's open close by and reasonably priced since you'll always get very skewed reviews unless you have an elaborate vetting system in place.

The doctor is ridiculous if he thinks he'll be getting all that compensation but aside from that I would say his position is the more justifiable one. Giving someone the lowest rating possible because of a payment disagreement and not any problem with the actual service or outcome is like saying a fancy restaurant was awful because you had to pay a lot. The defendant's aim was clearly to defame the plaintiff over what should have been settled privately and not at all directed toward helping others make appropriate healthcare choices."

medicine,"I'm going to do my best to steelman the DoD here. In my humble opinion, it's not really given a fair shake. It's beyond wasteful and horribly flawed in many ways, but I still think we get our money's worth out of it.


&gt;What makes more sense is to either discuss what percentage of the **budget** is defense spending or to compare the total defense spending with those of other countries.

There's a few reasons why I personally believe % of GDP is a better fit. Exchange rates, for one. The American dollar has much less real-world purchasing power in America than in Russia. A million pays for ten servicemen in the US, but 20-30 Russians. 

It's a misleading figure to say that Russia spends X dollars - they do spend x, but they get much more for their dollars.

&gt;In case you're wondering, defense spending is 20.1% of the total budget.  That's insane.  As for comparing total defense spending, we spend, depending upon the sources for spending, about (probably slightly less than) three times more on defense than our closest rival: China.

How big is the American government budget compared to other governments? Given how low are taxes are compared to Europe, I reckon our budget is proportionally smaller.

There's another thing with Europe: We're paying their bills. Less than half of Germany's tanks work. France and Britain ran out of missiles when fighting *Libya*. We get a great deal of goodwill out of our budget (on paper). There really isn't much else other than the US keeping Russia from taking Ukraine and Belarus.

And that's not all the DoD does. It's active in almost every country in the world.

Speaking of China, America once spent less than Britain, but our splendid isolation didn't last forever. China is a fiercely nationalistic country (much more so than America) and theirs won't last forever either.

We don't really need all of what we have now. The power balance is ridiculous. But, that's kind of the point. There's nothing more dangerous than two peers who both think they *might* be able to take the other.

In addition, doctors are at the hospital 24/7 not because they're needed at that exact moment. You keep them there because you might need them later. A competent military takes *far* longer to produce than a doctor - once you shut down military funding, the insitutional damage/loss of expertise can be crippling and take decades to restore. We made this mistake in Korea and almost lost the ROK because of it.

medicine,"Right! So, saturated fat is linked to raising LDL. While the link to mortality is not 100% there, we have to consider what the foods are that we're consuming that are high in saturated fats, and what those foods might be replacing. When counseling patients, it seems to be more impactful to tell someone to reduce their saturated fat intake because ""it's bad for CV health"" or some similar reason, rather than try to explain what I've written below.

So, beef &amp; processed meats are probably the first foods that come to mind when people think saturated fat. Red meats and processed meats are linked to an increase in CVD given the ability of gut bacteria to synthesize TMAO. They're also linked to colon cancer. Additionally, red meats and processed meats are more calorically dense and fatty compared to leaner meats/fish. The majority of my patient population (in the US) could certainly benefit from making alternative choices to red meat/processed meats whether or not the reduction in LDL is actually proven to reduce mortality.

Now if I could get my patients to focusing on reducing their LDL cholesterol (by reducing saturated fat), that would ideally mean they're eating more fruits and vegetables, more fiber, more whole grains, more fish, and more unsaturated fats, particularly higher in omega 3s. A girl can dream lol"

medicine,"Having seen the process first hand of getting a patient into an expanded access protocol, I have to say it is very tedious and time consuming.

But that is something different altogether... 

This bill seems like it would make it possible to bypass that system entirely to get a drug to use for anything, as long as it has passed phase 1... Surely, the drug company will collect data, but I personally don't like the lack of FDA oversight. Maybe it would help if drug companies could widen their criteria for expanded access and make the process easier and more transparent for prescribers, and if the FDA would relax and streamline their reporting processes as well?"

medicine,"There's unfortunately a pretty substantial history of stigmatization and misinformation surronding sickle cell. [This article](http://www.societyandmedicine.columbia.edu/genetics_curric_sct4_case.shtml) provides some context with citations about the history of the cultural stigma.  In the middle of the 20th century, for instance, arguments about the ""dysgenic effects of race-mixing"" were made using HbSS as an example.  Little distinction was made between those with trait and with disease, as well, despite the almost total harmlessness of carrier status. The article mentions that:

""[s]ome carriers were charged higher insurance premiums or denied health insurance and life insurance.  Others were refused jobs or fired as result of their carrier status, on the assumption that carrier status reduced a person’s ability to fulfill job requirements. For example, the U.S. Air Force at times refused to accept carriers into the service and at other times, restricted the duties assigned to them...""

As a result, a climate of mistrust slowly came to reign.  When screening programs were launched in the 1970's, many African Americans refused to participate out of fear that a registry could lead to HbSS genocide.  Things got so bad in certain places that ""[i]n order to obtain a New York state marriage license, all persons “not of the Caucasian, Indian, or Oriental races” had to undergo testing for sickle cell.""

It took decades for those wounds to begin to heal, but concerns for bias persist today.  30% of the HbSS community  feel they have been discriminated against by their physicians in the past.  The law now in place probably has its roots in that sense of mistrust."

We’re all reasonable alternatives discussed? There have been many many successful malpractice cases based on AMA where the doc insufficiently documented the interaction, perhaps thinking the “AMA” would protect them. 

If you have a patient leaving AMA you need to understand that this is very high risk and document very very defensively. Source: am on board of a mad mal insurer. "
medicine,"There was very little chance he was being screened for pancreatic cancer. Even for high risk populations, we don't know what the best thing to do is for early detection. Medical writing of the lay population and press is consistently inaccurate; this cancer was not being looked for and was just incidentally found during some other reason for a doctor's visit. They called this visit a ""routine screening"" probably to avoid detailing his other medical history. Maybe he just turned yellow from an obstructing lesion and he got surgery. You know, the routine kind of jaundice. Or routine 20 lb weight loss, fatigue, or migratory thrombophlebitis leading to workup.

There are a number of scenarios mentioned elsewhere in this thread.

medicine,"Late to this party but a few thoughts..

1. I would get an ABG. Pain causes respiratory alkalosis, so we need to know what component of the metabolic acidosis is a compensation.

2. What was the patient's serum Albumin? The correction for the Anion Gap is +2.5 for every 1g/dL drop in Albumin. In some cases, correction for hypoalbuminemia negates the NAGMA, and you are left with only a pure AGMA. Side note: We always use 12 as a ""normal"" AG, but you can calculate a normal AG on a patient-by-patient basis by using (2.5xAlb)+(0.5xPhos). The reason we use 12 is because normal Albumin and Phos level is ~4.

3. Do we have a baseline serum creatinine? While 1.0 may appear normal, if her baseline is 0.5mg/dL then she has a significant AKI from decreased PO intake. This would also explain a disproportionally high Anion Gap in relation to b-hydroxybutyrate levels (correlation is ~0.75, so a level of 6 should increase your AG by ~5, whereas in this case we have an increase of 10). 
Her BUN/Cr ratio is &lt;20:1 despite a very high urine specific gravity due to decreased protein intake.

4. SGLT2's inhibit sodium-glucose co-transport in the proximal tubule. Even if you calculate a urine anion gap (Na+K-Cl) in a patient without acidosis, the urine gap will be positive due to excess sodium loss. I would basically ignore the positive urine gap in this patient. SGLT2's do not cause proximal RTA. The only risk factor she has for an RTA is DM2, which can cause a Type 4. 

4. The Anion Gap at OSH was 22 with bicarb 17, and 22 again at your hospital with bicarb 12. The NAGMA is due to the NS she got at the OSH. 

AGMA due to starvation ketosis +/- AKI.
NAGMA due to NS.
Respiratory alkalosis secondary to pain?

Very nice case with lots of potential confounders.

medicine,"I’m an uneducated schlub, but as a former cancer patient I read everything there was to read on this particular topic. If you’re looking for PhD’s, Thomas Seyfried at Boston College is a notable advocate of metabolic therapies as is Dominic D’Agostino of USF. Based on my observations, it’s a growing field with new articles/information being published all the time. 

That being said, I don’t think anyone reputable is advocating these philosophies or therapies as a catch all for cancer treatment. They usually argue or postulate that through fasting or adhering to a strict ketogenic diet one could potentially slow cancer growth and/or extend the life of a cancer patient when used in conjunction with traditional therapies.

And then comes the negative press. I impress upon my pts the importance of using intranasal ketamine responsibly, in the right setting.

medicine,"Problematic field as opposed to what? The field of feminism? At least one attempts to validate itself in biological studies - the other just postulates the world on assumptions that have never been shown to be true. It's rather hilarious that a doctor is telling me it's problematic to use one of the pillars of our field - evolution - in the understanding of how the human brain works and how society was derived from it. 

Where do you get your notions of equality and gender roles from? If its from feminism I can see how you're struggling with the concept - Marxist ideology is insidious. You seem to think taking raw outputs like how many women and men are in the fortune 500 is somehow a measure of equality - ignoring completely that men and women are separate categories with quantifiable differences - something well accepted in all fields of psychology and validated through thousands of studies in the field of personality psychology. Should we call it inequality because men die younger? Because men are the majority of workplace deaths? Should we start attempting to shape young girls to become miners so we can break even on those numbers?

If I took the way you measure equality and applied it to medical sciences we'd never arrived at any useful conclusions. It would be like taking patients on one chemotherapeutic agent and comparing them to another group without ever even addressing each groups baseline characteristics. Try taking the same critical thinking you apply in medicine and using it here too, because you clearly haven't done so. "
medicine,"Well it depends heavily on the state in the US, since licensing is done at the state level.

Some states are pretty strict with docs prescribing bogus prescriptions and will catch them shortly. However some *really* give all the leniency and latitude to the physician.

medicine,"They overstated the benefits on glycaemic control in the abstract. From the results section:

&gt;Although both wines tended to improve some glucose metabolism components after 2 years, only white wine significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose level by 1.0 mmol/L (−17.2 mg/dL) (CI, −1.60 to −0.3 mmol/L [−28.9 to −5.5 mg/dL]; P = 0.004) and HOMA-IR score by 1.2 (CI, −2.1 to −0.2; P = 0.019) compared with the water group 

Not sure if you're a clinician. 1mmol/L is not clinically significant, even if it is statistically. 

For the genotypes:

&gt;These carriers had favorable significant changes compared with carriers of ADH1B*2 homozygotes; FPG level was −0.21 mmol/L (−3.8 mg/dL) versus 0.82 mmol/L (14.8 mg/dL; P = 0.043), HOMA-IR score was −1.4 versus 0.3 (P = 0.012), and HbA1c level was 0.1% versus 0.6% (P = 0.024).

So those numbers are more interesting, particularly the HbA1c, but even so- in diabetes, the target is &lt;6-6.5%, so a difference of 0.5% isn't huge for actual clinical benefit. Particularly since HbA1c isn't the outcome the patient cares about- a 0.5% difference in your HbA1c over 10 years is going to have a small impact on the important outcomes of disease complication.

Even more importantly, those are all in people with abnormal glucose homeostasis, so I'd be slow to generalise the findings to healthy folk.

I'm not saying moderate alcohol intake is harmful or to be preached against- I just don't think the bimodial distribution is convincing evidence that it's beneficial. That's fine; I have plenty of lifestyle habits that aren't actively beneficial to my physical health. I'm just talking about the science behind it.

Edit: Again, my point wasn't that there weren't statistically significant changes in the BP study, but that I am suspicious of P mining, and that there is an important distinction between statistically significant versus clinically significant. If blue striped barracuda were *statistically* likely to bite off 1% less of your hand than red striped barracuda, you probably still couldn't tell which one bit you during your recovery from the attack."

medicine,"Okay full genome sequencing, even if it were cost effective (which it isn't), is a **terrible idea.** It's like performing a full-body imaging workup on healthy patients. You are going to get benign, incidental findings on practically every patient. 

I also take issue with the article stating ""a genetic diagnosis of Autism cannot be made"" in the Fragile-X workup recommendations. **Horses$!t.** ""Non-regressing autism"" has been a catchall diagnosis for intellectual disabilities for decades. I can name you a dozen genes that have been implicated in *monogenic* intellectual disability in the last five years. Each of these disorders have unique prognoses, needs, and responsiveness to treatment. Refer these patients to Medical Genetics.

The sequencing of oncogenes and other ""predisposition"" polymorphisms should be elective (never standard of practice) and only after a long conversation with Genetic Counseling. No layperson is prepared to interpret BRCA1 locus sequencing results. Then, if they *do* decide they want to do something prophylactically (e.g. mastectomy), that conversation is had with the respective specialist (e.g. surgery). I don't see a role for the GP in that scenario except in referral.

tl;dr Genetics will be transformative in medicine in the 21st century. But no GP (or any doctor) should be expected to learn all 30,000+ genes. Rather, specialists will learn the genes specific to their practice. GPs should make referrals to the appropriate specialist for specialized concerns--including concerns for genetic disease."

medicine,"I had a very hard time early in medical school and I gradually developed some personal rules to stay sane. I'm still early in my training (PGY-2), but doing this stuff has allowed me to remain pretty happy throughout the process:

1- don't be a martyr. I try to go home right at the end of the day. I know I could be a slightly better doctor if I stayed longer, but frankly it's not worth it to me. I think we'd all agree that we'd be even better still if we all worked 18-hour days, but we don't do it, because we understand that there are diminishing returns to any process. No one is going to give me a special award for suffering the hardest. Not my patients, and not the hospital administration. I will get to bear the full negative impact of my overwork (get fat, get depressed, have horrible relationships, no leisure time, etc.) and relatively little of the reward.

2 - Exercise, the more the better. The benefit is non-linear. Going from zero to ten minutes a day is a lot more helpful than going from sixty to seventy minutes, so it doesn't take all that much effort to realize the bulk of the benefit. Bonus if your exercise is also a hobby you're passionate about.

3 - Sleep 7 or 8 hours. Even if I think I'm doing fine on less, I'm not. Beyond the cognitive, metabolic, and athletic derangements, my wife tells me I start to get moody and irritable. I will sacrifice a lot of other things to make sure I get enough sleep.

4 - Omit time-wasting commitments. I try to avoid all the time-sucking extra stuff in residency unless there's a clear value to either my career goals or to advancing the residency program itself, which I love. I.e. no joining random committees, no writing articles that will be read by 3 people and which really add nothing useful to the practice of medicine. I already spend a lot of time on patient care and academic stuff, so any extra projects need to be heavily scrutinized. I realize my CV will look shitty compared to some of my peers, but there has to be a trade-off, and mine is biased towards lifestyle.

5 - Get a hobby. I love to start something and see incremental progress. Having something to look forward to is one of the best feelings in the world. Again, bonus if this is also exercise--two birds/one stone. 

6 - Triage. I frankly don't give a shit if my house is a little messy, if the dishes don't get washed until tomorrow, or if my car needs a wash all winter. That stuff is all important, but if there's no time, relationships, exercise, and sleep all get priority. Also, pay people to do stuff if you can afford it and don't enjoy it (cleaning, yardwork, home repair, etc.), and use that time to sleep and exercise. 

7 - Treat relationships as important, but not equally important. I greatly value my time these days, so I tend to only spend it on worthwhile relationships. 

8 - No social media. Just made me feel bad (and yes, I understand the hypocrisy of saying this from a Reddit account).

Nothing ground-breaking, and frankly I'm embarrassed that it took me a while to get into the swing of thinking about and doing this stuff.

I'm more curious to hear about people who are in extremely time-intensive fields and who also maintain good mental health. What kinds of actionable behaviors do you have that might benefit the rest of us?

"
medicine,"Single-payer will definitely be an improvement.  

Regarding ""designing a system"" - Noble intention and in an abstract sense, seems like it would work, but in reality classification of patients can be gamed to maximize profits.  When you say ""outcomes"" what you're really talking about has to be quantified in some manner (re-admissions, for example).  In principle it makes perfect sense, and then in reality the drive to lower readmission rates can result in an admission being delayed or reclassified in order not to jeopardize the metric, rather than the clinical need of the patient.

Any time you introduce new rules and regulations meant to administratively manipulate clinical outcomes, one needs to consider how the new rules will be actively gamed to the detriment of patients.

Under the current US system of multiple insurance companies it's much, much worse, and our current system already attempts to be a system where the most profitable decisions are the ones that provide the best patient outcomes on paper, again, not necessarily reflecting reality.

If a surgeon is letting their patient hang out with glucose in the 60s in AF RVR, it's because they are a bad doctor or just don't give a shit, not because these are mysterious and complex things to treat.

medicine,"As an addiction treatment physician I think that this is a great step forward.

However, it seems to me that a clonidine patch would work just as well at a fraction of the cost.  Add on some gabapentin (at least 1600 mg daily) and you can provide a very comfortable withdrawal for most patients.

That said, the majority of opioid dependent adults would be better served by life-long MAT with methadone or buprenorphine therapy.  The data are clear that MAT is superior to abstinence in regards to complications and mortality.  It's a sad fact but once a patient is hooked on opioids, their brain seems to be permanently altered and they are constantly at risk of relapse.  It's better that they be maintained on a replacement therapy rather than risk relapse on an illicit opioid.  Think insulin therapy for type one diabetics.   "

I'm not from the UK, but I think I can help you.
My understanding is that in the UK the ""N point"" acuity are strictly for testing at near. In the US, especially when treating low vision patients we will sometimes use Jeager notion at near  which look similar.  (J8, J10 etc)

Technically this is superior to snellen acuity at near.... but we mostly use snellen because it's easier. 

The snellen chart in the front of your book is intended to use for near testing.   

Here is a rough conversion:

* N4.5 20/20 
* N5   20/30 
* N6   20/40 
* N10 20/60

What are a few things I should know that is major\-related \(any specific beneficial college majors\)?

What is an ideal plan towards becoming a dermatologist \(or any sort of physician\)?

Are research\-based schools the best to apply for?

Are there any high school conferences \(preferably around Los Angeles, California\) that are specific for dermatology?

Is student debt an issue that is likely to appear on the path to becoming a dermatologist?

medicine,"&gt; If a drug rep buys you a sandwich, you are more likely to remember a successful Xiidra treatment than if that rep does not. 

Do you have any evidence that supports this?

&gt;This is basically case in point in why this type of marketing works. We have a drug with dubious evidence of a very small benefit that is being preferentially prescribed not because of good quality data, but for completely subjective reasons. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26365210
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28079022

We have data that supports Xiidra's efficacy vs placebo

&gt;Even if the drug did absolutely nothing, just their position as your first choice placebo nets them $5-600 a month for every person who randomly feels better after 2 weeks.

I think you're making broad incorrect assumptions about how I care for dry eye patients.  I don't throw Xiidra scripts at everyone who comes in with mild burning.  I use a step-ladder approach that includes artificial tears, punctal plugs, lid hygiene, and eventually goes to a challenge with generic topical steroid.  If the topical steroid works and symptoms recur after taper I set them up with long-term Xiidra.  It has worked wonders, but I guess you could discount everything and say it's all placebo?  

&gt;I'm not trying to attack you, I'm just pointing out that you're basically the perfect target for this marketing technique. Also, CsA will give your patients amazing eyelashes. +10 attractiveness points.

Yeah those were all based on clinical experience or physiologic reasoning. That's exactly why we need data.

&gt;We have data that supports Xiidra's efficacy vs placebo

We have data with applicability issues, and the effect size is embarrassingly small.

&gt;From my interactions with pharmacists, your crowd tends to be a little more ""by the books"" and gets uncomfortable with prescribing medications off label or using medications with different dosing schedules which aren't on the package insert.

I come from an CCU background; I don't even know what the label says most of the time. Data is data, and the FDA's review process is so unreliable I frankly don't care what they put on it. The data for Xiidra suggests that, in patients who don't use artificial tears, there is an extremely small difference in subjective and clinician-rated symptoms. 

&gt;I use a step-ladder approach that includes artificial tears, punctal plugs, lid hygiene, and eventually goes to a challenge with generic topical steroid. If the topical steroid works and symptoms recur after taper I set them up with long-term Xiidra. It has worked wonders, but I guess you could discount everything and say it's all placebo?

This is basically a good approach, the only thing I'm questioning is the Xiidra vs. Restasis decision. The data for both agents is poor, and therefore you're relying on subjective impressions to make prescribing decisions. These are the decisions most vulnerable to persuasion, and the reason that Pharma spends giant piles of money buying doctors meals. If your point is that your clinical experience is invulnerable to cognitive and recall biases, that would contradict just about everything that is known about psychology and all available research on marketing and incentives. 

Here's a decent summary for light reading. The TL;DR is basically that physicians don't think they're influenced by gifts despite the extensive evidence that they are. This thread is basically case-in-point.

medicine,"That’s kind of the point. Some true statements are analytically true - their truth depends on the definitions of the words used. Other statements are synthetically true - they happen to describe reality but it could be otherwise. For example, “Triangles are not round” is analytically true. There is no such thing as a round triangle because “triangle” describes something that intrinsically has three angles. “Round triangle” is nonsense necessarily.

On the other hand, “ID doctors are pedants” is true synthetically. It happens that every ID doctor is a pedant, but one could imagine a world in which that is not the case. “That ID doctor was totally pleasant and didn’t feel the need to correct every perceived error” is something we all understand, even if we know we will never experience it. 

“He was raised from the dead,” is a phrase that makes perfect sense to English speakers, even if it is something that has never occurred in reality. From the very fact that you can make sense of that notion, it follows that death does not denote permanence. “Death is irreversible,” is something you can believe, but at most this would be true synthetically. As it happens, sudden cardiac death is sometimes reversible so the statement is false."

medicine,I'm an MD and I have a food truck. You will not believe the stupidity and the disrespect you have to deal with when you run a food business.

medicine,"Pathologist here. In private practice, sure. In academics or a busy hospital, no way. 

Regarding seeing patients, depends on the hospital. In some, pathologists do thyroid FNAs and bone marrow biopsies. Apheresis/transfusion medicine involves a lot of direct patient care."
medicine,"I think of a resident like a grad student. Someone in their first year of a chemistry grad program might be pretty clueless, but by fourth+ year, they’re functionally a Ph.D. chemist because they are *doing* the research, writing papers, etc. So if I’m a patient and someone comes and introduces themselves as a resident, in my mind I will wonder where they are in training, but I will trust and respect them. I don’t think I’d judge them or have different expectations of them v. an attending. 

I guess I do have a vague idea of residents not having final say though? But again, I think of it like in a lab where I might not have authority, but my PI will listen to me and sign off on what I ask for as long as it makes sense (and can be paid for). That’s just the idea I’ve gotten over the years, please correct me where I’m wrong. 

Also I suspect you would get very different answers from laypeople who *don’t* lurk Meddit. "

medicine,"Our administration is transparent about the fact that their goal productivity for us is 105%. So they want us to be just a little bit understaffed at all times and send nurses home to keep things tight. 

I don’t know my patients’ names. And the “superfluous” things like ambulating patients rarely happen. And we unhinge our jaws to swallow whole for lunch. If I could identify the single biggest contribution to burnout, it would be not being able to do a good job despite giving our best. (I’m assuming doctors often feel the same way. I know our hospitalists do.) It’s so defeating to have patients and doctors and family members treating you like you’re incompetent. Why? Bc we ARE incompetent. Who could do it well?! It’s an impossible situation. Fuck cookies and cake. And fuck raises for that matter. It’s not more money I’m after. I’m not volunteering, obviously, but I make a decent living as a nurse. Car salesmen make more, but still, it’s not about the $. 

One obvious solution would be to allow us a secretary and maybe one or two more techs. They’re relatively cheap labor and would make an enormous difference. But the sound of admin clickity-clacking in their high heels is never a sound I hear on the floor. And raising these issues falls on deaf ears (or maybe just powerless ones, sentries to the real decision-makers). 

Uhhh, I think I just ranted and got angry about something I cannot control, which is an offense to the first rule of effectively managing burnout. Where are the cookies? Gimme. "

medicine,"I think “scribes” are a regional thing. I’ve worked in 4 different EDs and never once seen or had a scribe aside from fellow nurses. 

Had to take my mom to an ED in another state, for the life of me couldn’t figure out who the 2 ppl by the doc were. Had to ask to find out they were scribes. I was dumbfounded. And I’ve been an ED nurse for 12 years. "
medicine,"Hahaha we say “fall down go boom” as a diagnosis sometimes. "
medicine,"As a patient with autonomy, it’s absolutely his call (he was stating what he would want). I always ask my patients with mild symptoms if it’s something they could live with. If it is, then the risk outweighs the benefit. As a stroke doctor, if I had facial droop and some sensory changes I absolutely do not want tPA.

Your second line is a bit limited in view. Yes, it is possible to have an ICH lead to a worse neurological outcome; however, that is an n of 1. If you look at the trials, the likelihood of getting better outweighs the likelihood of getting worse even including people who have ICH."

medicine,"Double diluting always struck me as needlessly fiddly, and an opportune moment for errors in situation rich in stressors. 

I agree 10mcg is probably a nicer dose for 90% of this worrying group, but by the time anyone summons *me* to cath lab, I wind up giving the whole milligram about one time in five. 

50-250mcg bolus can be extremely useful for not actually doing cardiac compressions, especially if someone is scrubbing for ecmo cannulation. 

You need to communicate that well, though.

medicine,"&gt;We keep doing everything as long as the next of kin wants it, **even if the patient has a legal document that says not to.**

Wow, isn't this a violation of... something? What you describe is illegal here. If someone has some kind of guardian or representative appointed and the patient is for example against blood transfusions due to religious reasons, the guardian must follow that advice. If there is a legal document stating this wish, even if the patient will die due to loss of blood, it's not allowed to give a transfusion.

Seems really fucked up not to respect the patient's wishes. Patient autonomy is out of the window as soon as you're unconscious?

medicine,"I have been suffering from (HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS) for the past two years and had constant pain especially in my knees. During the first year,I had faith in God that i would be healed someday.This disease started circulating all over my body and i have been taking treatment from my doctor, few weeks ago i came on search on the internet if i could get any information concerning the prevention of this disease, on my search i saw a testimony of someone who has been healed from (HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS) by this Man Dr Aba and she also gave the email address: dr.abaherbalhome@gmail.com of this man and advise we should contact him for any sickness that he would be of help, so i wrote to Dr. Aba telling him about my (HERPES Virus) he told me not to worry that i was going to be cured!! hmm i never believed it,, well after all the procedures and remedy given to me by this man few weeks later i started experiencing changes all over me as the Dr assured me that i have cured,after some time i went to my doctor to confirmed if i have be finally healed behold it was TRUE, So friends my advise is if you have such sickness or any other at all you can email:: dr.abaherbalhome@gmail.com or whatsApp his number on +2348107155060 "

medicine,"There's a condition called familial benign hypercalcemia \(Blue Diaper Syndrome\) which apparently causes blue urine, but I doubt that's it.

medicine,"More commonly but it will prevent endogenous rapid correction. If you give them fluids and pop there ADH off, they might start rapid diuresis. It's manageable I suppose, but that's one strategy.

The article discusses both using it in patients who require 3% and also large volume resuscitation.

Agree its not appropriate for every patient (Little Old Lady with a 125 due to her Celexa) and the vast majority can be managed through their root causes but if you're gonna replete a hypovolemic hyponatremic with symptoms it seems a reasonable strategy. "

medicine,"I’m glad you posted this. A few months ago while on the Cardiology inpatient service, my attending blew my mind by telling me that low-salt diets for heart failure pts with normal renal function (e.g., Cr &lt;1.0-ish) doesn’t do as much as we thought it did. 

It’s basically ingrained in us that placing these pts on a low-salt diet (&lt;2g daily) is beneficial somehow (I imagined that it probably decreased hospital stay, or maybe even improved mortality). I’m on mobile and can’t link to the studies easily, but a quick lit search confirmed this; low-salt diets for hospitalized heart failure pts with normal renal function provided no benefits, and there was discussion it could have been slightly more harmful than liberalizing a bit to a 3- or 4-g diet. 

Anyone have any thoughts on this?"
