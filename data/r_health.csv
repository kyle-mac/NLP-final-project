Health,"I agree that waiting for RCTs that may never come - in the face of good epidemiological evidence - is foolish.  But my issue from the start was with your statements that (a) ""100,000 people die a year in the US taking medication as prescribed"" and that (b) ""96% of heart attacks in women can be prevented"".   Statement (a) breaks down when you look at the so-called ""study"" methods and a sample of the cases that comprise the ""100,000"", while statement (b) breaks down because it isn't supported by the study you cite, and because so many interventions based on the epidemiology of CHD have flopped when placed under the scrutiny of an RCT.  

Epidemiology is great and invaluable, but you should be a more circumspect consumer of it, and especially careful of your own biases when using epidemiology to support an argument.  Also, you should approach reductionism with respect for what it can do, rather than disdain on account of what it cannot do.  Be very wary when it contradicts what you are calling ""systemic research"".

There's actually a much more encouraging story about basic research and disease prevention to consider: the one intervention that has probably saved more lives than any other is the taking of one ""baby"" sized aspirin per day by persons at risk for CHD.  This recommendation arose from NIH-funded basic research into the detailed enzymology of arachidonic acid metabolism (oh so reductionist!), it has been proven of value in multiple RCTs, it's wonderfully cheap to implement, and there's little risk of adverse effects.  Yeah, reductionism can't solve all of our problems, but it's exceedingly sweet when it does score a big one.  Disregard it at your peril.

Association of Pharmaceutical Industry Marketing of Opioid Products to Physicians With Subsequent Opioid Prescribing. 

JAMA Internal Medicine, 2018 

DOI: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2018.1999

Link: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2681059

Abstract 

Despite the increasing contribution of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl to opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States, 40% of deaths involve prescription opioids.1 Prescription opioids are commonly the first opioid encountered in a trajectory toward illicit consumption.2 Although opioid prescribing has declined nationally, rates in 2015 were triple those in 1999 and remain elevated in regions of the country with higher numbers of overdoses.3

Pharmaceutical industry marketing to physicians is widespread, but it is unclear whether marketing of opioids influences prescribing.4 We studied the extent to which pharmaceutical industry marketing of opioid products to physicians during 2014 was associated with opioid prescribing during 2015.

Methods

We linked 2 US databases. From the Open Payments database, we obtained information on all transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to physicians (“payments”) during 2014.5 We identified all nonresearch payments involving opioid products, excluding buprenorphine hydrochloride marketed for addiction treatment. From the Medicare Part D Opioid Prescriber Summary File, we obtained information on all claims from physicians who wrote opioid prescriptions (initial or refill) filled for Medicare beneficiaries during 2015.6 We included all physicians with complete, nonduplicate information who had at least 10 opioid claims during 2015, and matched physicians across databases using name and location.7

We analyzed 2015 opioid claims in relation to marketing using multiple linear regression. Covariates included 2014 opioid claims and the change in total drug claims from 2014 to 2015. We also analyzed 2015 opioid claims in relation to opioid-related marketing meals in 2014, adjusting for these covariates and receipt of industry payments other than meals. Claims were log10-transformed to address skewed data. The study was considered exempt by the Brown University Institutional Review Board.

Results

In 2015, 369 139 physicians prescribed opioids under Medicare Part D and met study inclusion criteria. In 2014, 25 767 (7.0%) of these physicians received 105 368 nonresearch opioid-related payments totaling $9 071 976. Only 436 (1.7%) physicians received $1000 or more in total. The 3 companies with the highest payment totals were INSYS Therapeutics (which manufactures Subsys, the fentanyl sublingual spray; $4 538 286), Teva Pharmaceuticals USA ($869 155), and Janssen Pharmaceuticals ($854 251). Marketing included speaking fees and/or honoraria ($6 156 757; n = 3115), meals ($1 814 340; n = 97 020), travel ($730 824; n = 1862), consulting fees ($290 395; n = 360), and education ($79 660; n = 3011). Payments for meals were reported for 25 471 physicians and had a median payment value of $13 (interquartile range, $11-$17).

Total opioid claims for Medicare beneficiaries decreased from 60 055 242 in 2014 to 59 822 155 in 2015 (mean [SD] difference per physician, −0.6 [138.6]). Whereas physicians receiving no opioid-related payments had fewer opioid claims in 2015 than in 2014 (mean [SD] difference, −0.8 [114.4]), physicians receiving such payments had more opioid claims (mean [SD] difference, 1.6 [317.1]). In multivariable modeling, receipt of any opioid-related payments from industry in 2014 was associated with 9.3% (95% CI, 8.7%-9.9%) more opioid claims in 2015 compared with physicians who received no such payments (Table).

Each meal received in 2014 was associated with an increasing number of opioid claims in 2015 (Figure). In multivariable modeling, each additional meal was associated with an increase of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.6%-0.8%) in opioid claims.

Discussion

Of physicians who prescribed opioids under Medicare Part D, 7.0% received nonresearch payments related to opioid products in 2014. These payments were associated with greater opioid prescribing in 2015. One company, INSYS Therapeutics, accounted for 50% of the nonresearch payments.

Our findings add to prior studies of industry marketing to physicians by examining receipt of payments in 1 year and prescribing in the subsequent year, and adjusting for overall prescribing trends.

Limitations include the possibility of reverse causality because physicians who receive industry payments may be predisposed to prescribe opioids. Our findings establish an association, not cause and effect.

Amidst national efforts to curb the overprescribing of opioids, our findings suggest that manufacturers should consider a voluntary decrease or complete cessation of marketing to physicians. Federal and state governments should also consider legal limits on the number and amount of payments.

Health,"I wouldn't say he's fear\-mongering. There are valid concerns around recreational use, especially among teenagers, for instance a rather strong, but relatively unstudied, correlation between significant marijuana use in youth and schizophrenia. While I am strongly pro\-legalization, I do think, despite it being less dangerous by far than alcohol or tobacco, that like those its sale and use to children should be heavily regulated. It's by no means a bad drug, but it's no wonder drug either"

Microglial control of astrocytes in response to microbial metabolites. 

Nature, 2018;

Abstract

Microglia and astrocytes modulate inflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS)1,2,3. Microglia modulate pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic activities in astrocytes, but the mechanisms involved are not completely understood4,5. Here we report that TGFα and VEGF-B produced by microglia regulate the pathogenic activities of astrocytes in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Microglia-derived TGFα acts via the ErbB1 receptor in astrocytes to limit their pathogenic activities and EAE development. Conversely, microglial VEGF-B triggers FLT-1 signalling in astrocytes and worsens EAE. VEGF-B and TGFα also participate in the microglial control of human astrocytes. Furthermore, expression of TGFα and VEGF-B in CD14+ cells correlates with the multiple sclerosis lesion stage. Finally, metabolites of dietary tryptophan produced by the commensal flora control microglial activation and TGFα and VEGF-B production, modulating the transcriptional program of astrocytes and CNS inflammation through a mechanism mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. In summary, we identified positive and negative regulators that mediate the microglial control of astrocytes. Moreover, these findings define a pathway through which microbial metabolites limit pathogenic activities of microglia and astrocytes, and suppress CNS inflammation. This pathway may guide new therapies for multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders."

&gt; In the three-month period following a spouse’s death, widows and widowers are more likely to exhibit risk factors linked to cardiovascular illness and death, according to a new study.


&gt; “In the first six months after the loss of a spouse, widows/widowers are at a 41% increased risk of mortality…”
The study, which appears in Psychoneuroendocrinology, found that individuals who have lost a spouse within the last three months have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (immune markers that indicate inflammation in the bloodstream) and lower heart rate variability (HRV) compared with non-bereaved individuals who share the sex, age, body mass index, and educational level. Both are factors that increase an individual’s risk for cardiac events, including death. The study is the first to demonstrate that bereavement is associated with elevated levels of ex vivo cytokines and lower HRV.

Highlights

•Those who were spousally bereaved had lower HRV than those who were not bereaved.
•Widowers had higher ex vivo cytokine production than non-bereaved age-matched controls.
•These findings add to the growing literature revealing the mechanisms that underlie bereavement-related cardiovascular problems.

The loss of a spouse is a highly stressful event that puts people at excess risk of mortality. Excess mortality among those who are widowed is highest in the first six months after the death of a spouse and decreases over time. Heart disease accounts for the largest proportion of these deaths. The psychological stress associated with stressful life events can enhance inflammation and lower heart rate variability (HRV). Both lower HRV and higher inflammation are risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thirty-two recently bereaved individuals (Mean = 89.68 days since death, SD = 17.09) and 33 age-matched comparisons completed a blood draw, EKG, and self-report questionnaires. In both adjusted and unadjusted models, spousal bereavement was associated with enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by in vitro lipolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes. Moreover, spousal bereavement was associated with lower HRV in comparison to the comparison group. This study is the first to demonstrate that bereavement is associated with a more pronounced ex vivo cytokine production and lower HRV in a population that exclusively consisted of widows and widowers. These findings add to the growing literature revealing the mechanisms that underlie bereavement-related cardiovascular problems. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine the temporal relation between these risks. Understanding the biological mechanisms that underlie this stressful life event could allow researchers to create therapeutic targets for interventions to reduce or prevent the toll of a “broken heart.”"

""Surprisingly we found that vigorous physical activity in both age groups was positively associated with BMI, although the effect size was small and a dose effect was not consistent. Another study of 136,000 youths found that in 29 of 33 participating countries greater physical activity participation was associated with a lower risk of being overweight. Why our study found the opposite association is not clear, however an increase in BMI due to muscle gain from exercise might explain provide an explanation. Alternatively this could be a result of reverse causation, where children and adolescents are exercising more due to their elevated BMI or due to a reporting bias with greater recall of exercise among those with a higher BMI.

In both age groups eating nuts were associated with a lower BMI, and there was a dose effect...However, our finding is not consistent with a meta-analysis of 33 clinical trials which found that diets enriched with nuts compared with control diets did not increase or decrease BMI or waist circumference""

Summary

Previous studies have found a U‐shaped relationship between mortality and (weekday) sleep duration. We here address the association of both weekday and weekend sleep duration with overall mortality. A cohort of 43,880 subjects was followed for 13 years through record‐linkages. Cox proportional hazards regression models with attained age as time‐scale were fitted to estimate multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for mortality; stratified analyses on age (&lt;65 years, ≥65 years) were conducted. Among individuals &lt;65 years old, short sleep (≤5 hr) during weekends at baseline was associated with a 52% higher mortality rate (hazard ratios 1.52; 95% confidence intervals 1.15–2.02) compared with the reference group (7 hr), while no association was observed for long (≥9 hr) weekend sleep. When, instead, different combinations of weekday and weekend sleep durations were analysed, we observed a detrimental association with consistently sleeping ≤5 hr (hazard ratios 1.65; 95% confidence intervals 1.22–2.23) or ≥8 hr (hazard ratios 1.25; 95% confidence intervals 1.05–1.50), compared with consistently sleeping 6–7 hr per day (reference). The mortality rate among participants with short sleep during weekdays, but long sleep during weekends, did not differ from the rate of the reference group. Among individuals ≥65 years old, no association between weekend sleep or weekday/weekend sleep durations and mortality was observed. In conclusion, short, but not long, weekend sleep was associated with an increased mortality in subjects &lt;65 years. In the same age group, short sleep (or long sleep) on both weekdays and weekend showed increased mortality. Possibly, long weekend sleep may compensate for short weekday sleep."

Abstract

Background. Physically active lessons have not often been assessed with randomized controlled trials. Aims. Evaluate the effects of the “Virtual Traveller” (VT) intervention delivered using classroom interactive whiteboards on physical activity, on-task behavior, and student engagement. Methods. Participants were 219 children aged 8 to 9 years from 10 schools in Greater London, assessed in a cluster-randomized controlled trial between March 2015 and May 2016. For 6 weeks, intervention children received 10-minute VT sessions three times a week during math and English lessons (VT group: n = 113). Children in control schools received regular teaching (COM group: n = 106). Outcomes were school-day, weekend-day, and lesson-time sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and on-task behavior and student engagement, assessed at baseline (T0), 2 weeks (T1), and 4 weeks (T2) during the VT intervention and 1 week (T3) and 3 months (T4) postintervention using multilevel modeling. Results. VT pupils engaged in significantly more school-day MVPA at T1 only, with no other significant differences between groups in overall school-day or weekend-day activity. VT pupils engaged in significantly less SB and more MVPA during lesson time than COM pupils. More on-task behavior was shown in VT pupils than COM pupils but there was no difference in student engagement. Discussion. VT reduced sedentary behavior and increased physical activity during lesson time but not across overall school or weekend days. VT improved on-task behavior but had no effect on student engagement. Conclusion. Physical activity can be integrated into teaching using interactive whiteboards with no detriment to educational outcomes.

Abstract:

Despite the ubiquity and carcinogenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), their dermal absorption for the general population has not been adequately addressed. Aiming to verify the importance of dermal absorption of PAHs, barbecue (BBQ) in Guangzhou, China was chosen as a case study. Urine samples were collected and analyzed for nine hydroxyl (OH)-PAHs. Air, food, and cotton clothing samples were analyzed for 16 PAHs. Dietary exposure was the dominant exposure route with the greatest amounts of OH-PAH excretion and PAH intake. Dermal intake of low molecular-weight PAHs was greater than inhalation intake from the occurrence of atmospheric PAHs. In addition, the net excreted amounts of OH-naphthalene, OH-fluorene, OH-phenanthrene, and OH-pyrene via dermal absorption were 367, 63, 98, and 28 ng, respectively, upon 2.5-h exposure, comparable to those via combined dermal and inhalation exposure, which were 453, 98, 126, and 38 ng. The ratios of excretion to intake via dermal absorption were 0.11, 0.036, and 0.043 for fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene, respectively, lower than the ratios from dietary exposure (0.38, 0.14, and 0.060) but higher than the ratios from inhalation (0.097, 0.016, and 0.025). In the case of BBQ fumes, dermal absorption was a more important pathway for intake of low molecular-weight PAHs than inhalation.

This sensationalist approach leads to misunderstandings in the general population who, if they are not science literate, do not realise that a finding from a single paper is a jumping point, and needs to be replicated before being accepted as “true”. 

In regards to the addiction thing - i mention it as the original article was asking if sugar is the worlds most popular drug, arguing that it is addictive. As to whether sugar is a leading cause of obesity, and whether obesity is a massive killer is a separate thing. I think one of the papers I cited briefly discusses sugars contribution to the rising rates of obesity. Highly palatable foods are easier to “overeat” and may contribute, but the causes for obesity are way more complicated than the increased amounts of sugar the general population are eating. Humans are just ridiculously complicated and telling people that sugar is ‘bad’ and ‘naughty’ often ends up leading to greater consumption and increased saliency (this is the case with pretty much any food). So in general these fear mongering articles are just trite. "

Abstract: 

The present study provides an estimate of the U.S. economic impact of child sexual abuse (CSA). Costs of CSA were measured from the societal perspective and include health care costs, productivity losses, child welfare costs, violence/crime costs, special education costs, and suicide death costs. We separately estimated quality-adjusted life year (QALY) losses. For each category, we used the best available secondary data to develop cost per case estimates. All costs were estimated in U.S. dollars and adjusted to the reference year 2015. Estimating 20 new cases of fatal and 40,387 new substantiated cases of nonfatal CSA that occurred in 2015, the lifetime economic burden of CSA is approximately $9.3 billion, the lifetime cost for victims of fatal CSA per female and male victim is on average $1,128,334 and $1,482,933, respectively, and the average lifetime cost for victims of nonfatal CSA is of $282,734 per female victim. For male victims of nonfatal CSA, there was insufficient information on productivity losses, contributing to a lower average estimated lifetime cost of $74,691 per male victim. If we included QALYs, these costs would increase by approximately $40,000 per victim. With the exception of male productivity losses, all estimates were based on robust, replicable incidence-based costing methods. The availability of accurate, up-to-date estimates should contribute to policy analysis, facilitate comparisons with other public health problems, and support future economic evaluations of CSA-specific policy and practice. In particular, we hope the availability of credible and contemporary estimates will support increased attention to primary prevention of CSA."

Health,"The only diet proven to reveres heart disease, our number one killer is a whole food plant based diet."
Health,"1) Some 2/3 of women seeking abortions are already mothers- meaning that they've looked at sonograms, heard the heartbeat on the ultrasound, felt the kicks, and yes, held their newborn babies in their arms.  And yet . . . they still seek abortions, precisely because they know what it's like to have a child, they know what a child needs, and they know their financial and home situations are not right to have another one, yet.

2) That plain ol' doesn't work the way anti-abortion folks think it does:

&gt; *In one of the few studies of the issue — there have been none in the United States — two abortion clinics in British Columbia found that 73 percent of patients wanted to see an image if offered the chance. Eighty-four percent of the 254 women who viewed sonograms said it did not make the experience more difficult, and none reversed her decision.* ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/health/policy/28ultrasound.html))

3) Heck, I once did some research for a woman here on Reddit who was scared Planned Parenthood wouldn't let her see the ultrasound- [behold 17 Reddit commenters citing being offered to view the ultrasounds](http://cand86.tumblr.com/post/168790866838/viewing-ultrasounds-at-planned-parenthood).

4) And that's the thing- women know what a fetus and a sonogram look like.  We've all been inundated with the imagery, so it's not a surprise . . . and the women getting up on the table have thought long and hard about wanting an abortion.  Being forced to view the sonogram is either a boring formality, or, if she already knows this is the right choice but still finds it difficult, just makes it harder and sadder to do than it already was.  And if she's a woman having to terminate a wanted pregnancy, it can be utter torture."

Health,"Since someone else has already mentioned that she was suffering from an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients, I'll just add this:

""E-cigarettes heat liquid and turn it into vapor, which a user inhales and then exhales in a large puffy cloud. The liquid is known as e-juice, and it contains flavorings, propylene glycol, glycerin and often nicotine -- though many users are unaware of this final addictive ingredient.""

First of all, the ""large puffy cloud"" is kind of optional. A few users tweak their set-ups to maximize the size and visibility of their output, but most don't. And especially the types of users the article is about - teens using the tiny little vape pens - are all about *minimizing* the output - because it's illegal for them to use it anyway and they don't want to be seen. Their ""puffy clouds"" are probably no larger or more noticeable than your breath on a cold day. 

And more importantly - ""many users are unaware of this final addictive ingredient?!"" Are you for real?! I'm gonna need a source on that, it's kind of the whole point. There was even an entire paragraph prior waxing poetic about how the girl was a stressed out hostess at a restaurant wanting to try something to take the edge off. With nicotine.

I understand that vaping is not risk-free. Nicotine is a drug. I've just now had to quit using a new flavor that had something in it I turned out to be sensitive to. But it's better than smoking. I'd still be smoking without it. My husband would still be smoking without it. Every single person I've ever met who Vapes, does so as a substitute for smoking. By all means, make it as hard as possible for children to get it, but you don't have to make it out to be worse than it is."

Abstract

Objective To investigate the associations between using alternatives to the car which are more active for commuting and non-commuting purposes, and morbidity and mortality.

Methods We conducted a prospective study using data from 3 58 799 participants, aged 37–73 years, from UK Biobank. Commute and non-commute travel were assessed at baseline in 2006–2010. We classified participants according to whether they relied exclusively on the car or used alternative modes of transport that were more active at least some of the time. The main outcome measures were incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, and CVD, cancer and all-cause mortality. We excluded events in the first 2 years and conducted analyses separately for those who regularly commuted and those who did not.

Results In maximally adjusted models, regular commuters with more active patterns of travel on the commute had a lower risk of incident (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00) and fatal (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.95) CVD. Those regular commuters who also had more active patterns of non-commute travel had an even lower risk of fatal CVD (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.85). Among those who were not regular commuters, more active patterns of travel were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99).

Conclusions More active patterns of travel were associated with a reduced risk of incident and fatal CVD and all-cause mortality in adults. This is an important message for clinicians advising people about how to be physically active and reduce their risk of disease.

Either way the system is fucked if you can walk into a hospital, get little to no care, and walk out with a bill for $5,000. Even more fucked when the hospital feels the need to amend the bill because of public inquiry. A legitimate charge would not fall victim to close examination.

But with copay assistance, I which Amgen gives me a MasterCard to keep on file with my speciality pharmacy, I pay $0 ( besides my monthly insurance premium). Another plus to this is it typically knocks my out of pocket costs out early in the year, again I pay $0 per month, but the insurance company counts the copay assistance payments by Amgen toward paying off my out of pocket.

- Selection bias across populations. India has a mostly vegetarian population yet horrible health. Short lifespan, low average intelligence, heart disease, stroke, cancer, widespread vitamin B12 deficiency. Israel also fares poorly. They could do so much better.

- Selection bias across time. Some were investigated after World War 2, where young populations were killed off, economy ruined, and supply of animal products were disrupted, but also of sugar and processed oils. This gave the illusion of longevity and vegan diets, but could not have been further from the truth.

- Selection bias across outcomes. Only report favorable diseases, and not others. Multiple Sclerosis is one example where low carb clearly wins, and vegan diets are detrimental.

- Confounders. Smoking, pollution, stress, social life, exercise, clime, ocean air do matter and have nothing to do with diet. Notice how blue zones are always near the equator and some large body of water?

- Religious propaganda. The Seventh-Day Adventist Church loves to spread its beliefs by sponsoring favorable studies. Always amazes me that John Harvey Kellogg's neuroticism about masturbation is how we got cereal for breakfast and other nonsense.

Health,"Have  you ever been to your dentist’s office and found out that you have a  [cavity](https://www.highlandoakdental.com/what-you-should-know-about-cavity-formation/)? If so, did you wonder how the cavity formed? Did you know that  cavities actually form in stages, or that you might be able to reverse  your cavity before it’s too serious?

You see after you eat, your  teeth will be exposed to plaque and tartar. This can eventually weaken  the outer layer of your teeth, also known as enamel. Brushing and  flossing are very important to keeping plaque and bad bacteria away from  your pearly whites, but even if you take care of your teeth extremely  well, your enamel could still be damaged. If your enamel is hurt, you  might notice discoloration on your teeth. Fortunately, this issue can be  reversed. However, if you fail to address this enamel decay, it could  continue to spread quickly. If this happens, the cavity will need to be  filled by a dentist. Luckily, you can often recognize dark spots on your  teeth if you have this stage of tooth decay.

[Tooth decay](https://www.highlandoakdental.com/) can also  get into your dentin, which is the soft layer under your enamel. Sadly,  when this happens, decay might also spread to the pulp inside your  tooth, which can impact connective tissue and your tooth’s nerves. If  this happens, you could need root canal therapy. If it is not addressed,  your decay can spread farther and ultimately affect your jaw.

Typically,  you can avoid these problems by keeping your teeth clean at home and by  [scheduling an appointment ](https://www.highlandoakdental.com/)with our team every six months. "

Health,"Comparing statisitics for something like autism 20 years ago vs today is not a very accurate thing to do. 

Autism wasnt even included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders UNTIL 1980. In 1987, a new edition expanded the criteria by allowing a diagnosis even if symptoms became apparent after 30 months of age. 

To garner a diagnosis, a child needed to meet 8 of 16 criteria, rather than all 6 of the previous items. This would definitely increase the statistic for children with autism

Before 1991 children with autism were categorized as having ""an intellectual disability"" which could have kept that statistic low for a little bit as well. 

It's not the fact that Autism has necessarily been on the rise in the past few decades, it's the fact that we have learned more about autism and can categorize autism a lot better. 

There's not a blood test or any kind of fully objective test to find out if a child has autism, it's all been done by psychiatrists who learn more and more as time goes on, keep that in mind.

I hope this doesn't come off as me personally attacking you, that is not my intention I just hope to shed some light on your perspective that maybe wasn't as clear before."

Diet, Nutrition, Physical Activity and Cancer: a Global Perspective
The Third Expert Report

The Continuous Update Project (CUP) is the world's largest, most authoritative and up-to-date source of scientific research on cancer prevention and survivorship through diet, nutrition, physical activity and cancer

https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer

Link: https://www.wcrf.org/sites/default/files/Summary-third-expert-report.pdf

A landmark in cancer prevention

Our independent panel of global experts has been evaluating the evidence on cancer prevention for many years. The 2018 report is our third comprehensive analysis since 1997 of the worldwide body of research available.

A COLLABORATION

This internationally acclaimed report is a collaboration between four organisations under the umbrella of the World Cancer Research Fund network:

World Cancer Research Fund International
The American Institute for Cancer Research
Wereld Kanker Onderzoek Fonds
World Cancer Research Fund Hong Kong

A unique, global database

The first and second Expert Reports, when they were published in 1997 and 2007, respectively, were landmarks in the science of cancer prevention. Since the second report, scientists at Imperial College London have been adding information to a unique and growing database of evidence relating to cancer prevention and diet, nutrition and physical activity. This forms the basis of our flagship Continuous Update Project (CUP), an ongoing analysis of evidence related to diet and cancer prevention. Evidence from the CUP enables World Cancer Research Fund to publish reports on individual cancer types, the most recent being our report on colorectal cancer in 2017.

Authoritative, evidence-based Cancer Prevention Recommendations

In the past ten years, the need for authoritative, evidence-based recommendations on how to reduce the global burden of cancer has grown. There is strong evidence from the CUP, for example, that being overweight or obese puts you at increased risk of many cancers. We are experiencing a global obesity epidemic, declining physical activity among both children and adults in many parts of the world, and an increase in the consumption of energy-dense foods. If these current trends continue, overweight and obesity are likely to overtake smoking as the number one risk for cancer."

Abstract

Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the pathogens most often responsible for the common cold, and are a frequent cause of exacerbations in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Here we report the discovery of IMP-1088, a picomolar dual inhibitor of the human N-myristoyltransferases NMT1 and NMT2, and use it to demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of host-cell N-myristoylation rapidly and completely prevents rhinoviral replication without inducing cytotoxicity. The identification of cooperative binding between weak-binding fragments led to rapid inhibitor optimization through fragment reconstruction, structure-guided fragment linking and conformational control over linker geometry. We show that inhibition of the co-translational myristoylation of a specific virus-encoded protein (VP0) by IMP-1088 potently blocks a key step in viral capsid assembly, to deliver a low nanomolar antiviral activity against multiple RV strains, poliovirus and foot and-mouth disease virus, and protection of cells against virus-induced killing, highlighting the potential of host myristoylation as a drug target in picornaviral infections."

The rest of it does make sense when we can end up paying 5 times more for the same drugs that are cheaper everywhere else (even when they are made here). As for the labor costs, one need only look at the shortage of qualified personnel and skyrocketing education costs in this country to find the origins of that one. "

&gt; ""We had this overriding hypothesis that there must be something odd about the metabolism of obese people,"" Prentice says. ""And the world was spending hundreds of millions of dollars doing very detailed and complicated experiments trying to track down these defects.""                                                                                  
                 
But due to his research and others it has become plain that there is one very simple explanation, that there is no mystery and any apparent mystery that calls for these myriad ""it's nobody's fault"" ideas are simply a distraction from the real problem and very probably actively harmful as they lead people to believe that they will be obese whatever they do.

Health,"All refined wheat. It's stripped of all of its good stuff (fibre, minerals) which makes it more convenient to use in the kitchen (much easier baking, last longer because of the lack of fibre). 

Problem is all that's left of it is starch, which, if not accompanied by adequate amounts of fibre spikes your insulin levels. It ends up being metabolised the same as if you were eating sugar, and any excess amount goes to tryglycerides and it contributes to weight gain.

Another relevant thing to add: Saturated fats from animal sources, or unrefined oils like coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil etc. leave HDL intact and slightly lower LDL cholesterol.

Man made, processed, hydrogenized oils are also saturated, but labeled as trans fats. Their main purpose is to give foods long shelf life for very low cost. They lower HDL and raise LDL. I think it's obvious what you should avoid.

Health,"I got this mesh five years ago and really I haven’t noticed anything crazy except that there is definitely a bit of tugging on my groin on the side that the mesh is on and occasionally I’ll feel a little bit of tenderness in the testicle that’s on the same side as the mesh. It seems like it’s maybe on a little bit too tight, I can even see my abdomen doesn’t stick out as far on that side when I stick my belly out. 

I was told at the time that it was far superior to just suturing the hernia shut, and from a physical perspective it makes sense. Tying the fibers back together would increase pressure on the fibers above and below the hernia. Rate of recurrence was relatively high for the invasiveness of the suture procedure, so it really seemed like a no-brainer to get the mesh. 

In all, it seems like we just don’t have a great way of repairing hernias given how invasive the suture procedure is and how many complications we’re seeing with the mesh. "

1. dad says he paid about $20 a month for years before the hospital would write off a bill. 
2.some hospitals will ask you to bring in your financial statements so they can decide what you can pay.
3. I've tried to negotiate multiple bills after insurance or after insurance refused to pay and the hospital said no, or at best only willing to knock 100 off 10k in bills...(i made about 25k a year and Ended up paying all of it with my savings so that sucked)
4. I've let some go to collections and they knocked about half off if I paid that day.
5.I've also had a friend have a procedure for her son told by the front office if you don't have insurance the bill is 25 while if you have insurance they bill insurance and both you and the insurance company will pay more than the no insurance person. 
I've also been duped into hospital and doctor services I didn't need because they were trying to collect extra payments from me.

Health,"Extracts from article

""Just as antibiotics breed resistance in bacteria, vaccines can incite changes that enable diseases to escape their control.""

...

""Just as the mammal population exploded after dinosaurs went extinct because a big niche opened up for them, some microbes have swept in to take the place of competitors eliminated by vaccines.""

...

""Immunization is also making once-rare or nonexistent genetic variants of pathogens more prevalent, presumably because vaccine-primed antibodies can’t as easily recognize and attack shape-shifters that look different from vaccine strains.""

...

""Evolutionary biologists aren’t surprised that this is happening. A vaccine is a novel selection pressure placed on a pathogen, and if the vaccine does not eradicate its target completely, then the remaining pathogens with the greatest fitness — those able to survive, somehow, in an immunized world — will become more common. “If you don’t have these pathogens evolving in response to vaccines,” said Paul Ewald, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Louisville, “then we really don’t understand natural selection.”""

...

""Although infections in kids there have dropped, invasive pneumococcal infections have been steadily increasing in older adults and are much higher now than they were before Prevnar 7 was introduced. As for why this is happening, “I don’t think we know,”""

...

""One can think about vaccination as a kind of sieve, argues Troy Day, a mathematical evolutionary biologist at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada. This sieve prevents many pathogens from passing through and surviving, but if a few squeeze by, those in that nonrandom sample will preferentially survive, replicate and ultimately shift the composition of the pathogen population""

....

""Still, he and Kennedy feel researchers are starting to recognize the need to include evolution in the conversation. “I think the scientific community is becoming increasingly aware that vaccine resistance is a real risk,” Kennedy said.

“I think so too,” Read agreed, “but there is a long way to go.”""

You’re just shaming people who use food to cope with those impulses as well as fear mongering. Without addressing the actual cause of the impulse, people will refocus that energy elsewhere on other self destructive ways...spending habits, unprotected sex, drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, etc. Oh, and there’s already time to deal with the impulse while shopping and paying.

I know some Zen and perhaps other monks and nuns can marry, I actually had been reading a bit about what it's like for a Zen monk to marry in places like Japan, Korea, and mainland China. There's actually an eagerness from the devout public for more married monks, as they feel that this way the monks and spiritual leaders will be able to understand and help them better with their marriage related issues in a spiritual context. There's opposition of course, mainly from more traditional monks that live in celibacy, but apparently a lot of them change their minds after examining the situation of the subordinate's (monks have to ask for the blessing of a superior before getting married IIRC) situation. 

As to the effects on mind and body after the loss of a spouse, close friend or loved one, I don't doubt it would affect even a monk who has been studying for years, we're all human and sentient after all"

Health,"Lol no reality TV for me. I based that comment on a book called The Social Conquest of Earth by EO Wilson. In part it argues that religions reflect the needs of the culture where they originated. Christianity, which drives many of the antiabortion arguments, reflects the needs of a society that requires its members to breed at maximum capacity so they can outcompete “the others.” Females control population growth, thus it is beneficial for men to keep female reproduction under their control. 

Prior to birth control and genetic testing, the only way for a man or his family to know if his offspring were his own was to marry a virgin and keep her to himself.  How do you know who is part of your family and your tribe, verses who are “the others” that you are competing with for resources? You keep track of your family members using marriage.  That’s why bastards and prostitutes are disadvantageous to society; they convolute the genealogy.  So religion discourages those behaviors by making them a sin.  Same with homosexuality; no babies equals a sin.  When Christianity arose it was advantageous to treat women like breeding stock, which is what most major religions do.

Christianity served the needs of the society where it developed.  The needs of our society and species are very different now. Unlimited procreation is no longer advantageous. I see no need to force women to have children they do not want when we so desperately need to slow the human population growth. And I really dislike having laws based on outdated beliefs hurting our country and planet. "

The problem is vaccines are too effective.  If the polio vaccine prevented 50% of cases, say 30% of the people you knew would die of polio and the others had a good chance of being paralyzed for life.  Everyone would make sure they got the vaccine, just because the disease is so horrible, because maybe they'd be a lucky one and not get the disease.  

Instead, we have 100% of people that are vaccinated not get the disease.  We have had 2 generations of people grow up without knowing anybody with polio.  We've simply forgotten how bad the disease is.  So when I go vaccinate my kid and 6 months later, he/she has autism, it couldn't possibly be my genes or the fact that I live in a polluted area and my genes have mutated in a way that affects my children or maybe it's the fact that I drink too much, don't exercise, and need to lose some weight.

Abstract:

Purpose

The prevalence of unhealthy dietary behaviors among adolescents is high. We examined the effect of having health-oriented food rules at home on the healthiness of adolescents' independent food choices, and the necessity of parental oversight for such rules to be effective.

Methods

We surveyed a socioeconomically and racially diverse San Francisco Bay Area public high school in May 2017 (N = 1,246). We used ordinal logistic regressions to assess the relationships between adolescent-reported presence of health-oriented food rules at home and the healthiness of snacks selected by adolescents in a raffle, which included a randomized controlled experiment to manipulate the level of parental approval students needed to pick up their snacks.

Results

Adolescents reporting at least one health-oriented food rule at home were significantly more likely to choose healthier snacks in the raffle (adjusted odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41–2.45). Telling adolescents that a parent needed to approve the snacks did not have a significant effect on snack choice healthiness relative to a no-approval baseline condition (adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI .55–1.86). Post hoc analyses suggest that rules may affect adolescent food-related attitudes and perceptions of parental reactions; for example, adolescents with rules reported that their parents would be more disappointed (adjusted mean difference on five-point scale, .5; 95% CI .36–.64) if they made an unhealthy food choice.

Conclusions

Having health-oriented food rules at home is associated with healthier snack choices. Findings suggest that adolescents with rules also hold beliefs that may correspond to healthier independent dietary choices.

Health,"I already explained in my initial comment. What he brings to the table is a voice that a big chunk of people in this country follow. He is being utilized as a megaphone to convey the recommendations of the council to the people, if the President chooses to have that message conveyed. Are you disagreeing that he would be a great fit for that particular role? Also, you are assuming that every single one of his contributions would be completely worthless to the council. I watched one of his shows on cholesterol recently. I didn't see him peddling any drugs or alternative medicine for which you claim he gets paid for. All he was offering was a different perspective as compared to mainstream medicine. Are you claiming that mainstream medicine, with all its peer reviews gets it a 100% right each time? Do you truly believe that mainstream medicine practitioners have zero vested interests in propagating the solutions they do? If you are not naive enough to believe that, why would you be so opposed to a voice that is not telling you stop using mainstream medicine, but rather just stop and question it a bit and make an informed decision knowing there are other less known choices available to you. Just because he has been maligned left and right by the media (whose ethics I have truly come to question within the past 2-3 years) and the mainstream medicine practitioners, does not mean he has no utility in the council for a very specific role.

And by the way, I have no issues with someone profiting by making public appearances.

**Abstract**

The authors identified individual randomized controlled trials from previous meta-analyses and additional searches, and then performed meta-analyses on cardiovascular disease outcomes and all-cause mortality. The authors assessed publications from 2012, both before and including the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force review. Their systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed generally moderate- or low-quality evidence for preventive benefits (folic acid for total cardiovascular disease, folic acid and B-vitamins for stroke), no effect (multivitamins, vitamins C, D, β-carotene, calcium, and selenium), or increased risk (antioxidant mixtures and niacin [with a statin] for all-cause mortality). Conclusive evidence for the benefit of any supplement across all dietary backgrounds (including deficiency and sufficiency) was not demonstrated; therefore, any benefits seen must be balanced against possible risks."

Abstract

Positive subjective perceptions of aging predict various well-being, physical health, mental health, and longevity outcomes. Thus, it is important to consider what factors contribute to their formation. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been hypothesized to be one such factor, but past research has been mixed. We propose that subjective assessments of SES may better predict subjective perceptions of aging than traditional objective measures (e.g., income and education). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of objective and subjective indicators of SES on subjective perceptions of aging. Participants (n = 296) from the Mindfulness and Anticipatory Coping Everyday study were recruited with a Human Intelligence Task on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Participants reported on their SES (i.e., income, education, and subjective social status) and subjective perceptions of aging (i.e., attitudes toward own aging, subjective age, and awareness of age-related gains and losses). Data were analyzed via hierarchical multiple regression with demographic and health variables entered first, followed by income and education, then subjective social status. Results demonstrated that although objective measures of SES did not contribute to predicting subjective perceptions of aging, those who rated themselves subjectively higher in their community social standing were more likely to possess positive aging attitudes, younger subjective ages, more awareness of age-related gains, and fewer awareness of age-related losses. These findings suggest that perceptions of doing better than one’s neighbors (i.e., “the Joneses”) may matter more for understanding subjective perceptions of aging than objective indicators of social status.

If you lose a wee bit of something to a pest in your garden, it's an annoyance. Losing a crop due to a particular pest is a disaster for whomever has that happen to them.

My relatives have written off apple in their garden due to coddling moth. They don't have the time, expertise, and equipment to spray controls at the right time/s, in the right amounts, on their three widely spaced apple trees. That's just one little example of dozens of actual dilemmas that would be a disaster for a farmer.

They gave up on the apples, this after years of success. Everyone who tries apple where I live ends up with the same dilemma. 

Conventional and organic farmers have to use well timed controls on the whole of their orchards. Organic controls for the moth on mass scale are more expensive and extensive than conventional options. It'll also help if the organic farmer is surrounded by conventional farmers, because they'll do a better job of controlling the same pest so it's causing them less grief.

BTW, organic apple farmers don't have an organic option for fireblight, so they give themselves an exception, and use what conventional farmers use(antibiotic applications)."

Quote from article:  ""Adjustment for physical activity did not affect the positive association between sedentary behavior and cancer. This indicates that the increased risk of cancer seen in individuals with prolonged time spent sedentary is not explained by the mere absence of physical activity in those persons. Support is provided by observations of significant positive relations of TV viewing time to metabolic risk and mortality, even in physically active adults \( 89 , 90 \). That sedentariness has a detrimental impact on cancer even among physically active persons implies that limiting the time spent sedentary may play an important role in preventing cancer, even against the background of achieving the physical activity recommendations."""

The North promised to end hostile activities, and the South paid millions of dollars in cash and humanitarian aid.  Even if they sign some kind of agreement, North Korea can, and probably will, do what it did the last few times -- claim some kind of grievance or break in the terms of the agreement, and then walk away.

Kidnapping or imprisoning foreigners for use as bargaining chips later is North Korean government standard operating procedure.  

I will believe that peace between North and South is real when the border comes down, all the North Korean political prisoners are released, and the Kim Jung family dynasty gives up it's hold on power.

But again, you would have to be as gullible as Trump to believe that they would be willing to give up their power and let themselves be ruled by law.  They have too many secrets and committed too many war crimes to be able to transition to democratic rule scot free.

No, the North Koreans will soak the international community and the USA for money, and then make up some excuse to walk away.  And do you know who is going to encourage them to do it?  The people who manufacture and sell military weapons and equipment to the USA.    Just like they have done in the past.

Health,"I mean, I don’t really know how to scientifically answer that question. What I know is based on the little information and stuff I read, and what I learn from studying something which is kind of medically related. 

Most antivaxxers worry about the other ingredients because, on their own, they do cause harm to the body, however combined with other ingredients the effects change to be non-harmful or even beneficial. It’s on a way, kind of similar to what happens when you are cooking. Most raw ingredients are potentially harmful but when they go through the whole chemical process we call “cooking” it all ends up being good for you. 

Also, I’m vaccinated and all the people I know are, I haven’t seen anyone developing anything weird enough to think it is based on a vaccine. Only one of the vaccines I had put me on bed for a long time, but they stopped providing it with the years for that same reason (most kids would get sick after getting it). 

I think anti vaxxers are missing the biggest picture. They think of science and health as a big scam to get more money created by some greedy people. I don’t really blame them because if I lived in a country in which health is more of a business than a right, I might think the same. But vaccines and medications are always developing. Health science is always evolving on a way that’s beneficial for us. 

Every country has a lot of people in charge of deciding if the medications provided to everyone are safe enough. Again, anti vaxxers ser them as some kind of greedy doctors trying to sell you something. 

I wish I could provide you with more scientifically accurate answers, but feel free to ask! It’s better to look for answers than to just go with “most people are saying this is good so it must be”."

Third, there are many ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" scenarios in medicine.  For example, in acute embolic stroke, you must weigh whether it is more important to anticoagulate and risk bleeding but possibly prevent another embolic stroke, or not treat and avoid the risk of bleeding.  In the view of many, it would be malpractice to not treat in this situation, despite the very high risks of treatment!

Health,"It depends on many things such as age and kidney health. I had an elderly person get chronic kidney damage from taking a daily supplement which should have been a weekly supplement. "
Health,"All the cardiology and heart health associations agree that you should exercise:

1) 30 min a day if done every day of the week (specially good if you suffer from type 1 DM)
2) 45-60 min a day if done only 3 days per week (which I think most people that exercise casually do)

As for the question of what qualifies exercise: you should always achieve your submaximal heart rate, which is about 70-85% of your maximal heart rate (70 if you are just starting out and increasing gradually to 85 as you get more comfortable with it)

Your theoretical max heart rate can be calculated by the following formula:
*Max BPM = (220 - your age)*

Once you have your max BPM, you have to calculate the 70-85% of that, and the number obtained is the submax BPM in your case.

Why should this matter to you? Because the submax BPM is the line that separates exercise that improves your heart health, from the exercise that increases the chance of a CV event from the exercise itself (ie: Acute Heart Arrest)

Also, take into account that the exercise that benefits you the best is the aerobic type. Things like weight lifting should always be treated as a plus to your exercise routine and NEVER as the core of it, as those kind of exercise (anaerobic type ones) have a greater chance to negatively influence your heart’s health. This kind of anaerobic exercise should only be done for 15 min per session, alternating with aerobic exercises.

For those really interested in calculating their REAL max BPM rate, you should take the submax BPM you calculated earlier and do as the following:

Take (your Submax BPM -  your normality BPM (your normal heart rate when you are in a relaxed situation))
With that you obtain your Reserve BPM (as in, how much BPM is your heart able to increase until it starts being dangerous to you)

Once you have your Reserve BPM, calculate the 70-85% of it (as you did to obtain your submax BPM rate) and add it to your normality BPM.

The number obtained would be your REAL max BPM. Bellow that level you can be sure that the exercise you do is benefitting your health.

Also as a curiosity: studies show that exercising following the recommendations exposed above plus eating healthy, reduces the probability of having a CV event in the following 10 years by 50%!!!

Edit: It seems people are taking these recommendations to seriously. Take into account these are all that, recommendations. These are values obtained from studying large populations, so they give an idea of what should be a good safety limit for you, considering your age and your age alone. There are far more complex and more accurate ways of calculating your max BPM and your “safety zone”. However, at the end of the day, what will determine that the exercise you do is not influencing you negatively, is that it doesn’t cause symptoms as: difficulty breathing, dizziness, chest pain, headaches, loss of conscience... 
In short, people are very different from one another. It’s not the same if you have been active your whole life than you having done no exercise whatsoever (your blood vessels would be way stiffer if you have never exercised, resulting in a higher chance of them being damaged). Also, don’t freak out if you surpass the values you obtained at some point in your exercise routine, as the important thing is that you feel comfortable doing it. Try to stay under these values most of the time, but it doesn’t matter if you surpass them punctually.

Dozens of published peer reviewed scientific papers. And testing in pigs would get started in a year or two.

When that happens we'll see negligible improvements at best, but most likely we'd see negative results.

Yup because it's actually chocolate instead of sugar.

I have anxiety and I've never heard that, so can you source it?  Avoiding sugar does help me, but caffeine as long as I'm not drinking 10 cups per day is fine.  I did 7 cups/day for a while.  For other people, coffee affects more and they'll have tolerance issues on 1 cup.  It takes me 4+ to develop tolerance issues.

Coffee though is the major antioxidant in the US diet, so don't throw the bad out with the good.

As someone very familiar with coffee and dark chocolate, the dark chocolate theobromine (similar to caffeine, but not actually) has a longer high than caffeine."

Well, technically just about any drug in moderation is not dangerous - 'moderation' being the key word here. But if you look at the list of most dangerous drugs, alcohol frequently makes the top 5.

Mind you, I'm not saying we should outlaw it (since we've tried that already), but it deserves to be stigmatized, same as other dangerous drugs like cocaine and heroin. And it sure as hell shouldn't be sold for public consumption:

Drs don’t bother to inform their patients to stop taking them and patients don’t even bother to ask their doctors why they’re taking it. Also since it’s available as OTC, lots of consumers do not heed the directions on the label that say to only take the OTC version for 2 weeks.

&gt;In fact, a yet-to-be-published study that found no link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, may have changed IARC’s 2015 analysis of the herbicide had it been published.

&gt;Aaron Blair, an emeritus scientist at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, who contributed to the unpublished study and led IARC’s review of glyphosate, said the study “would have made it less likely that glyphosate would meet the agency’s criteria for being classed as ‘probably carcinogenic,’” reported Reuters in June 2017.

&gt; ...

&gt;The European Chemicals Agency, for example, concluded in March 2017 that “the available scientific evidence did not meet the criteria to classify glyphosate as a carcinogen.” This assessment, like IARC’s, looked for any potential cancer hazard glyphosate may pose to humans at any dose, not the actual cancer risk it poses at a specific dose.

Health,I don’t think it helps that marijuana is a Schedule 1 drug so that MDs can’t find sufficient research even if they wanted to
Health,"Según el artículo adjuntado, en nuevos estudios realizado por la Universidad de 
California, un grupo de científicos ha identificado muchas variaciones que posiblemente estén afectando el desarrollo del cerebro en formas que aumenten el riesgo de tener autismo. Dichos estudios se han enfocado en la parte no codificada del ADN, conocida como ""basura del ADN"" (junk DNA), la cual había sido ignorada por su poco valor científico.
El estudio muestra que las alteraciones en las regiones que regulan la actividad genética podrían aportar estímulos que produzcan el autismo. Luego de examinar un grupo de personas, se llegó a la conclusión que los hijos heredan mutaciones por parte de la madre que afectan las zonas codificadas; mientras que, por el lado paterno, heredan mutaciones que afectan las regiones del ""ADN basura""; alteraciones que estarían asociadas al autismo. Las madres sólo pasarían hasta el 50%, mientras que padres más del 50%.

Mi opinión está ligada al concepto de ser humano, el cuál tiene derecho, en todos lados al reconocimiento de su personalidad jurídica, la cual tiene derechos y deberes que deben exigirse y cumplirse. En este caso se entendería que el autista es incapaz relativo, más no mera vida biológica, como lo plantearía Engelhardt. La persona, aún con alteraciones biológicas que le impiden razonar, comportarse y expresarse como la considerada ""persona normal"" (término que tiene muchas interpretaciones por la sociedad cambiante y multicultural en la que vivimos), mantiene, como indica Spaemann, ""miembro de la sociedad humana [...] en virtud del propio derecho"".
Por lo tanto, este caso retrata un perfecto ejemplo de persona, la cual debería entenderse ya por lo explicado, con todos sus derechos, inherentes a la misma. Con o sin uso apropiado de la razón, con o sin noción de la realidad, con o sin hábitos sociales; esto último porque se conoce el estado de alerta y, en algunos casos, hostilidad, en el que se encuentran las personas que padecen de autismo. ¿Eso les quita el derecho a ser persona? ¿Acaso por el uso inadecuado de la razón, debemos negarles un lugar en la sociedad?
De ser así, en el espacio-tiempo que vivimos, muchos conductores limeños junto con las personas hostiles que deambulan por las calles, ¿serían excluidos sólo por su falta de raciocinio? Sería totalmente incoherente.
Por último, el hallazgo de las mutaciones heredadas, en su mayoría por los padres, muestra nuestra poca comprensión de nosotros mismos. Seres que apuntan al espacio, en busca de civilizaciones diferentes, de vida, de nuevos horizontes; cuando el universo más complejo, enmarañado, diverso y desconocido del que tenemos conocimiento, está dentro de cada uno. Empecemos por lo conocido, lo desconocido puede esperar.

Health,"&gt; Consciousness itself arose from those simple building blocks. How can you possibly assert that free will can’t emerge from it as well?

The same way I can assert the easter bunny isn't real. There is zero evidence as to the existence of free will outside of our feeling that it exists. Guess what other claim uses a ""feeling"" as a basis for believing something exists? By the way, if you're a theist, I probably just insulted you, for which I apologize. If you are, there's no point in us having this discussion.

&gt; But that all depends on your definition of free will I guess.

It's hard to define free will, since there's absolutely no way to test for it; it's like trying to describe what one hand clapping sounds like. So, I will say what it *isn't*. When I say you have no free will, I mean you have zero control of your thoughts, zero control of your actions, and zero control of your life. In other words, you are a biological, human machine."
Health,"She had a minor outpatient procedure done and ended up staying in the hospital for three days?  Sounds like the whole story isn't being told, but it certainly fits with the insurance company refusing to pay for her hospitalization.

Edit:  also, those are 2.4 cannulated headless compression screws - they sure are expensive - the threads have a variable pitch and they have to be machined to pretty extreme tolerances in order not to fail after implantation.  They are quite a great deal more expensive than a run of the mill orthopedic screw, although there is no way the hospital contract with Arthrex is that favorable to the device company.  Looks like a classic case of overinflation of the charge register in order to obtain reasonable compensation from insurance companies.

Edit:

&gt;While screws can be used only once, there's no reason that other surgical equipment, such as saw blades, should be disposable, Rickert said. Hospitals routinely sterilize tools such as scalpels and scissors, then use them again.

Yes there absolutely is a reason.  Firstly, hospitals don't reuse scalpels - they dull incredibly fast.  Same goes for oscillating saw blades and drill bits - it has been known since the beginnings of the AO foundation in the late 1950's that using dull drill bits results in plunging through the far surface of bone - [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22391404/) is a recent study in a very highly regarded orthopaedic trauma journal showing that using a dull drill bit can result in plunging nearly four times as deep as using a sharp one.  That's the difference between an uneventful fixation of a clavicle and a punctured subclavian artery and pneumothorax requiring vascular surgery and a lengthy ICU stay.  

Scissors on the other hand are by their very nature used in a very controlled fashion and are more often used to dissect by opening the blades rather than to cut by closing them.  Comparing scissors to drill bits is like asking why you need to wear a seatbelt in your car when you don't have to wear one while sitting in your couch at home."

Also, the ""advice"" that floats around. ""Get a job that makes you happy."" If a person can't get a job they enjoy doing why exactly are they working? Just for a paycheck so they can pay for necessities and materialistic temporary pleasures? Is that the purpose of life? Do kids think about why it is jobs are important? All these questions and I doubt its easy for kids to find an answer, cause they lack life experience.

Sounds like they tried to eliminate most of lifestyle factors. Naturally, you can never be completely certain, but since it wasn't just a binary classification (goes to sauna or doesn't go to sauna) but instead a continuum (goes to sauna x times a week), I'd say it seems like it might not be just blind correlation.

Edit: they also point out a plausible mechanism:

An Updated Analysis of Direct-to-Consumer Television Advertisements for Prescription Drugs

Annals of Family Medicine - May/June 2018 16:211-216;

Abstract

PURPOSE In 2015, the American Medical Association called for a ban of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) for prescription drugs. Yet, the pharmaceutical industry spends more than ever on broadcast advertisements, with national health care costs largely driven by drug spending. An evaluation of these ads is critical, as these advertisements can impact the frequency which patients ask their doctors about medications.

METHODS A content analysis of prime-time direct-to-consumer ads was conducted across 4 major cable television networks. The ad content (n = 61) was coded for factual claims made regarding target conditions, appeals used, portrayal of medications, and lifestyle characteristics shown.

RESULTS We found a substantial decrease in the percentage of ads that conveyed information about the conditions being targeted, such as risk factors (16%) and prevalence (16%). Positive emotional appeals (94%) continued to be emphasized; yet there was decreased use of negative emotional appeals (51%), pointing to an overall more positive portrayal of a patient’s experience with a medication. The lifestyles portrayed in the sample largely featured how products can enable more recreational activities (69%) and fewer ads (7%) presented alternatives to product use.

CONCLUSIONS Direct-to-consumer advertising continued to promote prescription drugs above educating the population. Improvement in the educational value of DTCA is likely to require regulatory action rather than reliance on self-regulation by the pharmaceutical industry.

Health,"Pthlalates? Oh fuck yes they are. And a truck load others.

Perhaps the most widespread group of toxic chemicals found in our environment. Phthalates are commonly found in after shave lotions, aspirin, cosmetics, detergents, foods microwaved with plastic covers, oral pharmaceutical drugs, intravenous products prepared in plastic bags, hair sprays, insecticides, insect repellents, nail polish, nail polish remover, skin care products, adhesives, explosives, lacquer, janitorial products, perfumes, paper coatings, printing inks, safety glass, and varnishes. Phthalates have been implicated in reproductive damage, depressed leukocyte function, and cancer. Phthalates have also been found to impede blood coagulation, lower testosterone, and alter sexual development in children. Low levels of phthalates can feminize the male brain of the fetus, while high levels can hyper-masculinize the developing male brain.



Vinyl chloride is an intermediate in the synthesis of several commercial chemicals, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Exposure to vinyl chloride may cause central nervous system depression, nausea, headache, dizziness, liver damage, degenerative bone changes, thrombocytopenia, enlargement of the spleen, and death.



Benzene is an organic solvent that is widespread in the environment. Benzene is a by-product of all sources of combustion, including cigarette smoke, and is released by outgassing from synthetic materials, and is a pollutant released by numerous industrial processes. Benzene is an extremely toxic chemical that is mutagenic and carcinogenic. High exposures to benzene cause symptoms of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lack of coordination, central nervous system depression, and death. It can also cause hematological abnormalities.



Pyrethrins are widely used as insecticides. Exposure during pregnancy doubles the likelihood of autism. Pyrethrins may affect neurological development, disrupt hormones, induce cancer, and suppress the immune system.



Xylenes (dimethylbenzenes) are solvents found not only in common products such as paints, lacquers, pesticides, cleaning fluids, fuel and exhaust fumes, but also in perfumes and insect repellents. Xylenes are oxidized in the liver and bound to glycine before eliminated in urine. High xylene levels may be due to the use of certain perfumes and insect repellents. High exposures to xylene create an increase in oxidative stress, causing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, central nervous system depression, and death. Occupational exposure is often found in pathology laboratories where xylene is used for tissue processing.


Styrene is used in the manufacturing of plastics, in building materials, and is found in car exhaust fumes. Polystyrene and its copolymers are widely used as food-packaging materials. The ability of styrene monomer to leach from polystyrene packaging to food has been reported. Occupational exposure due to inhalation of large amounts of styrene adversely impacts the central nervous system, causes concentration problems, muscle weakness, tiredness and nausea, and irritates the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and throat.


Organophosphates are one of the most toxic groups of substances used throughout the world. They are often used as biochemical weapons and terrorist agents, but are most commonly used in pesticide formulations. Organophospates are inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes, leading to overstimulation of nerve cells, causing sweating, salivation, diarrhea, abnormal behavior, including aggression and depression. Children exposed to organophosphates have more than twice the risk of developing pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), an autism spectrum disorder. A study done in the San Francisco Bay area found that in California agricultural areas, children born to mothers living within 500 meters of fields where organochlorine pesticides were used were more than 6 times more likely to develop autism than children whose mothers did not live near such fields. ASD risk increased with the poundage of organochlorines applied and decreased with distance from field sites. Maternal organophosphate exposure has been associated with various adverse outcomes including having shorter pregnancies and children with impaired reflexes.

MTBE and ETBE are gasoline additives used to improve octane ratings. Exposure to these compounds is most likely due to groundwater contamination, and inhalation or skin exposure to gasoline or its vapors and exhaust fumes. MTBE has been demonstrated to cause hepatic, kidney, and central nervous system toxicity, peripheral neurotoxicity, and cancer in animals. Since the metabolites of these compounds are the same, ETBE may be similarly toxic.

2, 4-Dicholorophenoxyacetic (2,4-D) is very common herbicide that was a part of Agent Orange, used by the United States during the Vietnam War to increase visibility for war planes, by destroying plant undergrowth and crops. It is most commonly used in agriculture on genetically modified foods, and as a weed killer for lawns. Exposure to 2, 4-D via skin or oral ingestion is associated with neuritis, weakness, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy, stupor, seizures, brain damage, and impaired reflexes. 2, 4-D is a known endocrine disruptor, and can block hormone distribution and cause glandular breakdown.

Diphenyl Phosphate is a metabolite of the organophosphate flame retardant triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), which is used in plastics, electronic equipment, nail polish, and resins.  TPHP can cause endocrine disruption.  Studies have also linked TPHP to reproductive and developmental problems. 

Acrylamide can polymerize to form polyacrylamide.  Polyacrylamide is used in many industrial processes such as plastics, food packaging, cosmetics, nail polish, dyes, and treatment of drinking water.  Food and cigarette smoke are also two major sources of exposure.  Acrylamide has been found in foods like potato chips, French fries, and many others such as asparagus, potatoes, legumes, nuts, seeds, beef, eggs, and fish.  Asparagine, which is found in these foods can produce acrylamide when cooked at high temperature in the presence of sugars.  High levels of acrylamide can elevate a patient’s risk of cancer.  In addition, acrylamide is known to cause neurological damage.

Perchlorate is used in the production of rocket fuel, missiles, fireworks, flares, explosives, fertilizers, and bleach.  Studies show that perchlorate is often found in water supplies.  Many food sources are also contaminated with perchlorate.  Perchlorate can disrupt the thyroid’s ability to produce hormones.  The EPA has also labeled perchlorate a likely human carcinogen.  Patients that are high in perchlorate can use a reverse osmosis water treatment system to remove the chemical from their water supply.

1,3 Butadiene is a chemical made from the processing of petroleum.  It is often a colorless gas with a mild gasoline-like odor.  Most of this chemical is used in the production of synthetic rubber.  1,3 Butadiene is a known carcinogen and has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Individuals that come into contact with rubber, such as car tires, could absorb 1,3 Butadiene through the skin.  The increased use of old tires in the production of crumb rubber playgrounds and athletic fields is quite troubling because children and athletes may be exposed to toxic chemicals this way.

Propylene Oxide is used in the production of plastics and is used as a fumigant.   Propylene oxide is used to make polyester resins for textile and construction industries.  It is also used in the preparation of lubricants, surfactants, and oil demulsifiers.  It has also been used as a food additive, an herbicide, a microbicide, an insecticide, a fungicide, and a miticide.  Propylene oxide is a probable human carcinogen. 


1-Bromopropane is an organic solvent used for metal cleaning, foam gluing, and dry cleaning.  Studies have shown that 1-BP is a neurotoxin as well as a reproductive toxin.  Research indicates that exposure to 1-BP can cause sensory and motor deficits.  Chronic exposure can lead to decreased cognitive function and impairment of the central nervous system.  Acute exposure can lead to headaches.


Ethylene oxide is used in many different industries including agrochemicals detergents, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products.  Ethylene oxide is also used as a sterilizing agent on rubber, plastics, and electronics.  Chronic exposure to ethylene oxide has been determined to be mutagenic to humans.  Multiple agencies have reported it as a carcinogen.  Studies of people exposed to ethylene oxide show an increased incidence of breast cancer and leukemia.  Caution is needed with ethylene oxide because it is odorless at toxic levels.


Acrylonitrile is a colorless liquid with a pungent odor.  It is used in the production of acrylic fibers, resins, and rubber.  Use of any of these products could lead to exposure to acrylonitrile.  Smoking tobacco and cigarettes is another potential exposure.  Exposure to acrylonitrile can lead to headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and chest pains.  The European Union has classified acrylonitrile as a carcinogen.

Health,"Ok I’ll try to answer, but you should really look this up as there’s ton of information debunking the myth anti-Vaxxers perpetuate.

The extra « junk » those people refer to is typically formaldehyde, aluminium and mercury.  Said like this it sounds terrible right?  

Regarding formaldehyde, your body naturally makes it in greater quantity than what you would receive from a shot.  A cigarette also would give off more formaldehyde than a shot of vaccin as well, it’s really negligible

Mercury, well this one is actually thimesoral and has been pretty much removed from vaccins and no correlation was shown between that and autism.  In fact autism rates went up while the usage of thimesoral disappeared.  So anti-vaxxers moved on to aluminium and so shall we.

Aluminium is actually one of the most common element in nature.  An anti-acid tablet contains many time the dose of Aluminium than vaccine do, it's really a negligible amount compared to the doses we end up getting every day from other sources.  Basically, the molecule helps increase the antibody response to the vaccin, which allows **smaller doses to be much more effective**, cool huh!

Lastly, it's not straight up aluminium and mercury that is present in vaccine, they re molecules which are harmless to our bodies.  Think of sodium and chlorine which are highly poisonous and can kill you very fast!  Well when you combine both, you get sodium chloride or NaCl which is table salt and absolutely necessary for our bodies.

But 75% of people misusing opioids weren’t prescribed the meds (NSDUH). They were friends or family of patients who stole or were sold the drugs. Generally they had past experiences with other drugs like cocaine and heroin. Is that the doctors fault?  Is that the pharma company’s fault?

There are 100 million people in America alone suffering from chronic pain (Institute of Medicine report from 2011).  Yes they should have other options but you’re in an administration that is wiping out funding for those treatments. Depriving these folks of their lifeline because yes these tools of medicine were abused is just leading to worse outcomes. Deaths are rising not from prescription drugs but from heroin and fentanyl obtained by pain patients who need alternatives because their doctor won’t even prescribe them methadone or buprenorphine. 

Treating Pharma companies or these drugs as some big boogie man isn’t productive.

That could mean a new car (in terms of extra car payments), a much needed home repair, or a much needed vacation for someone. Either way, its more money in the pockets of the people. To your point of getting that extra money in returns anyways, the tax rates are much lower now as well, so we would actually NOT have the same amount of money in our pockets at the end of the year (or rather, after the returns).

Abstract

Rationale

Depressed patients robustly exhibit affective biases in emotional processing which are altered by SSRIs and predict clinical outcome.

Objectives

The objective of this study is to investigate whether psilocybin, recently shown to rapidly improve mood in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), alters patients’ emotional processing biases.

Methods

Seventeen patients with treatment-resistant depression completed a dynamic emotional face recognition task at baseline and 1 month later after two doses of psilocybin with psychological support. Sixteen controls completed the emotional recognition task over the same time frame but did not receive psilocybin.

Results

We found evidence for a group × time interaction on speed of emotion recognition (p = .035). At baseline, patients were slower at recognising facial emotions compared with controls (p &lt; .001). After psilocybin, this difference was remediated (p = .208). Emotion recognition was faster at follow-up compared with baseline in patients (p = .004, d = .876) but not controls (p = .263, d = .302). In patients, this change was significantly correlated with a reduction in anhedonia over the same time period (r = .640, p = .010).

Conclusions

Psilocybin with psychological support appears to improve processing of emotional faces in treatment-resistant depression, and this correlates with reduced anhedonia. Placebo-controlled studies are warranted to follow up these preliminary findings."

&gt; ""We had this overriding hypothesis that there must be something odd about the metabolism of obese people,"" Prentice says. ""And the world was spending hundreds of millions of dollars doing very detailed and complicated experiments trying to track down these defects.""
Prentice says this belief was founded through studies of obese people, whose bodies simply should not have been able to generate such enormous bulk from the the amount of food they said they were eating. What he now calls ""my greatest scientific achievement"", with his tongue only partly in his cheek, was discovering that it wasn't the metabolism of the obese people that was at fault, but their memories.
""In a very short space of time it became blindingly obvious that obese people must in real life be eating a lot more than they ever admitted to scientists,"" Prentice says.

&gt; Adolescents who view more advertising for medical marijuana are more likely to use marijuana, express intentions to use the drug and have more-positive expectations about the substance, according to a new RAND Corporation study.

Planting the seed for marijuana use: Changes in exposure to medical marijuana advertising and subsequent adolescent marijuana use, cognitions, and consequences over seven years. 

Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 2018; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.03.031

Link: https://www.drugandalcoholdependence.com/article/S0376-8716(18)30231-X/fulltext

Abstract:

Highlights

•Many adolescents are exposed to medical marijuana (MM) advertising.
•MM advertising exposure may contribute to increased marijuana use and consequences.
•Regulations for marijuana advertising are needed, similar to tobacco and alcohol.

Background

Marijuana use during adolescence is associated with neurocognitive deficits and poorer functioning across several domains. It is likely that more states will pass both medical and recreational marijuana legalization laws in the coming elections; therefore, we must begin to look more closely at the longitudinal effects of medical marijuana (MM) advertising on marijuana use among adolescents so that we can better understand effects that this advertising may have on their subsequent marijuana use and related outcomes.

Methods

We followed two cohorts of 7th and 8th graders (mean age 13) recruited from school districts in Southern California from 2010 until 2017 (mean age 19) to examine effects of MM advertising on adolescents’ marijuana use, cognitions, and consequences over seven years. Latent growth models examined trajectories of self-reported exposure to medical marijuana ads in the past three months and trajectories of use, cognitions, and consequences.

Results

Higher average exposure to MM advertising was associated with higher average use, intentions to use, positive expectancies, and negative consequences. Similarly, higher rates of change in MM advertising exposure were associated with higher rates of change in use, intentions, expectancies, and consequences over seven years.

Conclusions

Results suggest that exposure to MM advertising may not only play a significant role in shaping attitudes about marijuana, but may also contribute to increased marijuana use and related negative consequences throughout adolescence. This highlights the importance of considering regulations for marijuana advertising, similar to regulations in place for the promotion of tobacco and alcohol in the U.S.

Health,"The sheer volume of stupid/not serious complaints people lodge in any ER, GP clinic or urgent care clinic, every single day, is insane. Headaches do not warrant MRIs. I bet 50% of the population get regular headaches, unfortunately probably 80% of these patients are women. Not because they whine too much or are weak, or whatever reactionary phrasing you want to use to describe it, but because they frankly are just more prone to headaches. It's not feasible to MRI every headache, nor would it be beneficial to society. Now, I have no idea what her symptoms were outside of headaches and neither does the person writing this likely, but if someone came to see me and their only complaint was headaches and nothing else, she or he would not get an MRI.

I'm sorry to say this, but this woman sounds like she just got unlucky. If as a society we want to move away from people being under treated for potentially serious, yet benign sounding complaints then we need to train more physicians to deal with the ever increasing volume, lose 60lbs, stop guzzling soft drinks, kick the opiate obsession, incentivize physicians to properly take care of our poor and get them out of our ERs and finally put the responsibility of ""your"" health back in ""your"" hands (hey maybe we should lose weight and exercise instead of getting bilateral knee replacements) "

&gt; HKU AIDS Institute Invents Universal Antibody Drug for HIV-1 Prevention and Immunotherapy


&gt; A research team led by scientists at AIDS Institute and Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine of The University of Hong Kong (HKU) invents a universal antibody drug against HIV/AIDS. By engineering a tandem bi-specific broadly neutralizing antibody, the team found that this novel antibody drug is universally effective not only against all genetically divergent global HIV-1 strains tested but also promoting the elimination of latently infected cells in a humanized mouse model.

Tandem bispecific neutralizing antibody eliminates HIV-1 infection in humanized mice.

Abstract

The discovery of an HIV-1 cure remains a medical challenge because the virus rebounds quickly after the cessation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Here, we investigate the potential of an engineered tandem bispecific broadly neutralizing antibody (bs-bnAb) as an innovative product for HIV-1 prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. We discovered that by preserving 2 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) binding domains of each parental bnAb, a single gene–encoded tandem bs-bnAb, BiIA-SG, displayed substantially improved breadth and potency. BiIA-SG neutralized all 124 HIV-1–pseudotyped viruses tested, including global subtypes/recombinant forms, transmitted/founder viruses, variants not susceptible to parental bnAbs and to many other bnAbs with an average IC50 value of 0.073 μg/ml (range &lt; 0.001–1.03 μg/ml). In humanized mice, an injection of BiIA-SG conferred sterile protection when administered prior to challenges with diverse live HIV-1 stains. Moreover, whereas BiIA-SG delayed viral rebound in a short-term therapeutic setting when combined with cART, a single injection of adeno-associated virus–transferred (AAV-transferred) BiIA-SG gene resulted dose-dependently in prolonged in vivo expression of BiIA-SG, which was associated with complete viremia control and subsequent elimination of infected cells in humanized mice. These results warrant the clinical development of BiIA-SG as a promising bs-bnAb–based biomedical intervention for the prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection."

Its not a cabinet position and it is for a term of 2 years. I seriously doubt if Dr. Oz will have the ONLY say (he will have A say) in what the council offers as recommendations to the President and his cabinet. Not only that, President Trump has proved to us several times just within the last year that if he feels someone is incompetent or a bad fit for a position, he will not hesitate to fire them. Dr. Oz will be in no position to shove down his alternate remedies down anyone's throats, if that is really what you are concerned about.

Abstract

Background

Some country guidelines recommend that people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) limit their consumption of eggs and cholesterol. Our previously published 3-mo weight-maintenance study showed that a high-egg (≥12 eggs/wk) diet compared with a low-egg diet (&lt;2 eggs/wk) did not have adverse effects on cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with T2D.

Objective

The current study follows the previously published 3-mo weight-maintenance study and assessed the effects of the high-egg compared with the low-egg diets as part of a 3-mo weight-loss period, followed by a 6-mo follow-up period for a total duration of 12 mo.

Design

Participants with prediabetes or T2D (n = 128) were prescribed a 3-mo daily energy restriction of 2.1 MJ and a macronutrient-matched diet and instructed on specific types and quantities of foods to be consumed, with an emphasis on replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Participants were followed up at the 9- and 12-mo visits.

Results

From 3 to 12 mo the weight loss was similar (high-egg compared with low-egg diets: −3.1 ± 6.3 compared with −3.1 ± 5.2 kg; P = 0.48). There were no differences between groups in glycemia (plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, 1,5-anhydroglucitol), traditional serum lipids, markers of inflammation [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, soluble E-selectin (sE-Selectin)], oxidative stress (F2-isoprostanes), or adiponectin from 3 to 12 mo or from 0 to 12 mo.

Conclusions

People with prediabetes or T2D who consumed a 3-mo high-egg weight-loss diet with a 6-mo follow-up exhibited no adverse changes in cardiometabolic markers compared with those who consumed a low-egg weight-loss diet. A healthy diet based on population guidelines and including more eggs than currently recommended by some countries may be safely consumed. This trial is registered at http://www.anzctr.org.au/ as ACTRN12612001266853."

Nobody is asking anyone for a number of calories. I am not ignoring anything, simply not commenting on stuff which is not remotely relevant to the point. Here is the UK Office For National Statistics spelling it out in February of this year.
&gt;The average reporting error across all adults in the sample was found to be 32.0%. The minimum was negative 16.5% (over-reported) and the maximum was 72.2% (under-reported). Absolute differences between self-reported estimates and DLW measures ranged from 598 to 3,671 calories. Self-reported intake, weight, age and gender were all significantly associated with reporting error. The (baseline) implausibility rate was 34.4%. Adjusted energy intake estimates produced an implausibility rate of 1.1%. The results suggest that this methodology offers an improvement to the accuracy of population level estimates by adjusting self-reported calorie intake data using factors predicted from DLW data.

Health,"&gt; Sorry but free will has nothing to do with religion.

It does in the sense that there's no evidence for either one. (It's also humorous that so-called skeptics mock theists for clinging to the god delusion, but can't let go of their free will delusion.) 

&gt; Many scientists have been working on the problem of free will and consciousness, and it’s silly to think its unfalsifiable.

Well, hey... maybe somebody will prove it (or disprove it) one day. But for now, just like with religion, I see no reason to take it as the default position. 

&gt; If you know anything about quantum mechanics, you’ll understand that the world is not straightforwardly deterministic.

Do you have any evidence to suggest that quantum waves affect brain activity? And if you do, do you have any evidence to suggest we can directly manipulate these quantum waves? And if not, whether your decisions are based on a prior cause or a cosmic coin flip, where is there room for free will in this equation?

&gt; And even if you believe in hard determinism, doesn’t mean free will can’t exist alongside it.

Sure it does, unless you're talking about the compatibilist half-assed free will definition of 'doing something not under duress'. 

&gt; You say I have zero control over my thoughts and action; this is just not true. We all have the ability to choose, and choice is something that exists even with determinism.

In this case, your use of 'choice' is simply your brain running an algorithm and coming up with a pre-determined solution, and even computers can do that. It's like Google Maps 'choosing' the fastest route for you when you ask for directions. 

(Edit: To make this concept easier to grasp, consider yourself as consciousness observing reality through a body and a brain that you do not have direct control over.)

Unless you want to make a claim of a spirit or soul, there's no 'wizard of oz' in your head that can override whatever solution your brain reaches.

&gt; There are trillions of actions we have taken that could have been chosen otherwise unimpeded.

Actually, no. There is one, and ONLY one thing you could've done at any given time. (Unless you have an example of somebody doing two different things at once that would be physically impossible for one person to do simultaneously.)

&gt; Determinism is not an excuse to do whatever you want and declare you had no moral responsibility.

LOL, if I could do what I wanted, we wouldn't be having this conversation, would we? And for what it's worth, just like free will, I think morality is a concept that has outlived its usefulness, and needs to go."
Health,"&gt; 96% of heart attacks in women can be prevented

Now really, do you honestly believe that kind of statistic?  What could possibly be the preventive strategy ... stop smoking, exercise, diet, get rid of fluoride in the water???   On the basis of that bit of ""news"", have you come to believe that physicians can prevent 96% of heart attacks in women, or that women can take steps to reduce their lifetime risk of heart by 96%?   What are physicians / researchers / government officials to do when women can do something to reduce their risk, but don't?  Blame the medical establishment!  The real problem here is that this kind of statistic is merely headline clickbait, and has no basis in reality.  

&gt; The issue is that they wait until people are near death to do anything

Who is the ""they"" you are talking about?   And what exactly do you expect me to do when people don't take my advice?  

&gt; I mean funding. Look what we fund. We pay for treatment of disease, disease management, we rarely fund preventative measures. 

What are you writing about?  Do you have any perspective on funding for medical research?  When you consider the immense effort we devote to developing vaccines to prevent infection and now even cancer, you just can't argue that with any credibility.   Even most of the antibiotics prescribed nowadays are to prevent disease, not treat it.  For example, most people don't even realize that we give people penicillin for strep throat not as a remedy for strep throat, but to prevent rheumatic fever!"

People run red lights and hit healthy and sick people. People get the flu. They get glaucoma. They begin early onset Alzheimer's. They cut their feet at the shore. They get shot at high school by incel libertarians. None of these things are foreseeable or preventable. The mandate is not an entitlement it is an assurance that healthcare is being funded by the citizens equally. You sound like one of those idiots that fights seatbelt laws or smoking restrictions. I've been lucky to have never needed any sort of entitlement and I've been proud to live in a country that provides them. Try that for once. Try being proud that we provide for those less fortunate instead.

Health,"As someone who cut out all sugars and carbs from his life, I can confidently say that sugar, and carbs as well, are indeed incredibly addictive and harmful drugs.

They trigger compulsive consumption, just like cocaine. They trigger highs and lows, just like cocaine. When you get hungry every two or three hours, you have a problem. One spoon of sugar is too much and a thousand is not enough. 

They cause physical withdrawal. We call it ""keto flu"", but it is a misnomer. Your body (especially your kidneys and brain) developed a dependence, and now they try to restore normal function. It lasts for a week or two, just like heroine withdrawal. In some aspects it takes months, and some damage never ever heals.

They cause mental withdrawal as well. You have regular carb dreams. You make up the flimsiest excuses to continue consumption. You believe you have a need for them, and your health will suffer without them. You fear that abstinence will kill you. You think abstinence is difficult, but it is not. You do not need them at all.

You try to find replacements. Natural sweeteners, artificial sweeteners, fake breads, almond flour, cauliflower rice, etc. This might be familiar from opioid replacement therapy where they try to replace heroin with methadone or buprenorphine.

They cause more serious and widespread health issues than any other drug. Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer (brain, pancreatic, breast, prostate, colon, etc), fatty liver, gallstones, dental plaques, pancreatitis, bipolar disorder, hypertension, COPD, Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, Multiple Sclerosis... Shall I continue? Krokodile is smalltime compared to the rotting limbs you get from diabetes.

You live in a community of addicts. Sugar and carbs are the elephant in the room. Everyone denies they have a problem, including you. They blame everything else instead: Sodium, cholesterol, fat, saturated fat, protein, animal products, sedentary behavior, laziness, lack of exercise, whatever scapegoat is popular at the moment. When you abstain, they will try to get you hooked again, with the flimsiest excuses I have mentioned. Ever tried to abstain from alcohol, only for others to drag you back by claiming health benefits?

There is an entire dealer network specifically to get everyone hooked and dependent. They acquired government subsidies to ensure a cheap and low quality supply. They refined their products to be as addictive as possible. They spend disgusting amounts of money to advertise to the most vulnerable. They corrupt science, governments, enforcement organizations, dietitians, medicine to promote their drug and hide their true nature. They do everything in their power to keep up the status quo.

After you abstain for long enough, you realize they do not even have a good taste. They have sickly chemical taste, completely different from what you have remembered. It was all in your head, it was the addiction that told you this stuff is good. You regret ever touching the stuff again.

Just like the article says, you reach a state of clarity, you can no longer understand why you even started with the stuff, and you can not imagine ever doing it again. I know I will never will. My myopia, my stretch marks from my past obesity, and memories of my lost years, insomnia, cognitive issues, and a gallstone are all reminders of what are the costs of this kind of drug use. I was lucky that I have realized what was going on, it could have been worse, much worse.

Health,"Scientific article title: Parenting and Salience Network Connectivity Among African Americans: A Protective Pathway for Health-Risk Behaviors

Abstract:
Background
Supportive parenting during childhood has been associated with many positive developmental outcomes for offspring in adulthood, including fewer health-risk behaviors. Little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these associations.

Methods
The present study followed rural African Americans (n = 91, 52% female) from late childhood (11–13 years of age) to emerging adulthood (25 years of age). Parent–child communication was assessed at 11, 12, and 13 years of age. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used at 25 years of age to measure resting-state functional connectivity of the anterior salience network (ASN). Harmful alcohol use and emotional eating were also assessed at 25 years of age. Structural equation modeling was used to test pathways from parent–child communication at 11 to 13 years of age to harmful alcohol use and emotional eating at 25 years of age via resting-state functional connectivity of the ASN.

Results
Greater parent–child communication between 11 and 13 years of age forecast greater resting-state functional connectivity of the ASN at 25 years of age which, in turn, was associated with lower harmful alcohol use and emotional eating at 25 years of age. Significant indirect effects through the ASN were present for both outcomes.

Conclusions
These findings indicate the importance of parenting in late childhood for adaptive behaviors and suggest a pathway via higher ASN coherence. This network was implicated in both harmful alcohol use and emotional eating, corroborating evidence of overlap in brain regions for dysregulated substance use and eating behaviors and revealing divergent pathways. These findings support the value of prevention and intervention efforts targeting parenting skills in childhood toward fostering long-term, adaptive neurocognitive development.

I mean, the Center for Food Safety is an organization funded by the [organic lobby](https://www.activistfacts.com/organizations/11-center-for-food-safety/), and it's the organic lobby that pushed for these nonsensical labels so that they can use their propaganda to slander GMOs, allowing them to get the advantage over biotech foods.

I understand that people can buy illicit drugs through the black market, but legalizing the drugs will cause the number of users to skyrocket. The majority of people who do not use illegal drugs, do not use them because they are dangerous or illegal.

Ive meet a lot of PTs in my time treating patients and most of them are approaching rehab with a single joint centric approach and not a big picture scale. 

Most PTs are stuck treating one or 2 areas and not the full spectrum of a movement dysfunction. When you get injured you need to carve out the root problem and replace it with a correct movement pattern, not just perform back extensions or some old school protocol...

Health,"“Hijack a child’s brain” is obviously an exaggeration but I think we should be putting warning labels on all this junk food. Kids brains are barely developed they don’t understand what the products are their brains just process how they feel after eating it and usually, it feels amazing for them! In the netflix documentary “The magic pill” there’s a young autistic girl maybe 4 years old and they show footage of her parents feeding her mostly chicken nuggets, doritos and goldfish crackers. The documentary is about the ketogenic diet so they showed footage of the parents trying to feed the girl vegetables and actual food and she was throwing tantrums outright rejecting the food. This is what happens when garbage is being fed to young children without any restrictions. I think people should be free to make choices for themselves but I also think It’s unfair that most people don’t realize the things they are feeding their children or themselves can lead to chronic disease. The time is long overdue, we need warning labels on junk food just like cigarettes - there needs to be a gruesome photo showing what can happen if you eat too much of the food, a big warning stating that the package contains no (or barely any) nutritional value and marketing for these products should be stopped. Why should cigarette companies not be allowed to market their products while Coca Cola can encourage people to drink their unhealthy syrup cocktail that leads to health problems? It’s completely unfair and shit needs to change, the top killers of people are diet related so why haven’t we done anything about it like we did with cigarettes?"

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Cannabidiol has been used for treatment-resistant seizures in patients with severe early-onset epilepsy. We investigated the efficacy and safety of cannabidiol added to a regimen of conventional antiepileptic medication to treat drop seizures in patients with the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, a severe developmental epileptic encephalopathy.

METHODS

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 30 clinical centers, we randomly assigned patients with the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (age range, 2 to 55 years) who had had two or more drop seizures per week during a 28-day baseline period to receive cannabidiol oral solution at a dose of either 20 mg per kilogram of body weight (20-mg cannabidiol group) or 10 mg per kilogram (10-mg cannabidiol group) or matching placebo, administered in two equally divided doses daily for 14 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage change from baseline in the frequency of drop seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period.

RESULTS

A total of 225 patients were enrolled; 76 patients were assigned to the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 73 to the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 76 to the placebo group. During the 28-day baseline period, the median number of drop seizures was 85 in all trial groups combined. The median percent reduction from baseline in drop-seizure frequency during the treatment period was 41.9% in the 20-mg cannabidiol group, 37.2% in the 10-mg cannabidiol group, and 17.2% in the placebo group (P=0.005 for the 20-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group, and P=0.002 for the 10-mg cannabidiol group vs. placebo group). The most common adverse events among the patients in the cannabidiol groups were somnolence, decreased appetite, and diarrhea; these events occurred more frequently in the higher-dose group. Six patients in the 20-mg cannabidiol group and 1 patient in the 10-mg cannabidiol group discontinued the trial medication because of adverse events and were withdrawn from the trial. Fourteen patients who received cannabidiol (9%) had elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations.

CONCLUSIONS

Among children and adults with the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, the addition of cannabidiol at a dose of 10 mg or 20 mg per kilogram per day to a conventional antiepileptic regimen resulted in greater reductions in the frequency of drop seizures than placebo. Adverse events with cannabidiol included elevated liver aminotransferase concentrations. "

Abstract

Retail atmospherics is becoming an increasingly important strategic tool for stores and restaurants. Ambient music and background noise are especially important atmospheric elements given their ubiquity in retail settings. However, there is high variation in the volume of ambient music and background noise, with some stores/restaurants having very loud ambience and others having very quiet ambience. Given the variation in loudness levels at stores/restaurants, and the managerial ease of adjusting volume level, we investigate the consequences of ambient music (and background noise) volume on food choices and sales. A pilot study, two field experiments, and five lab studies show that low (vs. high or no) volume music/noise leads to increased sales of healthy foods due to induced relaxation. In contrast, high volume music/noise tends to enhance excitement levels, which in turn leads to unhealthy food choices.

There are also genetic predispositions to becoming obese, but it doesn’t account for the rising rates as we see it. It’s more of habit and role modeling (as described in the link below).

&gt;In fact, a yet-to-be-published study that found no link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, may have changed IARC’s 2015 analysis of the herbicide had it been published.

&gt;Aaron Blair, an emeritus scientist at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, who contributed to the unpublished study and led IARC’s review of glyphosate, said the study “would have made it less likely that glyphosate would meet the agency’s criteria for being classed as ‘probably carcinogenic,’” reported Reuters in June 2017.

&gt; ...

&gt;The European Chemicals Agency, for example, concluded in March 2017 that “the available scientific evidence did not meet the criteria to classify glyphosate as a carcinogen.” This assessment, like IARC’s, looked for any potential cancer hazard glyphosate may pose to humans at any dose, not the actual cancer risk it poses at a specific dose.

Health,"I could potentially see people using amphetamines, cocaine, LSD, Shrooms, heroin, and other dissociatives as long as they're micro dosing and use the drugs under a doctors order. However, most of us have no self-control and these drugs play on that human vulnerability. I think it would be easy to misuse these substances leading to negative health effects. Albeit shrooms and marijuana are different. Maybe those should be legal? Not really sure. I've also heard that ketamine is good for depression but can also lead to addiction. And obviously, if you did a lot of cocaine and amphetamines you would look like a paranoid schizophrenic having auditory/visual/tactile hallucinations, and delusions plus other problems with the heart and other vital organs. So I'm not really sure. I think more research needs to be done on these drugs before releasing them into society. "

I am glossing over the problems with adolescent brain damage for one reason, it would be idiotic to legalize marijuana for people under 21. Marijuana should fall into the same basic rule set as alcohol, regulated by age and heavily taxed. I would be totally happy to see a box of joints sold right next to a box of cigarettes at the gas station, the same one that can also sell you a 6 pack of beer.

Whether this is true or not, this is their perception after years and years of gun control threats. People don't trust the government, it's nothing new by any stretch of imagination. People were paranoid in the '70s even.

I think if we wish to make a dent in this perception, the most effective method would be with honey, not vinegar. To persuade people that you're NOT trying to take their guns, and rather explain in however much detail as is necessary that you only wish to restrict them to certain dangerous individuals. The whole ""you're a piece of shit because you don't want more gun control"" is about as effective as ""you're a piece of shit because you DO want gun control""."

Honey collection has been depicted in cave paintings that are 8000 years old. We do it, and many other animals do it too.

Health,"Per the first link

&gt; Research shows an alkaline state is healthier for your body, and most tissues and cells maintain an alkaline pH balance.(8) Sugar does the opposite: It imbalances pH and makes you more acidic, increasing your risk for numerous problems including kidney stones, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress.

The benefits of an ""alkaline diet"" (if you go follow 8) say nothing about the harm of sugar or the effects of sugar on blood pH.  An ""alkaline"" diet changes lots of things, but it's not focused on blood pH.  It's testing swapping out a processed food diet for largely a whole foods vegan one.  Yeah, that's probably better, but are you sure that's really the acidity in the diet that's the problem?  Coffee is the major antioxidant in the diet of most people in many western countries and it's very acidic and is widely considered to be healthy.   Lemons are acidic and yet they're considered alkaline?  It's nonsense.

You can eat baking soda and sugar and you'll have alkaline urine (and people are experimenting with that).  Also, if you eat a high meat diet and low fiber, you'll have an alkaline colon, but acidic urine.  On a no meat, high fiber diet (so the alkaline diet), you'll have alkaline urine, but an acidic colon.  Neither will change blood pH because blood pH is regulated by breathing.  Carbon dioxide dissolves in water and forms bicarbonate to neutralize acid.  Literally you can just breathe more to make your blood alkaline, but food will not do it.  You can actually do it very quickly by hyperventilating.

Blood pH becomes acidic when you go into ketoacidosis, which happens when you're diabetic and you're not managing your disease.  That damages every organ of the body, including the kidneys.

Health,"I've yet to see anything that contradicts the clear evidence that I have posted that the obesity problem can be explained simply by people over eating and the refusal to accept this is caused by under-reporting.
Here is what Andrew Prentice, a highly distinguished obesity researcher says 
&gt; ""We had this overriding hypothesis that there must be something odd about the metabolism of obese people,"" Prentice says. ""And the world was spending hundreds of millions of dollars doing very detailed and complicated experiments trying to track down these defects.""
Prentice says this belief was founded through studies of obese people, whose bodies simply should not have been able to generate such enormous bulk from the the amount of food they said they were eating. What he now calls ""my greatest scientific achievement"", with his tongue only partly in his cheek, was discovering that it wasn't the metabolism of the obese people that was at fault, but their memories.
""In a very short space of time it became blindingly obvious that obese people must in real life be eating a lot more than they ever admitted to scientists,"" Prentice says. ""That completely removed the rationale for the initial hypothesis on which we were spending hundreds of millions of dollars.""
He is careful to say that the people were not lying: ""I think that obese people subconsciously mislead themselves about what they eat and then pass that on either consciously or subconsciously to scientific investigators trying to measure it.""

The main types are:

* Basic sauna [this can have an electric or a wood-burning stove]

This is what the vast majority of saunas in the world are, and can be warm or hot, dry or humid. The gym saunas you can find in most hotels and gyms e.g. in the US are mildly warmed saunas where water is for some strange reason forbidden. The usual distinction of wet or dry sauna is merely the difference of throwing water on the rocks or not throwing. The sauna itself is the same. 

* Steam/Turkish sauna

I don't have a lot of experiences of these other than that almost all Finnish swimming halls have these in addition to normal saunas. I've never seen one in a private residence, though. They are usually mild in temperature and have extremely thick water steam/fog meaning you can't see much.

* Smoke sauna

Fairly uncommon even in Finland, this is the original type of sauna our ancestors used before any early civilization existed. The basic idea is that you have a large, heavy stove but no chimney. The stove is warmed extremely hot, and then the fire is allowed to die. After flushing out the carbon monoxide, the sauna can be used via the residual heat in the stove. Despite the name there is no smoke inside while bathing (it would be dangerous due to carbon monoxide), but instead the name comes from smoke-coated walls of the room, which also gives the sauna a distinct smell.

In my view the question is, ""What system will work **best** for any particular country"".

Background: Sedentary behaviors predominate modern life, yet we do not fully understand the adverse effects of these behaviors on mortality after considering the benefits of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).

Objective: We tested the hypotheses that higher amounts of overall sitting time and television viewing are positively associated with mortality and described the independent and combined effects of these sedentary behaviors and MVPA on mortality.

Design: In the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, we examined 240,819 adults (aged 50–71 y) who did not report any cancer, cardiovascular disease, or respiratory disease at baseline. Mortality was ascertained over 8.5 y.

Results: Sedentary behaviors were positively associated with mortality after adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking, diet, race, and MVPA. Participants who reported the most television viewing (≥7 h compared with &lt;1 h/d) were at greater risk of all-cause (HR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.47, 1.76), cardiovascular (HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.56, 2.20), and cancer (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.40) mortality after adjustment for MVPA. Overall sitting was associated with all-cause mortality. Even among adults reporting high levels of MVPA (&gt;7 h/wk), high amounts of television viewing (≥7 h/d) remained associated with increased risk of all-cause (HR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.20, 1.79) and cardiovascular (HR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.33, 3.00) mortality compared with those reporting the least television viewing (&lt;1 h/d).

Conclusions: Time spent in sedentary behaviors was positively associated with mortality, and participation in high levels of MVPA did not fully mitigate health risks associated with prolonged time watching television. Adults should be encouraged to reduce time spent in sedentary behaviors, when possible, and to participate in MVPA at recommended levels. The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00340015."

My parents weren’t too concerned with the amount of usage since I was still rather social. However, my parents didn’t know the other dangers of social media back then. I’m not comfortable with my child having access to social media under 13 for safety reasons.  Not that 13 is some magical number mind you, but I don’t think you can do much to keep them off of it after that with cellphones. I’m not against kids using technology, I’m just worried about the weirdos targeting children. I remember having adults trying to meet up with me when I was in junior high through chat rooms and whatnot. What if I had said yes? What if my kid says yes? My little one doesn’t have the sort of grasp on the real world that I think is necessary to handle the responsibilities of social media. "

Abstract

Pediatric deaths due to children being left in hot cars remain a significant yet preventable public health concern. The current study aims to demonstrate the influence of vehicle type, time of day, and solar exposure (sun or shade) on the energy balance and core temperature (Tc) of a hypothetical two-year old boy left in a vehicle on a hot day. Cabin temperatures and relative humidity were collected within six enclosed vehicles under sun or full shade in Tempe, Arizona. These variables and radiation estimates were used to estimate the human energy balance and final Tc across 76 measurement cycles lasting approximately 60minutes.

Interior temperatures averaged 39.5°C and 47.6°C in the shade and sun, respectively, at steady-state. Based on the specific heat of a human body, the average Tc after 60 minutes in shaded or sun-exposed vehicles was estimated to reach 38.2±0.29°C and 39.1±0.41°C, respectively, with a significantly higher final Tc in sun-exposed vehicles across all days and in the shaded minivan. Extrapolation to 2 hours is estimated to result in heat injury in the sun.

Results demonstrate the influence of radiation on a child's thermal balance in a hot and dry environment. In real-world situations, it is critical to acknowledge variability between children, the starting car environment, and climate (e.g., humid versus dry), and that a child left in any vehicle car can experience potentially lethal core temperatures if forgotten, as shown by vehicular heat stroke statistics. Findings may improve public messaging and reinforce the need for policy action and technological adoption to prevent injury and death.

Yeah I don't understand, everyone complains about healthcare here but if you try to change it in anyway they start bitching that you are a socialist, and usually they make that criticism with zero suggestion in place for a better way. 

ObamaCare was a great example of this. Shitload of criticism from the right. I heard zero suggestions on alternatives, it was just ""its socialism, kill it with fire, fuck you"". They expect to just sit back and let the free market handle everything.


But for some unknown reason they cannot get it in their thick heads that the free market doesn't give a shit about their healthcare or whether they can afford it. Infinite demand, finite supply, costs go up, big surprise. And if you don't create systems that mitigate the brutality of free market healthcare, this is what you get.

Health,"**World Health Organization**: [""In view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at human-relevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals, and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures, the Meeting concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet.""](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/jmprsummary2016.pdf)

Health,"Whether it's conflicting really depends on how you interpret the evidence. In my opinion, the strongest evidence would be randomized controlled trials with mortality as an endpoint, and many of these have already been done. I'll let the studies speak for their selves:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27071971

&gt;The intervention group had significant reduction in serum cholesterol compared with controls...no mortality benefit for the intervention group...

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23386268

&gt;Replacement of dietary saturated fats...with omega 6 linoleic acid...The intervention group (n=221) had higher rates of death than controls (n=237)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2571009

&gt;2033 men...were allocated to receive or not to receive advice on...a reduction in fat intake and an increase in the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat...The advice on fat was not associated with any difference in mortality...

http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/4175085

&gt;...a diet containing 85 g soya bean oil and low in saturated fats...The number of deaths from coronary heart disease was 25 in each group. There was no significant difference between the groups. Relapse was not related to initial cholesterol level, change in cholesterol level or to diet.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673671910865

&gt;However, total mortality was similar in the two groups: 178 controls v. 174 experimentals, demonstrating an excess of non-atherosclerotic deaths in the experimental group. This was accounted for by a greater incidence of fatal carcinomas in the experimental group.

https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/12cd/73d7b49373d85ed4832d0b02241c9e018e54.pdf

&gt;...in the fully participating experimental group, three died of coronary heart disease, one died of other causes...in the inactive experimental group...five died of coronary heart disease...in the control group, all were still alive at the end of the observation period...Among the 814 original experimental group subjects, there have been 18 known deaths from causes other than coronary heart disease...compared to 6 such deaths among individuals in the control group.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14288105

&gt;It is concluded that under the circumstances of this trial corn oil cannot be recommended in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease.

http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/42/5/943.full.pdf

&gt;This seems to indicate that under the experimental conditions employed the degree of unsaturation of the diets did not significantly influence serum lipids or cardiovascular disease mortality.

&gt;And carbohydrates are extremely important for healthy body functioning. 

Well, yes and no.  You do not need to EAT much carbohydrate, as the liver will make the *very very small amount required*.  Your body can run on FFA and ketones and be very healthy.  In getting away from the deranged glucose/insulin situation of T2D and the whole body inflammation that contributes to CVD risk, keto has been shown in a clinical trial to reverse T2D and lower markers for CVD.

&gt;Keto May reverse CVD in relation to the standard American diet, but it’s doubtful that it will outcompete a WFPB.

You are welcome to your opinion about a WFPB diet vs keto.  I think we would both agree that WHOLE FOODS is the key, right?  Which you can do on keto, you can do on LCHF and you can even do with that standard carb diet with 55&amp;#37; of your diet from whole foods carbs.

&gt;Sufficient carbs are also necessary for immune function, thyroid function and libido.

That's  simply wrong.  Carbs are the only non\-essential macro because then liver can make it for you.  There is no work showing immune, thyroid or libido issues on keto.  In fact it's an excellent way to treat PCOS, which is connected to metabolic syndrome.

Health,"“We” need to take responsibility for or health and take individual responsibility for our choices. Looking to government to stop people from making poor decisions is not going to work.

Health,"&gt; This means that over 90% of the risk for the disease are modifiable risk factors ie diet and lifestyle

You're pursuing a degree in public health, so I encourage you to be a bit more critical of the literature.  Let's assume that the paper you cite is completely accurate and properly done.  

First, the paper is about age-stratified incidence.  In other words, this study does not indicate that modifiable risk factors can *prevent* CHD, only that they can *delay* CHD into another age stratum.  

Second, your interpretation (not necessarily the study) is subject to several kinds of bias.    The most important one is that correlation does not necessarily imply cause and effect.  You cannot know whether modifying these risk factors will decrease (or delay) CHD in women until you actually do the experiment suggested by the epidemiology: modify the risk factors with a control group and compare the incidence of CHD in the two groups.  There are dozens of reasons why such an experiment could fail to yield the results expected from epidemiology.

By doing such experiments we have learned many things that we did not expect: controlling modest levels of hypertension does not seem to be worth the effort, only a small fraction of people with hypertension are truly sensitive to salt intake, cholesterol-lowering drugs are really only of benefit to persons at risk, not to the general population, etc.  Yet, despite large-scale *expensive clinical studies aimed at preventive interventions* that contradict inferences from earlier epidemiological studies, a lot of people still believe in the headlines derived from epidemiology.  This weighs against your point elsewhere about neglecting to fund studies about prevention."

Health,"&gt; The ingredients in junk food are not fit for human consumption, we aren’t supposed to be munching down on concentrated doses of oil, sugar, ~~salt~~, ~~animal products~~ etc... Humans are meant to eat real food that grows out of the ground like ~~beans~~, ~~lentils~~, vegetables, ~~fruits~~.

Open up an anthropology book sometimes. Humans are absolutely meant to eat mass amounts of animal products.

Meat consumption is what made us human, our brains huge, and our intestines and metabolism simple, more than 2,000,000 years ago. Starchy plants came much later with the advent of agriculture ~30,000 years ago, precisely when our brains started to shrink, and chronic diseases started to pop up.

The confusion comes from the fact that carbohydrates compete with fat and protein for energy production and glycogen storage. Fructose and glucose block their metabolism, they accumulate, insulin resistance develops. Then glucose is redirected to increasingly pathological pathways, and need more and more insulin to dispose. Diabetes in a nutshell.

This is why protein and fat seems to ""cause"" diabetes in studies that inadequately control against carbohydrate intake. This is what the sugar industry, the grain industry, and vegans exploit to demonize animal products. But it all starts with carbohydrates and their effects on protein and fat metabolism, and it ends with carbohydrates since they are the main source of that excess glucose. And you do not need dietary fat, excess glucose and fructose will be happily turned into palmitic acid.

If you want specifics, carbohydrates increase malonyl-CoA, which blocks CPT-1 mediated fatty acid uptake into the mitochondria and subsequent beta oxidation, so you have less acetyl-CoA for energy and ketogenesis, and more fatty acids for synthesis of triglycerides, diglycerides, and ceramides, which contribute to insulin resistance among others.

You are correct on sugar (and refined carbohydrates), but you have to realize that this is an inherent effect of all carbohydrates, except turned up to eleven. You are spot on with processed oils, no argument there.

&gt; The tobacco industry manipulated the renowned children’s rights agency UNICEF for more than a dozen years, from 2003 until at least 2016, during which time UNICEF’s focus on children’s rights to a tobacco-free life was reduced, according to previously secret documents uncovered by UC San Francisco.

Abstract

The manufacture, use, and marketing of tobacco present a serious threat to children’s right to health. This makes the Convention on the Rights of the Child a potentially powerful tobacco-control tool and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which oversees the convention’s implementation, a potential leader in tobacco control. UNICEF actively supported tobacco control initiatives in the late 1990s, but since the early 2000s UNICEF’s role in tobacco control has been minimal. Using the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents library, an online collection of previously secret tobacco industry documents, we sought to uncover information on the tobacco industry’s ties with UNICEF. We found that from 1997 to 2000, when UNICEF was actively promoting tobacco control to support children’s rights, the tobacco industry saw children’s rights and UNICEF as potentially powerful threats to business that needed to be closely monitored and neutralized. The industry then positioned itself as a partner with UNICEF on youth smoking prevention initiatives as a way to avoid meaningful tobacco control measures that could save children’s lives. After UNICEF’s corporate engagement guidelines were loosened in 2003, tobacco companies successfully engaged with UNICEF directly and via front groups, including the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation. This was part of an overall tobacco industry strategy to improve its corporate image, infiltrate the United Nations, and weaken global tobacco-control efforts. As part of its mission to protect children’s rights, UNICEF should end all partnerships with the tobacco industry and its front groups."

&gt;As for funding ""heart disease prevention with dietary means"", how is more funding going to make people do what they do not want to do?

Well the average child sees about 7 minutes of advertisements a year for fruits and veggies and about 100 hours for kids cereals, so I would suggest social marketing campaigns. I mean if we advertised the true benefit of plants, I think people might have a little more of an informed decision.

Why don’t children want to eat fruits and vegetables? Turn on the TV and you will quickly find the answer to that question.

I’m not saying grant funding is going to solve our problems, but I don’t really think people understand the causes of disease in a way that actually benefits people other than pharmaceuticals.

For example, google: National Diabetes Statistics Report 2017 by the CDC

Scroll down to Risk Factors for complications, page 8.

Not a single word about diet. Not a single word about diet in the whole report.

What were the risk factors?

Smoking

Overweight and obesity

Physical inactivity

High blood pressure 

High cholesterol 

High blood glucose 

Okay, but what causes this things? Most of them are directly caused by diet, if not perpetuated with poor diet, and yet they don’t mention the word diet or food a single time in the whole 20 page report on diabetes. This is the source of my frustration. The ignorance of diet in the face of biomarkets that observe the true source of disease which is simply the toxic foods we feed ourselves and children. I mean just look at the lunch menu of schools in your district and tell me they promote health with a serious face. They serve donuts and crackers at my schools on a daily basis. Processed and refined foods, fried foods, calorie dense and animal product heavy. It’s much more than simply grant funding, but grant funding plays a large role. "

Fruits and veggies are the only things on my weekly budget, and they are way cheaper than meat and cheeses. Saying that a vegan diet is expensive is just wrong, so many people do it so cheap, and I’ve even read stories about college students who ended up being vegetarian/vegan because they couldn’t afford meat.

Health,"&gt; I was trying to demonstrate that the world is not truly deterministic. Even if it was, we will never be able to predict the outcome of the universe with 100% certainty. I’d argue that free will could exist within those parameters of fundamental physics.

This is similar to the god of the gaps fallacy:

https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps

Where somebody says, 'we don't know how the universe was created, so I'd argue god could exist within those parameters'. It seems you're trying to stick free will into whatever crevice you can fit it in. However, just as with theists, since you're the one making the claim that something exists, the burden of proof is on you.

&gt; If you do a bit of research (you’ve proven you haven’t) you’ll find that there’s plenty of what scientists are calling evidence for free will.

The only thing I've seen is a study that challenged the validity of the Libet experiment. However, I've always found the Libet experiment to be a pretty weak argument against free will anyway. If you've got anything more compelling than that, feel free to post it.

&gt; You just sound close minded and not open to new ideas and different ways of thinking.

Believe it or not, I actually used to believe in free will until about 10 months ago. But once I sat down and thought seriously about it (and with a little help from psychedelics), I realized that in the natural world, sans any supernatural involvement, free will didn't make a damn bit of sense. I'd be very curious how you think free will is supposed to work on the micro level. As in, chemically, what part of your brain is the 'prime mover' and has the ability to act outside of the known laws of the universe?

Abstract

The underlying pathology of atopic dermatitis (AD) includes impaired skin barrier function, susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus skin infection, immune dysregulation, and cutaneous dysbiosis. Our recent investigation into the potential role of Gram-negative skin bacteria in AD revealed that isolates of one particular commensal, Roseomonas mucosa, collected from healthy volunteers (HVs) improved outcomes in mouse and cell culture models of AD. In contrast, isolates of R. mucosa from patients with AD worsened outcomes in these models. These preclinical results suggested that interventions targeting the microbiome could provide therapeutic benefit for patients with AD. As a first test of this hypothesis in humans, 10 adult and 5 pediatric patients were enrolled in an open-label phase I/II safety and activity trial (the Beginning Assessment of Cutaneous Treatment Efficacy for Roseomonas in Atopic Dermatitis trial; BACTERiAD I/II). Treatment with R. mucosa was associated with significant decreases in measures of disease severity, topical steroid requirement, and S. aureus burden. There were no adverse events or treatment complications. We additionally evaluated differentiating bacterial metabolites and topical exposures that may contribute to the skin dysbiosis associated with AD and/or influence future microbiome-based treatments. These early results support continued evaluation of R. mucosa therapy with a placebo-controlled trial.

Health,"&gt;standard carb diet

That’s a new term. Tell me, when people eat standard carbs, are they free from added oils?

Take a donut, it has more calories from fat than from carbohydrates. I’m not saying it’s the fat not the carbs, but I’m saying that it’s both.

And carbohydrates are extremely important for healthy body functioning. Eating resistant starch that makes it down to the Colon prevents Colon cancer. 

Processed and refined carbohydrates don’t promote health when you compare it with unprocessed and unrefined foods, plants or animals for that matter. 

You can reverse T2DM and CVD with a whole food plant based diet.

To my knowledge Keto doesn’t reduce the risk for CVD especially not compared to WFPBD.

Keto May reverse CVD in relation to the standard American diet, but it’s doubtful that it will outcompete a WFPB. 

And before you like me something like the A to Z study, realize that this study didn’t even have people eating a WFPBD as participants consumer about 30% of calories from fat which is nowhere near the 10-15% recommended by WFPB advocates. "

&gt; The 'nocebo effect': Is Googling your symptoms making them worse?


&gt; Research suggests correlation between looking up potential side-effects and experiencing them


&gt; ""Nocebo is kind of the opposite"" of placebo, Dr. Baiju Shah, a senior scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, told The Current's Anna Maria Tremonti.


&gt; His team of researchers reviewed patient intolerance to statins — a common cholesterol-lowering drug — in 13 countries across five continents. They then compared the recorded intolerance rate to the availability of websites that discuss the adverse effects of statins, through each country's Google search engine.

Background

The nocebo effect, where patients with expectations of adverse effects are more likely to experience them, may contribute to the high rate of statin intolerance found in observational studies. Information that patients read on the internet may be a precipitant of this effect. The objective of the study was to establish whether the number of websites about statin side effects found using Google is associated with the prevalence of statin intolerance.

Methods

The prevalence of statin intolerance in 13 countries across 5 continents was established in a recent study via a web-based survey of primary care physicians and specialists. Using the Google search engine for each country, the number of websites about statin side effects was determined, and standardized to the number of websites about statins overall. Searches were restricted to pages in the native language, and were conducted after connecting to each country using a virtual private network (VPN).

Results

English-speaking countries (Australia, Canada, UK, USA) had the highest prevalence of statin intolerance and also had the largest standardized number of websites about statin side effects. The sample Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables was 0.868.

Conclusions

Countries where patients using Google are more likely to find websites about statin side effects have greater levels of statin intolerance. The nocebo effect driven by online information may be contributing to statin intolerance.

Highlights

•English-speaking countries have the largest number of websites about statin side effects.
•The number of websites about statin side effects in a country was correlated with its prevalence of statin intolerance.
•The nocebo effect driven by internet searches may be contributing to statin intolerance.

Health,Seriously?  Is this with all/many foods?
Health,"You brought a valid argument. But we are the only species that eats a lot of stuff! Like cooked foods for example. Or all the processed foods! Some actually do eat just raw like animals basically, but i think there is quite some proof the cooking allowed us to evolve as it makes other micro nutrients available. And as it may kill some bad stuff. Even pesticides and the hormones in milk maybe! I think fermented foods would normally be fine so yogurts, cheese.. Even tho the source of the milk is not really a good one usually. Like because of pregnancy hormones the cows get, inflammation inducing foods, antibiotica! Of course there's some exceptions. But I am pretty sure of you look into history, a part of humans have always dependended heavily on milk and its products, so wouldn't that already make it natural? I mean animals also adapt, if one of their food sources goes missing they find something else. So then it wasn't natural before but it becomes natural. When we were still microbes, dust, whatever we didn't eat any of what we set now. If that makes sense. So I think that argument cow milk is only for baby cows, you could also bring this same logic onto eggs and other things. If that makes sense."

Which is why it's so important to encourage a shift towards safer alternatives.

Oh yes I heard all the excuses. ""Light cigarettes are better than normal cigarettes"". ""Methadone is safer than heroine"". ""This is not rat poison, it is slow release rat poison"". Yadda yadda. Still not as effective as abstinence, sorry.


&gt; r/keto is leaking. You can still lose weight easily doing a whole foods plant based diet that is rich in high carbohydrate foods. Key point being WHOLE FOODS. It's so incredibly naive and misguided to claim carbohydrates in general are bad or a drug, laughable in fact.

I will let you in a little secret, although one that is very obvious if you think about it. Carbohydrates still have inherently negative effects, even from whole sources. Studies on whole high carb diets you have mentioned, such as by Ornish, simply hide this by careful study design.

They remove obviously harmful foods (refined carbs, processed oils), they add a bunch of confounders (exercise, stress management, smoking cessation, support groups, statins, etc), and remove every single nutrient whose metabolism is affected by carbohydrates (sodium, protein, fat, saturated fat, omega 6 polyunsaturated fats, leucine, methionine, choline, carnitine, etc).

It is hilarious they do not even allow avocados, let alone unlimited fruit consumption! And yet they can barely compete with low carb diets, which merely restrict carbohydrates along with processed oils.

Abstract

Background

Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) may facilitate melanoma detection, but data comparing a CNN’s diagnostic performance to larger groups of dermatologists are lacking.

Methods

Google’s Inception v4 CNN architecture was trained and validated using dermoscopic images and corresponding diagnoses. In a comparative cross-sectional reader study a 100-image test-set was used (level-I: dermoscopy only; level-II: dermoscopy plus clinical information and images). Main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) for diagnostic classification (dichotomous) of lesions by the CNN versus an international group of 58 dermatologists during level-I or -II of the reader study. Secondary end points included the dermatologists’ diagnostic performance in their management decisions and differences in the diagnostic performance of dermatologists during level-I and -II of the reader study. Additionally, the CNN’s performance was compared with the top-five algorithms of the 2016 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) challenge.

Results

In level-I dermatologists achieved a mean (±standard deviation) sensitivity and specificity for lesion classification of 86.6% (±9.3%) and 71.3% (±11.2%), respectively. More clinical information (level-II) improved the sensitivity to 88.9% (±9.6%, P = 0.19) and specificity to 75.7% (±11.7%, P &lt; 0.05). The CNN ROC curve revealed a higher specificity of 82.5% when compared with dermatologists in level-I (71.3%, P &lt; 0.01) and level-II (75.7%, P &lt; 0.01) at their sensitivities of 86.6% and 88.9%, respectively. The CNN ROC AUC was greater than the mean ROC area of dermatologists (0.86 versus 0.79, P &lt; 0.01). The CNN scored results close to the top three algorithms of the ISBI 2016 challenge.

Conclusions

For the first time we compared a CNN’s diagnostic performance with a large international group of 58 dermatologists, including 30 experts. Most dermatologists were outperformed by the CNN. Irrespective of any physicians’ experience, they may benefit from assistance by a CNN’s image classification.

&gt; Free smoking cessation aids, such as nicotine patches and chewing gum, are a staple of many corporate wellness programs aimed at encouraging employees to kick the habit. But, new research shows that merely offering such aids for free does not help employees quit, whereas supplementing them with financial incentives is three times more effective. The study, led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, also provides the first large-scale evidence that offering e-cigarettes to known smokers is not effective at helping smokers stay smoke-free.

A Pragmatic Trial of E-Cigarettes, Incentives, and Drugs for Smoking Cessation.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Whether financial incentives, pharmacologic therapies, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) promote smoking cessation among unselected smokers is unknown.

METHODS

We randomly assigned smokers employed by 54 companies to one of four smoking-cessation interventions or to usual care. Usual care consisted of access to information regarding the benefits of smoking cessation and to a motivational text-messaging service. The four interventions consisted of usual care plus one of the following: free cessation aids (nicotine-replacement therapy or pharmacotherapy, with e-cigarettes if standard therapies failed); free e-cigarettes, without a requirement that standard therapies had been tried; free cessation aids plus $600 in rewards for sustained abstinence; or free cessation aids plus $600 in redeemable funds, deposited in a separate account for each participant, with money removed from the account if cessation milestones were not met. The primary outcome was sustained smoking abstinence for 6 months after the target quit date.

RESULTS

Among 6131 smokers who were invited to enroll, 125 opted out and 6006 underwent randomization. Sustained abstinence rates through 6 months were 0.1% in the usual-care group, 0.5% in the free cessation aids group, 1.0% in the free e-cigarettes group, 2.0% in the rewards group, and 2.9% in the redeemable deposit group. With respect to sustained abstinence rates, redeemable deposits and rewards were superior to free cessation aids (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.006, respectively, with significance levels adjusted for multiple comparisons). Redeemable deposits were superior to free e-cigarettes (P=0.008). Free e-cigarettes were not superior to usual care (P=0.20) or to free cessation aids (P=0.43). Among the 1191 employees (19.8%) who actively participated in the trial (the “engaged” cohort), sustained abstinence rates were four to six times as high as those among participants who did not actively engage in the trial, with similar relative effectiveness.

CONCLUSIONS

In this pragmatic trial of smoking cessation, financial incentives added to free cessation aids resulted in a higher rate of sustained smoking abstinence than free cessation aids alone. Among smokers who received usual care (information and motivational text messages), the addition of free cessation aids or e-cigarettes did not provide a benefit.

Cooking here means heating above a certain temperature, and that temperature is very very low for polyunsaturated fats (this includes all oils that you have ever heard of except saturated oils (coconut oil and cow Ghee)) 

(Edit: Forgot to say that (monounsaturated fat) olive oil (NOT VIRGIN) can be cooked to 350F for ""safe cooking"")


So if you ever want to eat meat, eat it ""Baked"" or cooked at a low temperature for a long time because if you rapidly heat your meat (like in frying), the (polyunsaturated) fat in those meats chemically changes to generate carcinogens.


The safest choice in my opinion is eating non vegan foods in ultra moderation and maximizing your veggies and eating low calorie fruits for taste.

Health,"Thank you for the link, which as you argue does not support classifying obesity and sugar consumption with drug abuse. From my perspective, as a non-scientist, nothing is explaining why increasingly, more people are dying through obesity than other causes (as in the first link I sent you). To me, arguing whether or not excessive food and/or sugar consumption are addictive behaviours is pointless, in the same way as arguing whether or not smoking tobacco is comparable to any other drug addictions - the point being, it kills people. The causes, why’s and wherefores may preoccupy scientific researchers who build their careers upon it but from the layperson’s perspective, obesity and excessive sugar consumption is killing more and more people every day. 
Criticising journalists - who are citing scientific findings - for reporting on this phenomena seems to be like the current popularist approach to calling all unpalatable news ‘fake news’, particularly ironical in the light of the various scientific researchers who eagerly stepped up to corroborate the multinationals profiting from say asbestos, cigarettes, various medical strategies (say pelvic mesh implants) the list is endless. You advise me to be careful about which journalists to trust when reading of these matters, in case the report is merely expressing a journalists opinion. Thank you for your advice, but be reassured, I am indeed careful about such matters."

Abstract

Objective To investigate the relation of diet quality with structural brain tissue volumes and focal vascular lesions in a dementia-free population.

Methods From the population-based Rotterdam Study, 4,447 participants underwent dietary assessment and brain MRI scanning between 2005 and 2015. We excluded participants with an implausible energy intake, prevalent dementia, or cortical infarcts, leaving 4,213 participants for the current analysis. A diet quality score (0–14) was calculated reflecting adherence to Dutch dietary guidelines. Brain MRI was performed to obtain information on brain tissue volumes, white matter lesion volume, lacunes, and cerebral microbleeds. The associations of diet quality score and separate food groups with brain structures were assessed using multivariable linear and logistic regression.

Results We found that better diet quality related to larger brain volume, gray matter volume, white matter volume, and hippocampal volume. Diet quality was not associated with white matter lesion volume, lacunes, or microbleeds. High intake of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts, dairy, and fish and low intake of sugar-containing beverages were associated with larger brain volumes.

Conclusions A better diet quality is associated with larger brain tissue volumes. These results suggest that the effect of nutrition on neurodegeneration may act via brain structure. More research, in particular longitudinal research, is needed to unravel direct vs indirect effects between diet quality and brain health.

Health,"You're getting dowvoted, but you're correct. Speaking as a physician - marijuana does do this. It can unmask psychosis that was not yet evident. It can trigger psychiatric disease earlier or trigger disease that might otherwise have not occurred. Onset of disease manifesting with psychosis is earlier in patients who smoke weed, and happens at a slightly higher rate.

Another medical issue is marijuana induced cyclic vomiting. It's always fascinating when a patient comes in and absolutely refuses to believe that's the reason. It inevitably takes 3-5 more visits before they give stopping we'd a try, and then suddenly magically their vomiting is resolved.

Marijuana is not totally benign. It does have dangers associated. I'll be down voted for saying so, but it's the truth. I'm not going to judge you for smoking weed, but I sure as hell will judge you if you plug up your ears, go ""la la la la la can't hear you"" when dangers associated with it are discussed."

What it is doing is costing tax payers billions of dollars to fight a war on drugs that is in fact un-winnable in the first place. All that money wasted could be going towards something like helping to treat people with addiction, mental health, medical research or even drug education. If you legalize drugs it takes away the current black market for them and in essence saves many lives and hurts organized crime. People may decide to do them and they may not, but in a free country that should also be a choice in my opinion.

Abstract

Aims

This review provides an up‐to‐date curated source of information on alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use and their associated mortality and burden of disease. Limitations in the data are also discussed, including how these can be addressed in the future.

Methods

Online data sources were identified through expert review. Data were mainly obtained from the World Health Organization, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

Results

In 2015, the estimated prevalence among the adult population was 18.3% for heavy episodic alcohol use (in the past 30 days); 15.2% for daily tobacco smoking; and 3.8%, 0.77%, 0.37%, and 0.35% for past‐year cannabis, amphetamine, opioid, and cocaine use, respectively. European regions had the highest prevalence of heavy episodic alcohol use and daily tobacco use. The age‐standardised prevalence of alcohol dependence was 843.2 per 100,000 people; for cannabis, opioids, amphetamines and cocaine dependence it was 259.3, 220.4, 86.0 and 52.5 per 100,000 people, respectively. High‐Income North America region had among the highest rates of cannabis, opioid, and cocaine dependence. Attributable disability‐adjusted life‐years (DALYs) were highest for tobacco (170.9 million DALYs), followed by alcohol (85.0 million) and illicit drugs (27.8 million). Substance‐attributable mortality rates were highest for tobacco (110.7 deaths per 100,000 people), followed by alcohol and illicit drugs (33.0, and 6.9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively). Attributable age‐standardised mortality rates and DALYs for alcohol and illicit drugs were highest in Eastern Europe; attributable age‐standardised tobacco mortality rates and DALYs were highest in Oceania.

Conclusions

In 2015 alcohol and tobacco use between them cost the human population more than a quarter of a billion disability‐adjusted life years, with illicit drugs costing a further tens of millions. Europeans proportionately suffered more but in absolute terms the mortality rate was greatest in low and middle income countries with large populations and where the quality of data was more limited. Better standardised and rigorous methods for data collection, collation and reporting are needed to assess more accurately the geographical and temporal trends in substance use and its disease burden."

Many studies show that engaging in these activities typically before the age of 15 is related to increased deviant activity (substance abuse, criminal behavior, etc.) down the road. Is it causal? No. Is every kid who smokes at a young age going to be a drug addict? No. But there is a relationship that should be examined further to develop interventions.

Abstract

The authors identified individual randomized controlled trials from previous meta-analyses and additional searches, and then performed meta-analyses on cardiovascular disease outcomes and all-cause mortality. The authors assessed publications from 2012, both before and including the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force review. Their systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed generally moderate- or low-quality evidence for preventive benefits (folic acid for total cardiovascular disease, folic acid and B-vitamins for stroke), no effect (multivitamins, vitamins C, D, β-carotene, calcium, and selenium), or increased risk (antioxidant mixtures and niacin [with a statin] for all-cause mortality). Conclusive evidence for the benefit of any supplement across all dietary backgrounds (including deficiency and sufficiency) was not demonstrated; therefore, any benefits seen

Summary

Background

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders, many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, dose-response, phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA. We included service personnel who were 18 years or older, with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more, and who had a Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) total score of 50 or greater. Using a web-based randomisation system, we randomly assigned participants (1:1:2) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy: 30 mg (active control), 75 mg, or 125 mg. We masked investigators, independent outcome raters, and participants until after the primary endpoint. MDMA was administered orally in two 8-h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy. The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS-IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session. Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100–125 mg MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open-label crossover, and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session. Safety was monitored through adverse events, spontaneously reported expected reactions, vital signs, and suicidal ideation and behaviour. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01211405.

Findings

Between Nov 10, 2010, and Jan 29, 2015, 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg (n=7), 75 mg (n=7), or 125 mg (n=12) of MDMA plus psychotherapy. At the primary endpoint, the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity (mean change CAPS-IV total scores of −58·3 [SD 9·8] and −44·3 [28·7]; p=0·001) than the 30 mg group (−11·4 [12·7]). Compared with the 30 mg group, Cohen's d effect sizes were large: 2·8 (95% CI 1·19–4·39) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 (0·04–2·08) for the 125 mg group. In the open-label crossover with full-dose MDMA (100–125 mg), PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg (p=0·01), whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment (p=0·81). PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12-month follow-up compared with baseline after all groups had full-dose MDMA (mean CAPS-IV total score of 38·8 [SD 28·1] vs 87·1 [16·1]; p&lt;0·0001). 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants. Of these adverse events, four (5%) were serious: three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment.

Interpretation

Active doses (75 mg and 125 mg) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders.

Health,"I would love to see a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial for these things. Generally it would be unethical to assign someone to a zero carb diet and another group to a whole food plant based diet and see which lives longer.

I really don’t have the time to explain this in a way that will align with the reductionist paradigm of unidirectional and 2 dimensional cause and effect.

Feel free to put faith in a placebo controlled RCT over something like the 7th Day Adventist health study because the healthy study was observational and we cannot imply causality. Well we are going to die before there is data implicating causality.

This was the same argument the tobacco lobby successfully touted. You can’t imply cause and effect because it’s only correlation. There is a preponderance if evidence on this, but there is also evidence to the contrary. Industry funded studies often show how their products promote health.

You talk about cholesterol but what about Mendelian randomized trials showing those born with genetically higher cholesterol get more heart attacks? Sure the drugs that lower cholesterol don’t actually save lives. A whole food plant based diet has been shows as the only diet to prevent and reverse heart disease and its reimbursable by Medicare actually. Intensive cardiac rehabilitation program by Dean Ornish.

We do know that a majority of the people dying from chronic disease, didn’t have to die from such diseases. I’m not saying we are going to keep people alive forever, only that chronic disease, doesn’t have to be inevitable. 

This is why epidemiology seems so important to me. Because you can see populations with absolutely zero hypertension and low heart disease rates. You can find populations with the ApoE4 gene and yet no Alzheimer’s. You can see as affluent people get certain diseases and poor people get others. 


I am much more interested in systemic research than the reductionist paradigm that supposed cause must always precede effect. What about systems? 

The problem with cause and effect relationships, is that the only ones we have, that live up to your standards, truly tell us very little about helping people live lives with less suffering. We know more about cause and effect in non human animals because many cause and effect study designs would be unethical. Randomize someone to smoke every day of their life and others not to smoke and see which one dies more. This is what you’re asking but with diet. 

I’m not blaming you, I’m saying that the burden of proof would be impossible given ethical implications.

You can choose to believe what you want to believe, but epidemiology has helped me form better decision than the differential bacterial formation of an enzyme in the scrotum of a lab rat. "

Some people really wanted to get the impression that the implication of wine studies was that alcohol is good. Fruit is good, minus the sugars or alcohols that emerge from their products.

The source of variability in outcomes has not been clearly established from what I can tell. It probably depends on the type of wine, the quantity, and the characteristics of the diets of the people drinking these wines regarding their content and the ultimate bioavailability of the plant polyphenols within the wine combined with the diet. Resveratrol for example though useful on its own, a variety of studies have shown is reinforced by other phytochemicals.

Lots of variables. The short of it is that if you want your own results to coincide closer with the positive studies rather than the negative take plant extracts that contain high concentrations of the relevant molecules from respectable companies that ensure honest quantities and bioavailabilities, through the right micronizations and combinations, and exclude the alcohol."

A naturalistic examination of the perceived effects of cannabis on negative affect

Highlights

•Cannabis significantly reduced ratings of depression, anxiety, and stress.

•Women reported larger reductions in anxiety as a function of cannabis than did men.

•Low THC/high CBD cannabis was best for reducing perceived symptoms of depression.

•High THC/high CBD cannabis was best for reducing perceived symptoms of stress.

•Use of cannabis to treat depression appears to exacerbate depression over time.

Background

Cannabis is commonly used to alleviate symptoms of negative affect. However, a paucity of research has examined the acute effects of cannabis on negative affect in everyday life. The current study provides a naturalistic account of perceived changes in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress as a function of dose and concentration of Δ9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).

Method

Data from the app StrainprintTM (which provides medical cannabis users a means of tracking changes in symptoms as a function of different doses and chemotypes of cannabis) were analyzed using multilevel modeling. In total, 11,953 tracked sessions were analyzed (3,151 for depression, 5,085 for anxiety, and 3,717 for stress).

Results

Medical cannabis users perceived a 50% reduction in depression and a 58% reduction in anxiety and stress following cannabis use. Two puffs were sufficient to reduce ratings of depression and anxiety, while 10+ puffs produced the greatest perceived reductions in stress. High CBD (&gt;9.5%)/low THC (&lt;5.5%) cannabis was associated with the largest changes in depression ratings, while high CBD (&gt;11%)/high THC (&gt;26.5%) cannabis produced the largest perceived changes in stress. No changes in the perceived efficacy of cannabis were detected across time. However, baseline symptoms of depression (but not anxiety or stress) appeared to be exacerbated across time/tracked sessions.

Limitations

The primary limitations are the self-selected nature of the sample and the inability to control for expectancy effects.

Conclusions

Cannabis reduces perceived symptoms of negative affect in the short-term, but continued use may exacerbate baseline symptoms of depression over time.

Also, MDs get a lot more training on nutrition than 1 day. That claim is so far from the truth I’m not even sure where I would begin to address it.

Abstract

Objective

The possible impact of stress on cancer incidence remains controversial. We prospectively evaluated associations between life event stressors, social support, personality characteristics (optimism, anger control, antiemotionality), and risk of developing primary breast cancer (BCa), in women at increased familial risk of BCa.

Methods

A prospective cohort, repeated measures design was used. Recruitment was through the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer, which collects genetic, epidemiological, and clinical data from Australasian families with multiple BCa cases. Acute and chronic stressors for the prior 3 years and psychosocial, clinical, and epidemiological variables were measured at cohort entry and at 3‐yearly intervals. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis controlling for BCa risk factors and familial clustering was undertaken. The primary outcome was histopathologically confirmed BCa (invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ, including occult cases diagnosed during risk‐reducing mastectomy).

Results

Of 3595 consecutive women invited to participate, 3054 (85.0%) consented. Of these, 2739 (89.7%) from 990 families (range 1‐16 per family) completed at least 1 assessment point. During the study, 103 women were diagnosed with BCa. No stressor or psychosocial variable or interaction between them was significantly associated with BCa in unadjusted or adjusted models (total acute stressors HR = 1.03 [0.99‐1.08], P = .19; total chronic stressors HR = 1.0 [0.90‐1.11], P = .98).

Conclusions

This study did not demonstrate an association between acute and chronic stressors, social support, optimism, antiemotionality or anger control, and BCa risk. Women should focus on proven methods of BCa risk reduction.

Health,"Conservatives have routinely tried to make birth control unaffordable or not accessible. Look at the hobby lobby decision about employers being able to decide if someone can use a certain form of birth control or not. Also, if they are so pro-life, they should be pro-birth control, as it prevents the need for abortions. Instead they are preaching abstinence only, which statistics show increases unplanned pregnancies. 

There is the issue of bodily autonomy, which a living breathing woman should be able to have. A potential life should not take that away. If it is, that makes women have no value other than for their reproductive abilities. Since a fetus can not survive outside the womb before a certain point, why would we give it more rights than the living breathing person carrying it?

There are many people who never want to be pregnant or have children. Sterilization is a surgical procedure that many doctors still deny to women because they “might change their minds.” With our options being so limited, abortion needs to remain available and safe. People still had abortions before it was legal, but many women died from it."

I also think it is fantastic that there is research being done into male hormonal contraceptives, as that is one more option for people trying to decide on what form of contraception to use. 

However, personally I would never take a hormonal contraceptive as the immediate side effects and potential long term side effects just don't make it worth it for me. I would also make sure any partner I was with that decided to use a hormonal contraceptive was well informed on the decision, and although it would obviously be their choice, I would prefer it if they did not. 

I would always prefer to just use condoms. Anyone that belittles a man for not wanting to use hormonal contraceptives is no better than a man who tries to push a woman into doing the same. "

CBD is responsible for 95% of the currently known therapeutic benefits  of cannabis including seizure control. This works for about 80% of epilepsy sufferers to whatever varying degrees. About 2/3 of the remaining 20% respond to the CBD when 3%-5% THC is added. This is still low enough not to intoxicate after the first few uses.

Abstract

Mobile phones are an essential part of an adolescent's life, leading them to text, phone, or message into the night. Longitudinal latent growth models were used to examine relations between changes in adolescent night‐time mobile phone use, changes in sleep behavior, and changes in well‐being (depressed mood, externalizing behavior, self‐esteem, and coping) for 1,101 students (43% male) between 13 and 16 years old. Both night‐time mobile phone use and poor sleep behavior underwent positive linear growth over time. Increased night‐time mobile phone use was directly associated with increased externalizing behavior and decreased self‐esteem and coping. Changes in sleep behavior mediated the relation between early changes in night‐time mobile phone use and later increases in depressed mood and externalizing behavior and later declines in self‐esteem and coping.

But despite many doctors having something of a God complex they're only human. Admission of errors and looking to fix those errors is a daily part of my job in IT. If we don't know why an error occured we can't fix it.

 There should however be consequences for errors, however they need to be proportional to the type of error. If an admission of error that threatens your livelihood it's not very likely that you'll ever admit it."

Sugar and carbs cause obesity by screwing up fat metabolism and hunger signals. They also cause cancer by damaging mitochondria and preventing mitochondrial biogenesis.

Excess omega 6 from processed oils also play a role by providing concentrated calories and exacerbating inflammatory signals used for growth of cells and blood vessels.

Calories in general contribute, fat and protein compete with glucose for energy production and glycogen storage. Fructose and glucose block their metabolism, they accumulate, insulin resistance develops. Then glucose is redirected to increasingly pathological pathways, and need more and more insulin to dispose. Diabetes in a nutshell.

----

Mitochondria are essential for apoptosis and for efficient energy generation. Sufficiently damaged mitochondria are incapable of mustering enough energy to initiate apoptosis and will ignore apoptosis signals.

Malfunctioning mitochondria will also generate mass amounts of reactive oxygen species, which damage the genome in both the mitochondria and the nucleus, giving rise to the various mutations found in cancer.

ROS are also signals for insufficient energy. They force the cell to look for alternative sources of energy such as fermentation of glucose and glutamine. They also trigger growth of new blood vessels to ensure nutrient and energy supply in the future. These are all hallmarks of cancer.

&gt; Researchers from Hebrew SeniorLife’s Institute for Aging Research, and Boston Medical Center have reported that one-third of people 40-59 years have image-based evidence of moderate to severe degenerative disc disease and more than half had moderate to severe spinal osteoarthritis. Beyond that, the prevalence of disc height narrowing and joint osteoarthritis increased 2 to 4 fold in those aged 60-69 and 70-89 respectively. Furthermore, scientists observed that progression of these conditions occurred 40 – 70% more frequently in women than men.

Abstract:

Background Context

Prevalence and progression of disc height narrowing (DHN) and facet joint osteoarthritis (FJOA) in the thoracic and lumbar regions in non-clinical populations are not well established.

Purpose

The present study aimed to use computed tomography (CT) images to determine the prevalence and progression of DHN and FJOA according to age, sex, and spinal region.

Study Design

This is a 6-year longitudinal study.

Sample

A total of 1,195 members of the Framingham Study (mean baseline age 61±9 years) were included in the study.

Outcome Measures

We compared the prevalence and progression (new or worsening) of moderate-to-severe DHN and FJOA by age, sex, and spinal region.

Methods

A musculoskeletal radiologist evaluated DHN and FJOA from T4/T5 to L4/L5 on baseline and follow-up CT images using a semi-quantitative scale: 0=normal, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe.

Results

One-third or more of women and men ages 40–59 years at baseline had imaged-based evidence of prevalent DHN, more than half had prevalent FJOA, and DHN and FJOA prevalence increased approximately two- to fourfold in those age 60–69 and 70–89 years at baseline, respectively (p&lt;.01). Progression of DHN and FJOA occurred more frequently at the lumbar than at the thoracic spine and more in women than in men (DHN: odds ratio [OR]=1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07, 1.88; FJOA: OR=1.70, CI=1.33, 2.17).

Conclusions

Prevalence and progression of moderate-to-severe DHN and FJOA are common in non-clinical populations of older adults. The high frequency of spinal degeneration observed on CTs in this community-based study may contribute to challenges in interpreting the clinical significance of imaging evidence of DHN and FJOA. Future studies investigating the association of CT-based spinal degenerative features with pain and functional impairments in population-based samples are needed to help determine the clinical significance of imaged-based findings of DHN and FJOA."

Abstract

Defensins are cationic antimicrobial peptides expressed throughout the plant and animal kingdoms as a first line of defense against pathogens. Membrane targeting and disruption is a crucial function of many defensins, however the precise mechanism remains unclear. Certain plant defensins form dimers that specifically bind the membrane phospholipids phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, thereby triggering the assembly of defensin–lipid oligomers that permeabilize cell membranes. To understand this permeabilization mechanism, here we determine the crystal structure of the plant defensin NaD1 bound to PA. The structure reveals a 20-mer that adopts a concave sheet- or carpet-like topology where NaD1 dimers form one face and PA acyl chains form the other face of the sheet. Furthermore, we show that Arg39 is critical for PA binding, oligomerization and fungal cell killing. These findings identify a putative defensin–phospholipid membrane attack configuration that supports a longstanding proposed carpet mode of membrane disruption.

“In summary, the existing neuroimaging literature offers little in the way of support for an FA model and we argue strongly against its selective presentation in support of the FA model, feeling that, ultimately, this will obfuscate a highly complex situation. However, given that there has been little specific exploration of the FA hypothesis, this, as has been argued (10), leaves a very limited dataset with which to draw conclusions about the FA model.

“The experimental question is whether or not sugar can be a substance of abuse and lead to a natural form of addiction. “Food addiction” seems plausible because brain pathways that evolved to respond to natural rewards are also activated by addictive drugs......A variety of foods can release DA in the NAc, including lab chow, sugar, saccharin, and corn oil (Bassareo and Di Chiara, 1997, Hajnal et al., 2004, Liang et al., 2006, Mark et al., 1991, Rada et al., 2005b). The rise in extracellular DA can outlast the meal in food-deprived rats (Hernandez and Hoebel, 1988). However, in satiated animals, this DA (dopamine) release appears to be contingent on novelty since it wanes with repeated access, even when the food is palatable (Bassareo and Di Chiara, 1997, Rada et al., 2005b). An exception, which is described below (Section 5.C.), is when animals are food deprived and fed sugar intermittently.”

If you’re interested, here’s a cool paper on how the dopamine theory of addiction is not the be all and end all of addiction:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25873042/

Just because people are consuming more sugar than ever does not mean it’s killing you. No doubt sugar isn’t healthy for you and in general as a population we need to reduce consumption but eating small amounts won’t do you any harm. In fact, completely cutting it out (as demonstrated by the animal literature) and only allowing yourself to have it on special occasions may actually be producing “addictive-like” behaviours as the only way they can demonstrate “food addiction”in animals is to make them hungry and give them intermittent access to sugar.

&gt; ...

&gt;The European Chemicals Agency, for example, concluded in March 2017 that “the available scientific evidence did not meet the criteria to classify glyphosate as a carcinogen.” This assessment, like IARC’s, looked for any potential cancer hazard glyphosate may pose to humans at any dose, not the actual cancer risk it poses at a specific dose.

Identifying county characteristics associated with resident well-being: A population based study. 

PLOS ONE, 2018; 13 (5): e0196720 

DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0196720

Abstract

Background

Well-being is a positively-framed, holistic assessment of health and quality of life that is associated with longevity and better health outcomes. We aimed to identify county attributes that are independently associated with a comprehensive, multi-dimensional assessment of individual well-being.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional study examining associations between 77 pre-specified county attributes and a multi-dimensional assessment of individual US residents’ well-being, captured by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index. Our cohort included 338,846 survey participants, randomly sampled from 3,118 US counties or county equivalents.

Findings

We identified twelve county-level factors that were independently associated with individual well-being scores. Together, these twelve factors explained 91% of the variance in individual well-being scores, and they represent four conceptually distinct categories: demographic (% black); social and economic (child poverty, education level [&lt;high school, high school diploma/equivalent, college degree], household income, % divorced); clinical care (% eligible women obtaining mammography, preventable hospital stays per 100,000, number of federally qualified health centers); and physical environment (% commuting by bicycle and by public transit).

Conclusions

Twelve factors across social and economic, clinical care, and physical environmental county-level factors explained the majority of variation in resident well-being.

Medical Oncologists’ Beliefs, Practices, and Knowledge Regarding Marijuana Used Therapeutically: A Nationally Representative Survey Study. 

Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2018; JCO.2017.76.122

Abstract
 
Background

Although almost every state medical marijuana (MM) law identifies cancer as a qualifying condition, little research supports MM’s use in oncology. We hypothesized that the discrepancy between these laws and the scientific evidence base poses clinical challenges for oncologists. Oncologists’ beliefs, knowledge, and practices regarding MM were examined in this study.

Methods

In November 2016, we mailed a survey on MM to a nationally-representative, random sample of 400 medical oncologists. Main outcome measures included whether oncologists reported discussing MM with patients, recommended MM clinically in the past year, or felt sufficiently informed to make such recommendations. The survey also queried oncologists’ views on MM’s comparative effectiveness for several conditions (including its use as an adjunct to standard pain management strategies) and its risks compared with prescription opioids. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using standard statistical techniques.

Results

The overall response rate was 63%. Whereas only 30% of oncologists felt sufficiently informed to make recommendations regarding MM, 80% conducted discussions about MM with patients, and 46% recommended MM clinically. Sixty-seven percent viewed it as a helpful adjunct to standard pain management strategies, and 65% thought MM is equally or more effective than standard treatments for anorexia and cachexia.

Conclusion

Our findings identify a concerning discrepancy between oncologists’ self-reported knowledge base and their beliefs and practices regarding MM. Although 70% of oncologists do not feel equipped to make clinical recommendations regarding MM, the vast majority conduct discussions with patients about MM and nearly one-half do, in fact, recommend it clinically. A majority believes MM is useful for certain indications. These findings are clinically important and suggest critical gaps in research, medical education, and policy regarding MM.

Abstract:

&gt; Later chronotype (i.e. evening preference) and later timing of sleep have been associated with greater morbidity, including higher rates of metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, no one has examined whether chronotype is associated with mortality risk to date. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that being an evening type is associated with increased mortality in a large cohort study, the UK Biobank. Our analysis included 433 268 adults aged 38–73 at the time of enrolment and an average 6.5-year follow-up. The primary exposure was chronotype, as assessed through a single self-reported question-defining participants as definite morning types, moderate morning types, moderate evening types or definite evening types. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and mortality due to CVD. Prevalent disease was also compared among the chronotype groups. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, sleep duration, socioeconomic status and comorbidities. Greater eveningness, particularly being a definite evening type, was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of all comorbidities. Comparing definite evening type to definite morning type, the associations were strongest for psychological disorders (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.86–2.02, p = &lt; 0.001), followed by diabetes (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.24–1.36, p = &lt; 0.001), neurological disorders (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.20–1.30, p = &lt; 0.001), gastrointestinal/abdominal disorders (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.19–1.27, p = &lt; 0.001) and respiratory disorders (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.18–1.26, p = &lt; 0.001). The total number of deaths was 10 534, out of which 2127 were due to CVD. Greater eveningness, based on chronotype as an ordinal variable, was associated with a small increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.004–1.05, p = 0.017) and CVD mortality (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00–1.09, p = 0.06). Compared to definite morning types, definite evening types had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02–1.18, p = 0.012). This first report of increased mortality in evening types is consistent with previous reports of increased levels of cardiometabolic risk factors in this group. Mortality risk in evening types may be due to behavioural, psychological and physiological risk factors, many of which may be attributable to chronic misalignment between internal physiological timing and externally imposed timing of work and social activities. These findings suggest the need for researching possible interventions aimed at either modifying circadian rhythms in individuals or at allowing evening types greater working hour flexibility.

Health,"Do you mean home remedies for prostatitis?

Home remedies for prostatitis are optional, patients can choose different home remedies according to their situations.

• Drink a large amount of water: It helps to clear away harmful waste and toxins and keep the urinary tract clean. 
 
• Avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and caffeinated beverages: The symptoms will be exacerbated as these can irritate the prostate and bladder. 
 
• Consume tomatoes regularly: It contains antioxidants that help fight bacterial infection. It also contains bioflavonoid lycopene, which helps decrease the frequent urination. 
 
• Pumpkin seeds: They are rich in unsaturated fatty acids, which are vital for maintaining the health of the prostate.   
 
• Goldenseal: It has powerful antibacterial and antibiotic properties which can provide good benefits on reducing inflammations of prostate gland. 
 
• Carrot juice: It can help to absorb the lycopene in tomatoes and reduce the risk of prostate cancer. It is an excellent remedy to take it twice a day for prostatitis and other prostate diseases.  
 
• Sesames: Sesames are help in reducing the inflammation and relieve the symptoms of prostatitis. 
 
• Saw Palmetto: It is a herb that rich in phytosterols and fatty acids. Its anti-inflammatory properties can work well on alleviating the pain associated with prostatitis.

These are some of the options, prostatitis cannot be cured by home remedies only, patients still need to take medical treatment, Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill, a professional medicine in curing prostatitis, can help patients get rid of prostatitis effectively."

&gt; Infant and childhood food allergy, whose cause has long been a mystery, has now been linked to a mix of environmental and genetic factors that must coexist to trigger the allergy, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study.


&gt; The factors contributing to food allergy include the genetics that alter skin absorbency, use of infant cleansing wipes that leave soap on the skin, skin exposure to allergens in dust and skin exposure to food from those providing infant care. Food allergy is triggered when these factors occur together.

Mechanism for initiation of food allergy: Dependence on skin barrier mutations and environmental allergen costimulation. 

Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 2018; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.jaci.2018.02.003

Abstract:

&gt; Background

&gt; Mechanisms for the development of food allergy in neonates are unknown but clearly linked in patient populations to a genetic predisposition to skin barrier defects. Whether skin barrier defects contribute functionally to development of food allergy is unknown.

&gt; Objective

&gt; The purpose of the study was to determine whether skin barrier mutations, which are primarily heterozygous in patient populations, contribute to the development of food allergy.

&gt; Methods

&gt; Mice heterozygous for the filaggrin (Flg)ft and Tmem79ma mutations were skin sensitized with environmental and food allergens. After sensitization, mice received oral challenge with food allergen, and then inflammation, inflammatory mediators, and anaphylaxis were measured.

&gt; Results

&gt; We define development of inflammation, inflammatory mediators, and food allergen–induced anaphylaxis in neonatal mice with skin barrier mutations after brief concurrent cutaneous exposure to food and environmental allergens. Moreover, neonates of allergic mothers have increased responses to suboptimal sensitization with food allergens. Importantly, responses to food allergens by these neonatal mice were dependent on genetic defects in skin barrier function and on exposure to environmental allergens. ST2 blockade during skin sensitization inhibited the development of anaphylaxis, antigen-specific IgE, and inflammatory mediators. Neonatal anaphylactic responses and antigen-specific IgE were also inhibited by oral pre-exposure to food allergen, but interestingly, this was blunted by concurrent pre-exposure of the skin to environmental allergen.

&gt; Conclusion

&gt; These studies uncover mechanisms for food allergy sensitization and anaphylaxis in neonatal mice that are consistent with features of human early-life exposures and genetics in patients with clinical food allergy and demonstrate that changes in barrier function drive development of anaphylaxis to food allergen."

&gt; The State of US Health, 1990-2016


&gt; Results : Between 1990 and 2016, overall death rates in the United States declined from 745.2 (95% UI, 740.6 to 749.8) per 100 000 persons to 578.0 (95% UI, 569.4 to 587.1) per 100 000 persons. The probability of death among adults aged 20 to 55 years declined in 31 states and Washington, DC from 1990 to 2016. In 2016, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy at birth (81.3 years) and Mississippi had the lowest (74.7 years), a 6.6-year difference. Minnesota had the highest HALE at birth (70.3 years), and West Virginia had the lowest (63.8 years), a 6.5-year difference. The leading causes of DALYs in the United States for 1990 and 2016 were ischemic heart disease and lung cancer, while the third leading cause in 1990 was low back pain, and the third leading cause in 2016 was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Opioid use disorders moved from the 11th leading cause of DALYs in 1990 to the 7th leading cause in 2016, representing a 74.5% (95% UI, 42.8% to 93.9%) change. In 2016, each of the following 6 risks individually accounted for more than 5% of risk-attributable DALYs: tobacco consumption, high body mass index (BMI), poor diet, alcohol and drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high blood pressure. Across all US states, the top risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs were due to 1 of the 3 following causes: tobacco consumption (32 states), high BMI (10 states), or alcohol and drug use (8 states).

Holism as a general idea is to look at the whole thing, it contrasts to reductionism. Medicine has a tendency to get very reductionist.

My grandpa is 87 and he’s told me he lived 85 good years. For the past two years he has always said he’s doing terribly. He also doesn’t want to change his diet, so he’s probably not got much time left. The medication keeps him alive and takes his money, but he isn’t even enjoying life.

ABSTRACT

Objective/Background: The impact of midday napping on neurocognitive function in adolescents has not been well established. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between self-reported midday-napping behaviors and neurocognitive function in early adolescents. Participants: The sample was comprised of 363 early adolescents (12.00 ± 0.38 years old) from Jintan, China. Methods: Midday napping, nighttime sleep duration, and sleep quality were measured by self-reported questionnaires. Neurocognitive function was measured by the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (accuracy and reaction times). Generalized linear regression was used to analyze the relationships. Results: Sixty-four percent of our sample took more than 3 naps per week, and 70.11% reported nap durations of over 30 min. Participants with higher frequencies or longer durations of midday napping reported significantly better nighttime sleep quality (p &lt; 0.05). Adjusted models showed that frequent nappers (5–7d/week) were significantly associated with heightened accuracy on tasks that measured sustained attention and nonverbal reasoning and faster reaction times on spatial memory compared with other frequency groups (ps &lt; 0.05). For napping duration subgroups, early adolescents who took naps of any length were estimated to have faster reaction speeds on the sustained attention task compared with participants who never napped (ps &lt; 0.05). However, only nappers with a moderate duration (31–60 min) tended to achieve both faster speeds (β = −38.28, p = 0.02) and better accuracy (β = 3.90, p = 0.04) on the sustained attention task. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is an association between habitual midday napping and neurocognitive function in early adolescents, especially in China, where midday napping is a cultural practice."

Health,"That's largely because people are overweight and don't exercise but this certainly doesn't help. "
Health,"I am an undergraduate studying to prepare for medical school. Stories such as this are extremely discouraging for me looking at my future. The greed of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance companies has ruined the healthcare system of the United States. Problem is that this greed isn’t limited to healthcare, it is widespread throughout human civilization, but it is a bit more transparent here because people’s lives are directly on the line. Companies have no interest in helping you get better when they make more money when you are sick. What’s more, these companies control so much money in our economy that politicians will often be swayed to turn a blind eye to what they do. Look at the companies producing opioids. What’s more, look at our food industry. Greed beats ethical action every time."
Health,"The information is out there. You can find it if you look.  I don’t have some secret repository of information. It’s all out there.  Why would I lie about my experience to defend something that doesn’t work?   

Think about this: paying customers come to me for results.  We get results.  They’re delighted.  I get more referrals.  Those referrals get results. The results are predictable, according to homeopathic principles.  

Now, if you were looking for results, you’d look to where people are getting them, right?  

Here’s one to ponder: I had a Down’s syndrome patient that was brought to me.  Began homeopathic treatment (which amounted to a single remedy, repeated about 5 times over a year.  In that time her IQ increased and her facilities improved to the point where she moved out of the home into an apartment of her own.  Then, after another 6 months she was sprouting teeth that had never before been visualized on X-ray.  Wow.  Amazing result.  Delighted family.  

Here’s another to help you out: 
Gallstones in a 42yo female patient.  Thickened GB walls, inflamed, 10/10 pain.  Been to hospital, ultrasound findings described above, scheduled for surgery in 72 hours after liquid fast (standard procedure for surgery of this type).  Straight from hospital she comes to my office. I gave her Nux-vomica.  For the next two days no real improvement.  No noticeable change. Slightly better with the fast but still very uncomfortable.  So she comes back the morning of her scheduled surgery. I contact a colleague and describe the case.  She say “oh wow those symptoms are exactly like I had when I was an intern and had a GB attack.  I was prescribed Bryonia and it worked almost immediately. I still have my GB. “. So in office I give the patient Bryonia and in about 20 seconds she sits up straight, bends backwards to stretch her abdomen, and says “wow all the pain is gone!, is it supposed to work that fast?”  She kept her Gallbladder. 
Cases like this illustrate to me, in practice (and I have countless experiences like this), where I first give a “wrong” remedy and then give the “right” one.  It’s proof to me that yes, homeopathy doesn’t work if the remedy isn’t homeopathic to the case.  Homeopathy works on a very simple principle of physics: resonance.  I explain how it works to my patients like this: open up a piano and look at the strings. Then strike a tuning fork and pass it along the strings. Only the string that matches the tuning fork will begin to vibrate. The strings to the left and right will remain motionless. What we have done is, through resonance, delivered an exponentially increased amount of energy to that system (the string between the posts).  There are other modalities of treatment and diagnosis that use this simple principle. Think: NMR spectroscopy, light therapy, pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF), sound therapy.    "

Abstract

&gt; Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to small brain-like structures known as brain organoids offers an unprecedented opportunity to model human brain development and disease. To provide a vascularized and functional in vivo model of brain organoids, we established a method for transplanting human brain organoids into the adult mouse brain. Organoid grafts showed progressive neuronal differentiation and maturation, gliogenesis, integration of microglia, and growth of axons to multiple regions of the host brain. In vivo two-photon imaging demonstrated functional neuronal networks and blood vessels in the grafts. Finally, in vivo extracellular recording combined with optogenetics revealed intragraft neuronal activity and suggested graft-to-host functional synaptic connectivity. This combination of human neural organoids and an in vivo physiological environment in the animal brain may facilitate disease modeling under physiological conditions."

Government and independent scientists have scrutinized thousands of those chemicals in recent decades, and identified hundreds associated with a risk of cancer and other diseases at small concentrations in drinking water, according to an analysis of government records by The New York Times.

As we test for more and more stuff, we will keep finding weird things in our food and water.

&gt; Sitting is Bad for Your Brain, Not Just Your Heart or Metabolism


&gt; Summary: A new study reports people who sit down too much during middle to older age show signs of thinning in the medial temporal cortex, an area of the brain associated with the formation of new memories.


&gt; Sitting too much is linked to changes in a section of the brain that is critical for memory, according to a preliminary study by UCLA researchers of middle-aged and older adults.

Abstract

&gt; Atrophy of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) occurs with aging, resulting in impaired episodic memory. Aerobic fitness is positively correlated with total hippocampal volume, a heavily studied memory-critical region within the MTL. However, research on associations between sedentary behavior and MTL subregion integrity is limited. Here we explore associations between thickness of the MTL and its subregions (namely CA1, CA23DG, fusiform gyrus, subiculum, parahippocampal, perirhinal and entorhinal cortex,), physical activity, and sedentary behavior. We assessed 35 non-demented middle-aged and older adults (25 women, 10 men; 45–75 years) using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire for older adults, which quantifies physical activity levels in MET-equivalent units and asks about the average number of hours spent sitting per day. All participants had high resolution MRI scans performed on a Siemens Allegra 3T MRI scanner, which allows for detailed investigation of the MTL. Controlling for age, total MTL thickness correlated inversely with hours of sitting/day (r = -0.37, p = 0.03). In MTL subregion analysis, parahippocampal (r = -0.45, p = 0.007), entorhinal (r = -0.33, p = 0.05) cortical and subiculum (r = -0.36, p = .04) thicknesses correlated inversely with hours of sitting/day. No significant correlations were observed between physical activity levels and MTL thickness. Though preliminary, our results suggest that more sedentary non-demented individuals have less MTL thickness. Future studies should include longitudinal analyses and explore mechanisms, as well as the efficacy of decreasing sedentary behaviors to reverse this association.

And, according to that report, the biggest reason that they've had so much success is because:

&gt; ITNs are the cornerstone of malaria prevention efforts, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the last 5 years, the use of treated nets in the region has increased significantly: in 2015, an estimated 53% of the population at risk slept under a treated net compared to 30% in 2010.
&gt;Other regions have achieved impressive reductions in their malaria burden. Since 2010, the malaria mortality rate declined by 58% in the Western Pacific Region, by 46% in the South-East Asia Region, by 37% in the Region of the Americas and by 6% in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. In 2015, the European Region was malaria-free: all 53 countries in the region reported at least 1 year of zero locally-acquired cases of malaria."

It’s like this: you don’t fault the laws of aerodynamics when a plane crashes. Rather you consider it was the inappropriate application of the law...the plane failed.  In cases where homeopathy fails, it’s merely because the medicine given wasn’t appropriate.  Homeopathy works on a principle of resonance.

These studies are also really difficult to interpret because it's tough to determine if the cause is more produce or less of something else, or both.

Self-Condensation Culture Enables Vascularization of Tissue Fragments for Efficient Therapeutic Transplantation

Takahashi, Yoshinobu et al.

Cell Reports , Volume 23 , Issue 6 , 1620 - 1629

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.123 

Link: https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)30499-6

Highlights

•Self-condensation culture enables endothelialization of diverse tissue fragments
•Vascularization facilitates tissue survival after transplantation
•Vascularized islet transplant enhances therapeutic potential against diabetes
•Rapid induction of functional vasculatures preserves original islet architecture

Summary

Clinical transplantation of tissue fragments, including islets, faces a critical challenge because of a lack of effective strategies that ensure efficient engraftment through the timely integration of vascular networks. We recently developed a complex organoid engineering method by “self-condensation” culture based on mesenchymal cell-dependent contraction, thereby enabling dissociated heterotypic lineages including endothelial cells to self-organize in a spatiotemporal manner. Here, we report the successful adaptation of this method for generating complex tissues from diverse tissue fragments derived from various organs, including pancreatic islets. The self-condensation of human and mouse islets with endothelial cells not only promoted functionalization in culture but also massively improved post-transplant engraftment. Therapeutically, fulminant diabetic mice were more efficiently treated by a vascularized islet transplant compared with the conventional approach. Given the general limitations of post-transplant vascularization associated with 3D tissue-based therapy, our approach offers a promising means of enhancing efficacy in the context of therapeutic tissue transplantation.

&gt; BACKGROUND: Sports drinks are aggressively marketed to teenagers to replenish fluids and/or electrolytes. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, typical adolescent physical activity does not require sports drink rehydration. 


&gt; CONCLUSIONS: Although daily consumption of sports drinks has decreased overall, sugar-sweetened sports drinks remain popular, with the majority of high school students drinking them at least weekly. Of concern, daily consumption increased among teenagers watching television &gt;2 hours per day.

Health,"&gt;What dangers?

One that I have not seen addressed properly is a basic one: lung damage and risk of lung cancer.

People often point to weed and suggest that it's less dangerous than cigarettes. But there's an important qualification that's almost never brought up, and as far as I can tell, has not been well researched.

Smoke for smoke-- 1:1, pot vs. tobacco-- what is the relative risk of smoking pot versus tobacco?

Studies have mostly not been able to address this as far as I can tell. You basically need a statistically robust sample of people who either smoke as many joints as another group does of cigarettes in a day-- and who have done it for long enough to create an actual significant risk factor-- or you need a similarly designed setup of people smoking as few cigarettes per day as another group smoking joints.

Given the longer-lasting effects of pot, I'd say the better design would be to compare moderate smokers-- say, 1-3 cigarettes per day-- to people who smoke 1-3 joints per day (or the equivalent).

Sadly, it is probably an almost impossible task to assemble such a group currently. It may be that such a comparison is not possible at this time due to the differences in the substances' legalities. We need a few decades of recreational smoking legality for weed, I suspect, before it's possible to pull together a statistically robust sample, let along multiple samples.

So the potential dangers-- and true comparability-- of tobacco and weed have not been adequately explored.

Instead, we get studies saying that pot smoking doesn't cause as much damage / isn't as risky as cigarette smoking, never mind that these studies are forced to compare people who smoke multiple cigarettes per day to people who might smoke weed once or twice a day.

That's not a robust comparison. And it's inappropriate to point to weed-only smokers with a lower incidence of lung cancers and say categorically that weed is less risky than tobacco, because we can't actually say that based on the existing data.

This is something that is conspicuously ignored by pro-weed folks, and pointing it out on Reddit in threads on the subject is almost always a ticket to universal, and heavy, downvoting.

**Edit:** Immediately downvoted. Care to explain what's bad about wanting robust science? Please note that this is not an anti-weed post here. It's just pointing out that as far as I can tell, the science just isn't there at this point to address this."

Health,"Alright so I’m going to make a TLDR for this article and run through a couple other negatives we’ve learned through research.  Keep in mind, I am totally for full legalization. 

The article:  
Marijuana can have permanent/long term negative effects on the brain chemistry of adolescents.   There may be some epigenetic effects of smoking marijuana, but it’s too soon to tell.  

To those who disagree with the article: 
I strongly support the ability to recreationally use marijuana as adults, but even if one has smoked as an adolescent, it does not negate this research.  Large volumes of research state: adolescent brain + drugs = not great news for their brain chemistry.  Kids shouldn’t be smoking pot.  Nor should they be drinking.  I don’t (personal opinion) think children should be prescribed adderall until 18 unless it is an extreme case.  Mind altering drugs are not good for a developing brain (which is developing until 25). 

Other negative effects:

1.  Those that are predisposed to psychosis or developing schizophrenia:  this has the potential to trigger these conditions.

2.  Getting high greatly reduces REM sleep.  This is fundamental to memory, energy levels, I think hormonal regulation as well ( don’t quote me on that last bit).  Point is, REM sleep is very important. 

So where does this leave us?

1.  Don’t give weed to adolescents

2a.  Don’t smoke high THC weed every day.  Losing one night of REM sleep won’t be the end of the world, and the following night one will have rebound REM sleep (look it up).  It is not equivalent to a good nights rest, but I’m trying to strike a balance. 

2b.  Smoking medical weed ie. Primarily very high CBD and low THC daily might not affect your REM sleep.  I have zero research to support this; however, it appears from people that use CBD isolate and other products that their sleep remains unaffected.  However this is anecdotal so take this with a large handful of salt.

Finally:
We need more research.  Descheduling cannabis would allow for a lot more quality research to occur. 

That’s my two cents.  I’d love to have a discussion with you all. "

Abstract

The present study examined 1) whether the associations between cannabis use (CU) age of onset and drug abuse by 28 y remain when controlling for risk factors in childhood, adolescence and early adulthood; and 2) the developmental pathways from early risk factors to drug abuse problems. Participants from a longitudinal sample of boys of low socioeconomic status (N = 1,030) were followed from 6 to 28 y. We examined the self-reported CU onset between the ages of 13 and 17 y and drug abuse symptoms by 28 y. The odds of developing any drug abuse symptoms by 28 y were reduced by 31% for each year of delayed CU onset (OR = 0.69). Cannabis, alcohol and other drug frequency at 17 y mediated this association. Still, even when taking that frequency of use into account, adolescents who started using cannabis before 15 y were at a higher risk of developing drug abuse symptoms by age 28 y. Significant indirect effects were found from early adolescent delinquency and affiliation with deviant friends to drug abuse symptoms at 28 y through CU age of onset and substance use frequency at 17 y. The results suggest more clearly than before that prevention programs should aim at delaying CU onset to prevent or reduce drug abuse in adulthood. Furthermore, prevention programs targeting delinquency and/or affiliation with deviant friends in childhood or early adolescence could indirectly reduce substance abuse in adulthood without addressing substance use specifically."
Health,"South Korea, which has the highest suicide rate among children and teens, shows that there is a correlation between increased pressure to succeed in school driven by the parents and the high suicide rate.

Health,"To anyone dealing with having to get a hernia repaired, 'The Shouldice Hospital' in Toronto is world reknown for their technique of sewing closed using a steel suture, hernias \(of all sorts\).  

Had an inguinal hernia that was not so painful but large, they repaired it with no problem, besides my insurance being A\-holes and giving me nothing towards it, denying my claim...  It cost me $6,000 plus the flight which was a few hundred more ...ugh/sigh...  but in the end all has been good \(at least 3 years later, at this point\).  There was talk that I had another on the opposite side, but it's not showing nor pain that I'm aware of, so it'll wait or never happen.

The deal is you fly in, check in Monday, have your repair Tue or Wed morning, and leave Friday.  Being there those first 48\-72 hrs after, allows for the necessary recovery procedures, so that chances are very low that after you leave there'll be any big issues.  Of course, one has to give it time and there are some important steps that one have to abide by for a while.

Also, before you go there, they will tell you basically what weight you have to be below, based on some info like your height.  I had to be below 175lb they said when I first called, I was 190 and worked hard to not eat as much and to eat the right stuff, succeeded \(had not been below 190 in over 15 years at that point, was a good thing even though it was hard.

Health,"&gt;The big unknown is cardiovascular risk. I get your point that studies haven’t adequately accounted for heavy cannabis smoking, but the current evidence suggests that tobacco and lung cancer is clearly linked while no such link has been found between cannabis smoking and lung cancer.

This is because really solid data simply aren't there.

&gt;Please see the National Academy of Sciences’ report on cannabis from 2017 where they indicate a moderate amount of evidence exists that there is no statistical correlation between cannabis smoking and lung cancer. Heavy use isn’t as accounted for, but I’m pretty sure tobacco showed increased risk in a linear relationship in similar case control studies.

Here's what the report indicated under ""challenges and barriers in conducting cannabis research.""

&gt;For instance, specific regulatory barriers, including the classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance, impede the advancement of research.  Researchers also often find it difficult to gain access to the quantity, quality, and type of cannabis product necessary to address specific research questions.  The committee said a diverse network of funders is needed to support cannabis and cannabinoid research.

There's a lot to unpack there, but the bottom line is this: the data aren't there currently. There are no long-term studies in existence that have the ability to address the question. A statistical correlation (or lack thereof) when you have lousy or incomplete data doesn't say anything. It's *critical* that this kind of information be gathered. Until it is, the following applies:

**absence of evidence does not indicate evidence of absence.**

&gt;Also it should be clearly stated that someone that smokes 1-3 joints a day is a heavy cannabis smoker, so your comparison is inaccurate. That is not a moderate user and only a small fraction of cannabis consumers smoke that much. In fact many don’t smoke at all. They eat or vape.

Okay, well then let's talk about moderate users, and compare *them* 1:1 with tobacco users at similar levels of use. The big talking point from many cannabis advocates is that tobacco is linked to lung cancer while cannabis smoking is not. But it's flawed because the data aren't there. So those are data that are needed. And building an argument that cannabis is ""safe"" because smokers don't seem to get lung cancer at the same rate as cigarette smokers is equally flawed because it implies (in making the argument) that it's been statistically evaluated. And it really hasn't, when you look at what's out there.

&gt;One other note of agreement that people that are thinking cannabis smoking is harmless are wrong. We have basically gone from thinking cannabis is no different from meth to thinking it is harmless. It is harmful, it’s just less so than alcohol or tobacco.

I absolutely agree that it's harmful. I also agree that it's not as dangerous as it's been made out to be, or that its current classification as a Schedule 1 controlled substance would have us believe.

But again, lacking the data, it's not technically correct to state that it's ""less dangerous"" than alcohol or tobacco.

I would like for it to turn out to be safer. But until the data are there, I don't think it's appropriate to make that statement. We need data specifically on cannabis use at levels comparable to current alcohol and tobacco use. That may take a while."

&gt; UCI researchers identify blood biomarkers that may help diagnose, confirm concussions


&gt; Researchers from the University of California, Irvine, Georgetown University and the University of Rochester have found that specific small molecules in blood plasma may be useful in determining whether someone has sustained a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly known as a concussion.

Plasma metabolomic biomarkers accurately classify acute mild traumatic brain injury from controls.

Abstract

&gt; Past and recent attempts at devising objective biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid have focused on abundance measures of time-dependent proteins. Similar independent determinants would be most welcome in diagnosing the most common form of TBI, mild TBI (mTBI), which remains difficult to define and confirm based solely on clinical criteria. There are currently no consensus diagnostic measures that objectively define individuals as having sustained an acute mTBI. Plasma metabolomic analyses have recently evolved to offer an alternative to proteomic analyses, offering an orthogonal diagnostic measure to what is currently available. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a developed set of metabolomic biomarkers is able to objectively classify college athletes sustaining mTBI from non-injured teammates, within 6 hours of trauma and whether such a biomarker panel could be effectively applied to an independent cohort of TBI and control subjects.


&gt; A 6-metabolite panel was developed from biomarkers that had their identities confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in our Athlete cohort. These biomarkers were defined at ≤6 hours following mTBI and objectively classified mTBI athletes from teammate controls, and provided similar classification of these groups at the 2, 3, and 7 days post-mTBI. The same 6-metabolite panel, when applied to a separate, independent cohort provided statistically similar results despite major differences between the two cohorts. Our confirmed plasma biomarker panel objectively classifies acute mTBI cases from controls within 6 hours of injury in our two independent cohorts. While encouraged by our initial results, we expect future studies to expand on these initial observations.

&gt; Although information is anonymized, data miners and brokers can build up detailed dossiers on individual patients by cross-referencing with other sources

&gt; Your medical data is for sale – all of it. Adam Tanner, a fellow at Harvard’s institute for quantitative social science and author of a new book on the topic, Our Bodies, Our Data, said that patients generally don’t know that their most personal information – what diseases they test positive for, what surgeries they have had – is the stuff of multibillion-dollar business.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-data-brokers-make-money-off-your-medical-records :

&gt; The dominant player in the medical-data-trading industry is IMS Health, which recorded $2.6 billion in revenue in 2014. 

&gt; Three quarters of all retail pharmacies in the U.S. send some portion of their electronic records to IMS. All told, the company says it has assembled half a billion dossiers on individual patients from the U.S. to Australia.

Food that can help improve prostatitis symptoms

. Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. Go for those with deep, bright color.

 . Choose whole-grain bread instead of white bread, and choose whole-grain pasta and cereals.

 . Limit the consumption of red meat, including beef, pork, lamb, and goat, and processed meats, such as bologna and hot dogs. Fish, skinless poultry, beans, and eggs are healthier sources of protein.

 . Choose healthful fats, such as olive oil, nuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans), and avocados. Limit saturated fats from dairy and other animal products. Avoid partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats), which are in many fast foods and packaged foods.

 . Avoid sugar-sweetened drinks, such as sodas and many fruit juices. Eat sweets as an occasional treat.

 . Cut down on salt. Choose foods low in sodium by reading and comparing food labels. Limit the use of canned, processed, and frozen foods.

 
. Watch portion sizes. Eat slowly, and stop eating when you are full.

Dietary therapy can only be an assistant treatment for prostatitis, patients need to take medical help for an accurate cure, Chinese herbal medicine Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill works well in curing chronic prostatitis, is a perfect choice for sufferers.​​​​​​​"

Health,"the cause of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis still remains unknown, the following factors will increase the rate of getting chronic non-bacterial prostatitis:
 
1. A blockage of the flow of urine and hold urine. The theoretical basis of these two factors is the same. Too much urine in the bladder will lead to urine reflux and damage organs like kidney and ureter. Holding too much urine will result in over-swelling of prostate to cause prostatitis.  
 
2. Drinking alcohol and staying out. These two habits will damage the immune system of the human body. Shing Mun disaster brought disaster to pool fish, once the immune system of a man is damaged, his prostate will be attracted by prostatitis easier.
 
3. Microorganisms from sexually transmitted diseases(STDs) like chlamydia may cause chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. Although chronic non-bacterial prostatitis is not a sexually transmitted disease, the STDs microorganisms will cause this disease if the STDs doesn't get treated timely.
 
4. Sedentary and cycling put men in the risk of getting chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. Sedentary and cycling will produce pressure of the prostate to cause over-swelling of the prostate like holding urine.
 
Chronic prostatitis is difficult to be cured but it doesn't mean it cannot be cured.

Long-term Treatment with Low-Dose Caffeine Worsens BPSD-Like Profile in 3xTg-AD Mice Model of Alzheimer’s Disease and Affects Mice with Normal Aging.

Abstract:

&gt; Coffee or caffeine has recently been suggested as prophylaxis for dementia. Although memory problems are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, this dementia is also characterized by neuropsychiatric symptoms called Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD). The impact of preventive/therapeutic strategies on both cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms can be addressed in the 3xTg-AD mice, since they exhibit cognitive but also BPSD-like profiles. Here, we studied the long-term effects of a low dose of caffeine in male 3xTg-AD mice and as compared to age-matched non-transgenic (NTg) counterparts with normal aging. Animals were treated (water or caffeine in drinking water) from adulthood (6 months of age) until middle-aged (13 months of age), that in 3xTg-AD mice correspond to onset of cognitive impairment and advanced stages, respectively. The low caffeine dosing used (0.3 mg/ml) was previously found to give a plasma concentration profile in mice roughly equivalent to that of a human coffee drinker. There were significant effects of caffeine on most behavioral variables, especially those related to neophobia and other anxiety-like behaviors, emotionality, and cognitive flexibility. The 3xTg-AD and NTg mice were differently influenced by caffeine. Overall, the increase of neophobia and other anxiety-related behaviors resulted in an exacerbation of BPSD-like profile in 3xTg-AD mice. Learning and memory, strongly influenced by anxiety in 3xTg-AD mice, got little benefit from caffeine, only shown after a detailed analysis of navigation strategies. The worsened pattern in NTg mice and the use of search strategies in 3xTg-AD mice make both groups more similar. Circadian motor activity showed genotype differences, which were found to be enhanced by caffeine. Selective effects of caffeine on NTg were found in the modulation of behaviors related to emotional profile and risk assessment. Caffeine normalized splenomegaly of 3xTg-AD mice, a physical indicator of their impaired peripheral immune system, and trended to increase their corticosterone levels. Our observations of adverse caffeine effects in an Alzheimer’s disease model together with previous clinical observations suggest that an exacerbation of BPSD-like symptoms may partly interfere with the beneficial cognitive effects of caffeine. These results are relevant when coffee-derived new potential treatments for dementia are to be devised and tested."

Health,"I disagree with the notion of trying to develop drugs when an inherent mechanism already exists.

Our bodies are an extremely complex network of specifically timed and regulated chemical reactions. When you throw a bulk quantity of a drug into that mix, the body has to react in bulk. Some of the drug produces the intended reaction, while the rest of it is dealt with by the body. In the mean time, the body also has to deal with being side-blinded by a reaction that - as far as it knows - it never intended to happen. It never had time to set the stage for that reaction and won’t be able to issue that reaction in a controlled and timed manner to work in concert with other reactions it might have issued naturally. This is how side effects happen.

Drugs are rather reckless, in my opinion, when there are appropriate pathways to create an effect by circumstance.

Drugs are like trying to paint a window frame red by filling a fire truck with red paint and aiming the hose at the house."

Health,"I have no doubt that you saved lives with medication, I’m sure thousands can benefit as you say. 

Help me unpack this if you will:

&gt;The health care system also may contribute to poor health through its adverse effects. For example, US estimates8-10 of the combined effect of errors and adverse effects that occur because of iatrogenic dam- age not associated with recognizable error include:

• 12000 deaths/year from unnecessary surgery


• 7000 deaths/year from medication errors in hospitals • 20000 deaths/year from other errors in hospitals

• 80000 deaths/year from nosocomial infections in hospitals


• 106000 deaths/year from nonerror, adverse effects of medications


&gt;These total to 225000 deaths per year from iatrogenic causes. Three caveats should be noted. First, most of the data are derived from studies in hospitalized patients. Second, these estimates are for deaths only and **do not include adverse effects that are associated with disability or discomfort.** Third, the estimates of death due to error are **lower than those in the IOM report**.1 If the higher estimates are used, the deaths due to iatrogenic causes would range from 230 000 to 284 000. In any case, 225 000 deaths per year constitutes the third leading cause of death in the United States, after deaths from heart disease and cancer. Even if these figures are overestimated, there is a wide margin between these numbers of deaths and the next leading cause of death (cerebrovascular disease).


&gt;One analysis overcomes some of these limitations by estimating adverse effects in outpatient care and including adverse effects other than death.11 It concluded that between 4% and 18% of consecutive patients experience adverse effects in outpatient settings, with 116 million extra physician visits, 77 million extra prescriptions, 17 million emergency department visits, 8 million hospitalizations, 3 million long-term admissions, 199000 additional deaths, and $77 billion in extra costs (equivalent to the aggregate cost of care of patients with diabetes).11

Health,"Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis (CNP), which is also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome, is an inflammation in prostate that causes pain and other discomforts. This chronic condition may increase the risk of male infertility since the prostate fluids that secreted by prostate is the main component of semen.

The goal of treatment is to help improve symptoms. Though antibiotics are commonly used to treat prostatitis, it’s controversial when doctors prescribe antibiotics for patients with CNP. Some doctors don’t give antibiotics because this condition is considered as chronic and not due to an infection. Some doctors think antibiotics could treat an infection that is difficult to find in urine. 

Herbal medicine is greater than antibiotics in the cure of CNP since it has no side effects during the long-term treatment. Compared with other herbal medicines, Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill is proven to be the most effective in treating CNP. This herbal medicine is made from more than 50 types of natural herbs which has many functions that aim at eliminating the symptoms. To relieve the pain associated with this chronic condition, it was added with herbs that can improve the blood and Qi flow, and dissolve the blood stasis. It also contains herbs with the properties of clearing away heat and toxins and inducing diuresis to relieve stranguria. Thus, the urinary symptoms can be alleviated greatly.

&gt;  A new type of cancer vaccine has yielded promising results in an initial clinical trial conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. The personalized vaccine is made from patients’ own immune cells, which are exposed in the laboratory to the contents of the patients’ tumor cells, and then injected into the patients to initiate a wider immune response. The trial, conducted in advanced ovarian cancer patients, was a pilot trial aimed primarily at determining safety and feasibility, but there were clear signs that it could be effective: About half of the vaccinated patients showed signs of anti-tumor T-cell responses, and those “responders” tended to live much longer without tumor progression than those who didn’t respond. One patient, after two years of vaccinations, was disease-free for another five years without further treatment. The study is published today in Science Translational Medicine.

The personalized touch in cancer vaccination

&gt; Transfer of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) has been investigated as a method of boosting T cell responses in therapeutic vaccines for several diseases. Tanyi et al. report the findings of a clinical study involving recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Patient DCs were pulsed with oxidized tumor lysate before transfer and given alone or in combination with immunomodulatory drugs. The DC vaccine was well tolerated and induced potent antitumor T cell responses, including to new epitopes, that correlated with better prognosis. These results suggest further testing of this vaccination regimen for inducing protective T cell immunity in cancer.

Abstract

&gt; We conducted a pilot clinical trial testing a personalized vaccine generated by autologous dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with oxidized autologous whole-tumor cell lysate (OCDC), which was injected intranodally in platinum-treated, immunotherapy-naïve, recurrent ovarian cancer patients. OCDC was administered alone (cohort 1, n = 5), in combination with bevacizumab (cohort 2, n = 10), or bevacizumab plus low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (cohort 3, n = 10) until disease progression or vaccine exhaustion. A total of 392 vaccine doses were administered without serious adverse events. Vaccination induced T cell responses to autologous tumor antigen, which were associated with significantly prolonged survival. Vaccination also amplified T cell responses against mutated neoepitopes derived from nonsynonymous somatic tumor mutations, and this included priming of T cells against previously unrecognized neoepitopes, as well as novel T cell clones of markedly higher avidity against previously recognized neoepitopes. We conclude that the use of oxidized whole-tumor lysate DC vaccine is safe and effective in eliciting a broad antitumor immunity, including private neoantigens, and warrants further clinical testing."

Summary

Background

Potentially untreatable Plasmodium falciparum malaria threatens the Greater Mekong subregion. A previous series of pilot projects in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam suggested that mass drug administration was safe, and when added to provision of early diagnosis and treatment, could reduce the reservoir of P falciparum and interrupts transmission. We examined the effects of a scaled-up programme of this strategy in four townships of eastern Myanmar on the incidence of P falciparum malaria.

Methods

The programme was implemented in the four townships of Myawaddy, Kawkareik, Hlaingbwe, and Hpapun in Kayin state, Myanmar. Increased access to early diagnosis and treatment of malaria was provided to all villages through community-based malaria posts equipped with rapid diagnostic tests, and treatment with artemether–lumefantrine plus single low-dose primaquine. Villages were identified as malarial hotspots (operationally defined as &gt;40% malaria, of which 20% was P falciparum) with surveys using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR either randomly or targeted at villages where the incidence of clinical cases of P falciparum malaria remained high (ie, &gt;100 cases per 1000 individuals per year) despite a functioning malaria post. During each survey, a 2 mL sample of venous blood was obtained from randomly selected adults. Hotspots received targeted mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus single-dose primaquine once per month for 3 consecutive months in addition to the malaria posts. The main outcome was the change in village incidence of clinical P falciparum malaria, quantified using a multivariate, generalised, additive multilevel model. Malaria prevalence was measured in the hotspots 12 months after mass drug administration.

Findings

Between May 1, 2014, and April 30, 2017, 1222 malarial posts were opened, providing early diagnosis and treatment to an estimated 365 000 individuals. Incidence of P falciparum malaria decreased by 60 to 98% in the four townships. 272 prevalence surveys were undertaken and 69 hotspot villages were identified. By April 2017, 50 hotspots were treated with mass drug administration. Hotspot villages had a three times higher incidence of P falciparum at malarial posts than neighbouring villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2·7, 95% CI 1·8–4·4). Early diagnosis and treatment was associated with a significant decrease in P falciparum incidence in hotspots (IRR 0·82, 95% CI 0·76–0·88 per quarter) and in other villages (0·75, 0·73–0·78 per quarter). Mass drug administration was associated with a five-times decrease in P falciparum incidence within hotspot villages (IRR 0·19, 95% CI 0·13–0·26). By April, 2017, 965 villages (79%) of 1222 corresponding to 104 village tracts were free from P falciparum malaria for at least 6 months. The prevalence of wild-type genotype for K13 molecular markers of artemisinin resistance was stable over the three years (39%; 249/631).

Interpretation

Providing early diagnosis and effective treatment substantially decreased village-level incidence of artemisinin-resistant P falciparum malaria in hard-to-reach, politically sensitive regions of eastern Myanmar. Targeted mass drug administration significantly reduced malaria incidence in hotspots. If these activities could proceed in all contiguous endemic areas in addition to standard control programmes already implemented, there is a possibility of subnational elimination of P falciparum.

Abstract

&gt; Efforts to develop drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have shown promise in animal studies, only to fail in human trials, suggesting a pressing need to study AD in human model systems. Using human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), a variant of the APOE gene product and the major genetic risk factor for AD, we demonstrated that ApoE4-expressing neurons had higher levels of tau phosphorylation, unrelated to their increased production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, and that they displayed GABAergic neuron degeneration. ApoE4 increased Aβ production in human, but not in mouse, neurons. Converting ApoE4 to ApoE3 by gene editing rescued these phenotypes, indicating the specific effects of ApoE4. Neurons that lacked APOE behaved similarly to those expressing ApoE3, and the introduction of ApoE4 expression recapitulated the pathological phenotypes, suggesting a gain of toxic effects from ApoE4. Treatment of ApoE4-expressing neurons with a small-molecule structure corrector ameliorated the detrimental effects, thus showing that correcting the pathogenic conformation of ApoE4 is a viable therapeutic approach for ApoE4-related AD."

&gt;A 1985 landmark report on nutrition in medical schools by the National Academy of Sciences found that on average, future physicians received 21 hours of nutrition instruction over four years. Medical students need at least 25 hours to be adequately prepared to help patients, the report concluded.

&gt;Yet more than two decades later, nutrition education in U.S. medical schools remains inadequate, according to a 2010 study led by Adams and her UNC colleagues and published in the journal Academic Medicine.

&gt;On average, doctors receive 19 hours of total nutrition education in medical school; in 2004 the average was 22.3 hours, according to the study, conducted as part of the Nutrition in Medicine project at UNC. In 2009, 27 percent of the schools met the minimum standard of nutrition training, compared with 38 percent in 2004.

&gt;Years later, as a newly minted doctor on the wards seeing real patients, I found myself in the same position. I was still getting a lot of questions about food and diet. And I was still hesitating when answering. I wasn’t sure I knew that much more after medical school than I did before.

&gt;One day I mentioned this uncomfortable situation to another young doctor. “Just consult the dietitians if you have a problem,” she said after listening to my confession. “They’ll take care of it.” She paused for a moment, looked suspiciously around the nursing station, then leaned over and whispered, “I know we’re supposed to know about nutrition and diet, but none of us really does.”

"
Health,"No, the person you are responding to is correct. You have to remember that if a doctor graduates from med school at 25, they have 40 years of practice ahead of them, sometimes more. In 1975 the state of medical education was very different and doctors don't always study, remember, or use the full spectrum of treatment options.

How did you know the corn was GMO? Also how did GMO wheat give you stomach problems when there is no commercially available GMO wheat on the market?

    1-tablespoon tomato paste
    Sea salt to taste
    Grated Parmesan or pecorino to serve
    Fresh chopped parsley to serve

ZUCCHINI SPAGHETTI

    800g (28 1/4 oz) zucchini
    2 handfuls baby spinach leaves
    2 tablespoons pesto (See recipe below)

PESTO

    60g (2 oz) basil leaves, chopped
    60 g (2 oz) parsley leaves, chopped
    1 clove garlic, smashed
    2 tablespoons roasted walnuts, chopped
    2 tablespoons parmesan, grated
    1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
    60 ml (2 fl oz) extra virgin olive oil

    While the bolognese is cooking prepare your pesto and zucchini noodles

TO MAKE THE PESTO
Combine pesto ingredients into a food processor or blender for 1 minute until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking. Alternatively, chop dry ingredients by hand using a large chef’s knife or Mezzaluna chopper then combine in a bowl with the olive oil, lemon and garlic.

TO MAKE ZUCCHINI NOODLES

    Run the zucchini along a mandolin to form nice long spaghetti strips, or alternatively use a julienne slicer

Summary

Utilizing a multi‐method design, the present study examined the association between maternal sleep, assessed via actigraphy and self‐reports, and permissive parenting (e.g. lax, inconsistent discipline) during adolescence, as well as the extent to which this association differed by mothers’ race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The sample was comprised of 234 mothers (M age = 41.76 years, SD = 6.25; 67% European‐American, 31% African‐American, 2% other race/ethnicities) and 237 adolescents (113 boys, 124 girls; M age = 15.80 years, SD = 0.80; 66% European‐American, 34% African‐American). Mothers’ sleep duration (actual sleep minutes) and quality (sleep efficiency, latency, long wake episodes) were assessed using actigraphy. Mothers also reported on their sleep problems and adolescents reported on mothers’ permissive parenting behaviours. Results revealed that actigraphy‐based longer sleep duration and shorter sleep latency were associated with lower levels of permissive parenting. Further, mothers’ race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status moderated the association between actigraphy‐based sleep quality (i.e. sleep efficiency, long wake episodes) and permissive parenting. Specifically, a negative association between sleep efficiency and permissive parenting was evident only for African‐American mothers. In addition, a positive association between more frequent night wakings and permissive parenting was evident only for mothers from lower socioeconomic status households. The findings highlight the benefits of longer and higher‐quality sleep for reducing the risk of permissive parenting, especially among ethnic minority mothers and mothers from lower socioeconomic status households.

Health,"You need to do more research. T2 diabetics are not treated exclusively with insulin therapy, as they have developed a high insulin tolerance. The treatment talked about in the article is clearly for T1 diabetics (a genetic condition triggered by a virus, not lifestyle) because they do not produce their own insulin due to their immune system having rendered the pancreas inactive.

Also, you listed Alzheimer's as a lifestyle disease. It isn't, it's genetic. There are things you can do to lower your odds of it developing, but it's largely determined by genetics. Not lifestyle, and certainly not diet.

Also, weight? Not the defining criteria for developing cancer. Not even close. Actually, old age is a far better indicator than weight in developing cancer. If you love long enough, you will develope cancer. Just saying.

As for Big Pharma getting people hooked on pills? You are placing blame in the wrong place. Pharmacies only fill the perscriotions that DOCTORS write. So place some blame on the people over prescribing narcotics.

Also, you say we aren't doing shit. If that is true, where is the research coming from? The statistics? How have we even compliled information to determine that there is a problem (because the first step to solving a problem is defining what the problem is)?

And after that, what about free will? You stated that millions of people die due to their dietary choices. The key word there is CHOICES. We are fortunate enough to be able to make our own choices, right or wrong.

Given your complaint about the healthcare system, I'd guess that you are in the US. Yes, our healthcare system is broken. It needs to be fixed. As somebody who pays actually pays taxes (which at the age of 15, it is highly unlikely that you do), I have more problems with the way tax and social security money is misused than with subsidized healthcare. I say this as some of who has at different points had no health insurance, bad insurance, and good insurance. I would rather see somebody get medical care for injurey they did to themselves and have the chance to learn from their mistakes, than to see them die from something medical intervention could cure.

As far as I can tell he has lowered our taxes (actually benefited the lower and upper middle class more than the rich), cut down tons of unnecessary government oversight and regulations thus expediting the process of government and reducing government where it shouldn't be in the first place, beat the shit out of ISIS (they lost 98% of their territory since he has been president) when previous president(s) told us ISIS was here to stay, removed the horrendous OBAMACARE mandate where you had to pay a fine if you didn't buy insurance (hopefully he can open up buying across state lines as well), promoted women in the military (not misogynistic as CNN would have people believe), record unemployment numbers (3.9%) which was considered unfeasible in the near future, reduced black and hispanic unemployment to record lows, loves and supports our constitution (especially the 2nd amendment), resulted in record highs for the stock market since he became president (coincidence? I think not), been the only president to be actually tough on Russia by imposing sanctions and initiating missile strikes in Syria inspite of Russian warnings, the only president to take on China in terms of the trade war (and winning), the only president to call on unfair trade and contribution practices of the EU, has resulted in significantly lower ILLEGAL immigration numbers since taking office, brought back thousands of manufacturing jobs in the US (when Obama told us those jobs are not coming back and Trump doesn't have a magic wand to bring them back), resulted in extremely significantly increasing the busts of pedophile and human trafficking rings, he is the only one who gives a shit about the men in blue and the border security and out military in a long time, he has actually brought Kim Jong Un and Moon to the same table (who would've thought he could have done that, with just his tweets, not less), he doesn't even expect a Nobel Peace Prize for that (they gave one to Obama just for being Obama while he proceeded to drop over 26000 bombs on civilians and weaponized the FBI and the IRS against his political opponents), Trump actually said ""peace is the prize"", he was the one who got Otto released from NK and now 3 more detainees have been released, Kim is already denuclearizing and most world leaders including China, SK and Japan are crediting Trump for this (and no, its not just to inflate his ego, much as CNN would have people believe).

And this is not even half of his FIRST term. So when you say he and his supporters are oligarchs who don't care about the common American, you have to show me (and prove it to me) which one of those accomplishments were NOT in the interests of the common American. The man doesn't even take a salary (he refuses 400k per year, not a small chunk of change), his net worth has reduced by a billion dollars (not a small chunk of change either). What has he done that was solely in the interest of him or his crony oligarchs, and not in the common American's interest? What has he done that has affected the security and the economy of this nation in an adverse way? Other than emotional arguments (his tweets are mean), I have yet to hear a good argument against this president.

As far as Dr. Oz is concerned, I will definitely watch some of his videos and do my own research, but he is a small component of a fraction of what this administration is doing and I know the reason why he was (or will be) hired.

I work on the sidelines of this industry doing IT for healthcare systems, and I still don't really know what the solution is. 


I like the idea of more proactive treatments and holistic healthcare. Plans that offer premium deductions for logging physical activity, not smoking, keeping metrics in optimal ranges etc. The idea is to take the strain oof primary healthcare, which is good, but its not going to take us to the root of the problem. 


There's also a lot of work being done around genetic medicine, my organization even works with 23AndMe to incorporate that date into your healthcare plan if you are willing.  


Part of me wonders if hitting a certain technology level wont solve all of this. Right now there's so many issues that contribute to cost, think of what it takes to pay a staff of medical doctor salaries. But if you can heal the human body via nano-machines and genetic editing (CRISPR), how many surgery's can we eliminate? 


Its an uphill battle, you even find the doctors trying to impede progress under the banner of ""patient care"" because that's their hill to die on and anything they dislike or fear or just generally don't want to do, they'll insist its a patient care issue to halt the entire thing.

No it doesn't. Men are more reluctant to go to the doctor and therefore show up with more extreme symptoms and therefore get diagnosed more quickly \*at that point\*. But overall they are being more egregiously undertreated.

Example: My uncle who ""never had a day off sick in my life"" eventually ends up with severe back pain which is quickly diagnosed as inoperable prostate cancer once he finally shows up at the doctor's.

Can smoking weed damage your body/brain, yes studies have shown that smoking weed before completion of puberty has long term lasting side effects such as learning disabilities, depression, and mood instability. But that is it, every other study I have seen talks about the dangers of inhaling burning plant matter etc and say nothing about vaping and if it has any side effects. The biggest ramification of damage to life from smoking weed is the legal issues you can run into such as jail.

On the gun control side, normal people don't kill people without some serious reason like self defense. Psychopaths, depressed, manic depressives etc. shoot people and guess what, it is already illegal for someone who has been deemed mentally unstable to own a gun. The biggest problem here is in the USA most doctors will not record that a person falls into these categories and mental institutions, asylums, are basically non-existent in this day. So what we have is a bunch of people who should be restricted but due to doctors and courts not wanting to deal with it are free to purchase firearms.

There was a study where researchers provided participants with a placebo, and actually told the participants that they were being given a placebo. And it still worked, still improved their symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome!

Here is the exact phrasing the researchers used before delivering the placebo: “placebo pills made of an inert substance, like sugar pills, that have been shown in clinical studies to produce significant improvement in IBS symptoms through mind-body self-healing processes”.

So the participants were primed to expect an improvement, and consequently they did experience an improvement, even though they knew they were only getting a placebo."

Chronic sleep curtailment, even without extended (&gt;16-h) wakefulness, degrades human vigilance performance. 

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2018; 201706694 

DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1706694115

Link: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/05/15/1706694115

Significance

Millions of individuals obtain insufficient sleep on a daily basis, which leads to impaired performance. Whether these decrements are caused by short sleep duration or extended wakefulness is unknown. In this study, healthy volunteers were randomized into either a chronically sleep-restricted or control protocol while living on a 20-h “day,” thus enabling short sleep without extended wakefulness. We demonstrate that chronic insufficient sleep, even without extended wakefulness, leads to neurobehavioral performance decrements at all times of the day, even when the circadian system is promoting arousal. These findings have implications for the understanding of basic physiology, the substantial population who chronically obtains insufficient sleep, and all of us who depend on sleep-restricted individuals working in safety-sensitive occupations.

Abstract

Millions of individuals routinely remain awake for more than 18 h daily, which causes performance decrements. It is unknown if these functional impairments are the result of that extended wakefulness or from the associated shortened sleep durations. We therefore examined changes in objective reaction time performance and subjective alertness in a 32-d inpatient protocol in which participants were scheduled to wakefulness durations below 16 h while on a 20-h “day,” with randomization into standard sleep:wake ratio (1:2) or chronic sleep restriction (CSR) ratio (1:3.3) conditions. This protocol allowed determination of the contribution of sleep deficiency independent of extended wakefulness, since individual episodes of wakefulness in the CSR condition were only 15.33 h in duration (less than the usual 16 h of wakefulness in a 24-h day) and sleep episodes were 4.67 h in duration each cycle. We found that chronic short sleep duration, even without extended wakefulness, doubled neurobehavioral reaction time performance and increased lapses of attention fivefold, yet did not uniformly decrease self-reported alertness. Further, these impairments in neurobehavioral performance were worsened during the circadian night and were not recovered during the circadian day, indicating that the deleterious effect from the homeostatic buildup of CSR is expressed even during the circadian promotion of daytime arousal. These findings reveal a fundamental aspect of human biology: Chronic insufficient sleep duration equivalent to 5.6 h of sleep opportunity per 24 h impairs neurobehavioral performance and self-assessment of alertness, even without extended wakefulness.

Population attributable risk for women (PAR) 94%

Abstract
AIMS: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death among men and women globally. Women develop CHD about 10 years later than men, yet the reasons for this are unclear. The purpose of this report is to determine if differences in risk factor distributions exist between women and men across various age categories to help explain why women develop acute MI later than men.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the INTERHEART global case-control study including 27 098 participants from 52 countries, 6787 of whom were women. The median age of first acute MI was higher in women than men (65 vs. 56 years; P &lt; 0.0001). Nine modifiable risk factors were associated with MI in women and men. Hypertension [2.95(2.66 -3.28) vs. 2.32(2.16-2.48)], diabetes [4.26(3.68-4.94) vs. 2.67(2.43-2.94), physical activity [0.48(0.41-0.57) vs. 0.77(0.71-0.83)], and moderate alcohol use [0.41(0.34-0.50) vs. 0.88(0.82-0.94)] were more strongly associated with MI among women than men. The association of abnormal lipids, current smoking, abdominal obesity, high risk diet, and psychosocial stress factors with MI was similar in women and men. Risk factors associations were generally stronger among younger individuals compared to older women and men. The population attributable risk (PAR) of all nine risk factors exceeded 94%, and was similar among women and men (96 vs. 93%). Men were significantly more likely to suffer a MI prior to 60 years of age than were women, however, after adjusting for levels of risk factors, the sex difference in the probability of MI cases occurring before the age of 60 years was reduced by more than 80%.

CONCLUSION: Women experience their first acute MI on average 9 years later than men. Nine modifiable risk factors are significantly associated with acute MI in both men and women and explain greater than 90% of the PAR. The difference in age of first MI is largely explained by the higher risk factor levels at younger ages in men compared to women.


This means that over 90% of the risk for the disease are modifiable risk factors ie diet and lifestyle."
Health,"In my experience, based only on estimate because I don't carve notches in my prescription pad:

Number of people who died as a direct result of medicines I have prescribed ... a single digit number.

Number of people who died despite giving them the best and most appropriate medicines ... a three digit number.

Number of people who have had potentially fatal infections averted by vaccines or resolved on antibiotics, plus the number of people still functioning in spite of morbid endocrine, rheumatological, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular illness, plus lives saved from early detection of cancer ... easily a large four-digit number.

Non-invasive, transdermal, path-selective and specific glucose monitoring via a graphene-based platform.

Abstract

&gt; Currently, there is no available needle-free approach for diabetics to monitor glucose levels in the interstitial fluid. Here, we report a path-selective, non-invasive, transdermal glucose monitoring system based on a miniaturized pixel array platform (realized either by graphene-based thin-film technology, or screen-printing). The system samples glucose from the interstitial fluid via electroosmotic extraction through individual, privileged, follicular pathways in the skin, accessible via the pixels of the array. A proof of principle using mammalian skin ex vivo is demonstrated for specific and ‘quantized’ glucose extraction/detection via follicular pathways, and across the hypo- to hyper-glycaemic range in humans. Furthermore, the quantification of follicular and non-follicular glucose extraction fluxes is clearly shown. In vivo continuous monitoring of interstitial fluid-borne glucose with the pixel array was able to track blood sugar in healthy human subjects. This approach paves the way to clinically relevant glucose detection in diabetics without the need for invasive, finger-stick blood sampling.

Furthermore, the small mom and pop shops that have paved the way for the current cultural reversal with their valiant fight against the State should be lauded *and* left alone to continue to operate as they should, if they haven't been raided.

I live in Toronto. In the last year many of these shops have been raided even with the promise of decriminalization. It's partly due to the fact, if not all, that the government is going to start selling it soon. Interesting. The smaller vendors risk their lives and freedom for a plant they rightly deem as beneficial and then, just as their fight seems to be coming to an end, they're raided.

Half of Canada’s “first couple of cannabis,” she is in Toronto on bail for trafficking and other charges, and out of the B.C.-based Cannabis Culture chain she was trying to build with Marc, her husband who spent five years in a U.S. jail for selling marijuana seeds.

&gt;“This is clearly a corporate government takeover by people who have profited from prohibition and want to continue profiting by maintaining the status quo — banning pioneers and literally sweeping away the people who set up this industry and struggled for it,” she said. She noted that Trudeau’s pot point man is ex-“narc” and Toronto police chief Bill Blair, and those involved with government-approved licensed producers include one of Blair’s former deputies, former politicians and Bay St. investors.

&gt;“The dispensaries might continue if they stay low-key, but if you’re willing to take a stand, you will be attacked by the oppressor,” Jodie Emery said.

&gt;“These raids aren’t necessarily meant to convict someone. They’re meant to scare them, intimidate them, bully them out of business . . . criminalize the competition and clear the way for the profiteers,” of a nondeadly drug widely agreed to be beneficial to many.

&gt; First-in-human clinical trial of new targeted therapy drug reports promising responses for multiple cancers


&gt; The oral drug, BLU-667, is being investigated in a multi-center, open label trial. 


&gt; “Tumor reductions and durable responses were observed in most patients, especially those patients whose cancer progressed with chemotherapy and multi-kinase inhibitors,” said Subbiah. “Our study reported an overall response rate of 37 percent for RET-driven cancers, with responses of 45 percent for non-small cell lung cancer and 32 percent for medullary thyroid.”

Abstract

&gt; The receptor tyrosine kinase, rearranged during transfection (RET), is an oncogenic driver activated in multiple cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). No approved therapies have been designed to target RET; treatment has been limited to multi-kinase inhibitors (MKIs) which can have significant off-target toxicities and limited efficacy. BLU-667 is a highly potent and selective RET inhibitor designed to overcome these limitations. In vitro, BLU-667 demonstrated ≥10-fold increased potency over approved MKIs against oncogenic RET variants and resistance mutants. In vivo, BLU-667 potently inhibited growth of NSCLC and thyroid cancer xenografts driven by various RET mutations and fusions without inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). In first-in-human testing, BLU-667 significantly inhibited RET signaling and induced durable clinical responses in patients with RET-altered NSCLC and MTC without notable off target toxicity, providing clinical validation for selective RET targeting.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24558199/?i=2&amp;from=rhonda%20patrick

She mentions it on one of her podcasts with Joe Rogan.

The basic jist is below:

https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/health-conditions/autism/

A recent paper by a scientist who is a member of the National Academy of Science answered the “serotonin paradox,” (why do children with autism have high levels of serotonin in their blood but low levels in their brain. Professor Bruce Ames and his colleague Rhonda Patrick made a convincing case that vitamin D during pregnancy and early childhood reduces the risk of ASD by directly regulating serotonin production during human brain development. [15] Serotonin is produced by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH). In the brain, TPH activity is genetically upregulated by vitamin D but in the periphery, TPH is down regulated by vitamin D, thus explaining the “serotonin paradox.” "

The chicken's ovaduct becomes infected with the salmonella (no disease symptoms as hens are just carriers) and when the egg forms it gets inside prior to shell formation. The salmonella remains dormant due to refrigeration until it is either consumed raw or undercooked then begins to divide and cause disease. 

The washing process has absolutely nothing to do with it. In fact, the washing facilitates refrigeration which lowers total salmonella cell count, reducing the likelihood of infection. Amazing what a little bit of applied science can disprove."

Question:  How does the total burden of cardiovascular diseases vary across US states?

Findings:  In this study using the Global Burden of Disease methodology, large disparities in total burden of CVD were found between US states despite marked improvements in CVD burden.

Meaning:  These estimates can provide a benchmark for states working to focus on key risk factors, improve health care quality, and lower health care 

---
**Results:**  Between 1990 and 2016, age-standardized CVD DALYs^1 for all states decreased. Several states had large rises in their relative rank ordering for total CVD DALYs among states, including Arkansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kentucky, Missouri, Indiana, Kansas, Alaska, and Iowa. The rate of decline varied widely across states, and CVD burden increased for a small number of states in the most recent years. Cardiovascular disease DALYs remained twice as large among men compared with women. Ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of CVD DALYs in all states, but the second most common varied by state. Trends were driven by 12 groups of risk factors, with the largest attributable CVD burden due to dietary risk exposures followed by high systolic blood pressure, high body mass index, high total cholesterol level, high fasting plasma glucose level, tobacco smoking, and low levels of physical activity. Increases in risk-deleted CVD DALY rates between 2006 and 2016 in 16 states suggest additional unmeasured risks beyond these traditional factors.

**Conclusions and Relevance:**  Large disparities in total burden of CVD persist between US states despite marked improvements in CVD burden. Differences in CVD burden are largely attributable to modifiable risk exposures.  

---  
(1) The **disability-adjusted life year (DALY)** is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death. It was developed in the 1990s as a way of comparing the overall health and life expectancy of different countries."

Role of obesity in smoking behaviour: Mendelian randomisation study in UK Biobank.

DOI: 10.1136/bmj.k1767

Link: https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k1767

Abstract

Objective To determine whether body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference influence smoking status and intensity.

Design Mendelian randomisation study.

Setting UK Biobank, with replication of results from the Tobacco and Genetics (TAG) consortium.

Participants European descent participants from the UK Biobank cohort (n=372 791) and the TAG consortium (n=74 035).

Main outcome measures Risk of current and past smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, age of smoking initiation.

Results The Mendelian randomisation analysis indicated that each standard deviation increment in body mass index (4.6) increased the risk of being a smoker (odds ratio 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.23), P&lt;0.001). This association was replicated in the TAG consortium data (1.19 (1.06 to 1.33), P=0.003). Furthermore, each standard deviation increment in body mass index was estimated to increase smoking intensity by 0.88 cigarettes per day (95% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.26, P&lt;0.001) in UK Biobank and 1.27 cigarettes per day in the TAG consortium (0.46 to 2.07, P=0.002). Similar results were also seen for body fat percentage and waist circumference in both UK Biobank and the TAG consortium data.

Conclusions These results strongly suggest that higher adiposity influences smoking behaviour and could have implications for the implementation of public health interventions aiming to reduce the prevalence of these important risk factors.

Humans are meant to eat real food that grows out of the ground like Beans, lentils , vegetables, fruits.

Abstract

Corneal transplantation constitutes one of the leading treatments for severe cases of loss of corneal function. Due to its limitations, a concerted effort has been made by tissue engineers to produce functional, synthetic corneal prostheses as an alternative recourse. However, successful translation of these therapies into the clinic has not yet been accomplished. 3D bioprinting is an emerging technology that can be harnessed for the fabrication of biological tissue for clinical applications. We applied this to the area of corneal tissue engineering in order to fabricate corneal structures that resembled the structure of the native human corneal stroma using an existing 3D digital human corneal model and a suitable support structure. These were 3D bioprinted from an in-house collagen-based bio-ink containing encapsulated corneal keratocytes. Keratocytes exhibited high cell viability both at day 1 post-printing (&gt;90%) and at day 7 (83%). We established 3D bio-printing to be a feasible method by which artificial corneal structures can be engineered.

“We find little evidence to support sugar addiction in humans, and findings from the animal literature suggest that addiction-like behaviours, such as bingeing, occur only in the context of intermittent access to sugar. These behaviours likely arise from intermittent access to sweet tasting or highly palatable foods, not the neurochemical effects of sugar.”

Results revealed that from the total sample, 95% experienced at least one symptom of food dependence and 12.6% met the YFAS classification for 'food addiction' as related to DSM-IV criteria. The majority of respondents experienced these problems for combined high-fat savoury (30%) and high-fat sweet (25%) foods, whereas only a minority experienced such problems for low-fat/savoury (2%) and mainly sugar-containing foods (5%). Overweight correlated only with addictive-like problems for high-fat savoury and high-fat sweet foods (P &lt; 0.0001), while this was not found for foods mainly containing sugar.

Health,"As someone who spent the first 30 or so years of my life in poverty, I'll chime in here:

&gt; We often attribute financial problems to bad life decisions: Why didn’t that person stay in college? Why didn’t they pick a more lucrative career? Why did they have so many kids?

This is ultimately what it comes down to. Regardless of who you want to blame it on (or if you're like me and don't believe in free will at all, so don't blame anyone), a person's decisions, at least in the US, will ultimately determine their socio-economic status the VAST majority of the time.

When you grow up in poverty, it's often times the case that you're taught nothing that other kids might learn, such as delayed gratification and impulse control, because your parent (notice I didn't say parents) doesn't know about this stuff either. So you spend your entire childhood doing nothing but assimilating bad habits and destructive thought patterns. 

So is it really any wonder why their brains are fucked up as an adult? It's called dysfunction. The Left and Right both have their own ideas about how to deal with this issue, none of which will actually fix the problem, IMO. The Left are probably closer to the ideal, but it's going to take a lot more than even what they want to do, and it's going to cost a metric fuckton, both in money and man hours. And still you're not going to be able to 'fix' some people, so will have to figure out what to do with them."

Health,"**Key Points**

**Question** Why is health care spending in the United States so much greater than in other high-income countries?

**Findings**  In 2016, the United States spent nearly twice as much as 10 high-income countries on medical care and performed less well on many population health outcomes. Contrary to some explanations for high spending, social spending and health care utilization in the United States did not differ substantially from other high-income nations. Prices of labor and goods, including pharmaceuticals and devices, and administrative costs appeared to be the main drivers of the differences in spending.

**Meaning**  Efforts targeting utilization alone are unlikely to reduce the growth in health care spending in the United States; a more concerted effort to reduce prices and administrative costs is likely needed."

Health,"[Roundup is not only glyphosate, it is a mix,](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/weed-whacking-herbicide-p/) and chemical mixes can get *explosive*. 

&gt;One specific inert ingredient, polyethoxylated tallowamine, or POEA, was more deadly to human embryonic, placental and umbilical cord cells than the herbicide itself 

&gt;POEA was recognized as a common inert ingredient in herbicides in the 1980s, when researchers linked it to a group of poisonings in Japan. Doctors there examined patients who drank Roundup, either intentionally or accidentally, and determined that their sicknesses and deaths were due to POEA, not glyphosate.

&gt;POEA is a surfactant, or detergent, derived from animal fat. It is added to Roundup and other herbicides to help them penetrate plants' surfaces, making the weed killer more effective.

&gt;""POEA helps glyphosate interact with the surfaces of plant cells,"" explained Negin Martin, a scientist at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina, who was not involved in the study. POEA lowers water's surface tension--the property that makes water form droplets on most surfaces--which helps glyphosate disperse and penetrate the waxy surface of a plant.

&gt;In the French study, researchers tested four different Roundup formulations, all containing POEA and glyphosate at concentrations below the recommended lawn and agricultural dose. They also tested POEA and glyphosate separately to determine which caused more damage to embryonic, placental and umbilical cord cells.

&gt;Glyphosate, POEA and all four Roundup formulations damaged all three cell types. Umbilical cord cells were especially sensitive to POEA. Glyphosate became more harmful when combined with POEA, and POEA alone was more deadly to cells than glyphosate. "

Unravelling the effect of cell phone reliance on adolescent self-control,

Children and Youth Services Review, Volume 87, 2018, Pages 78-85, ISSN 0190-7409,

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.02.022.

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740917308381

Abstract

&gt; This study examines whether cell phones are a plausible source of adolescent behavioral problems by testing whether cell phone reliance is associated with adolescent self-control. We estimate two-level random effects regression models using three waves of the Korean Children Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS) data. The results revealed that cell phone reliance might have a contemporaneous negative effect on the level of adolescent self-control, but it has no long-term association with self-control. Concerns about the long-term effects of excessive cell phone use on adolescent self-control may be overstated, and any effect of cell phone reliance may be transient."

Coffee beans contain antioxidants BEFORE roast.  These antioxidants are lost during roast.

There is a lot of noise in coffee research, it’s a big business.

The fact is that caffeine is very addictive. Try quitting. First few days are the toughest. Totally worth it though. 

Also most coffee beans contain cadmium, this you can check lab tests on Natural News website. Heavy metals seem to give temporary energy boost (as body’s self-defence mechanisms get triggered), but in long term they accumulate in your body.

Green tea has more antioxidants than coffee, but less caffeine. It’s probably the best step towards quitting caffeine altogether. It is also much easier to drink without milk and sugar than coffee. Totally recommend it if you struggle with dairy and sugar intakes as well.

But after those first four nights of not sleeping, I finally got some Percocet and some relief. I stopped taking the fentanyl after surgery fixed the problem. It was unpleasant, to say the least, but not impossible. I fractured my leg a few years later and took Aleve and that was fine. I never liked opiates. But I would’ve killed myself without them because the pain and the limits it put on my life made it not worth living without pain relief. Making it too easy to get them is bad.

There have been reports of adverse effects, such as stomach upset, infections and allergic reactions in kombucha tea drinkers.

When improperly manufactured ceramic pots have been used for brewing, lead poisoning has occurred — the acids in the tea can leach lead from the ceramic glaze.

In short, there isn't enough evidence that kombucha tea delivers on its health claims. At the same time, several cases of harm have been reported. Therefore, the prudent approach is to avoid kombucha tea until more definitive information is available."

Health,"&gt;So is the status quo that you want changed is that I should have to contribute to other people's hospital bills via higher taxes? 

Where did I say that? And I hate to break it to you genius, but if you are on literally any form of health insurance you are absolutely paying for other people's medical expenses. Is that different because its technically not labeled as a tax even though its taken out of the check with literally all the other taxes?

&gt;If you call it a tax I won't pay it, that's paying someone else's bills mehhh
&gt;&gt;Ok we wont call it a tax anymore, we'll call it *insurance*, all better?
&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess so, sniff* *wipes away tears, sucks on thumb*.

Grow up.

Do you really not understand this? Where do you think those massive insurance premiums go when all you did that year was get a flu shot and routine physical? 


Insurance IS a form of distributed or *socialized* cost mitigation, sorry to break the news. We all pay into the pool and some benefit a LOT more than others. The only difference between the way insurance works and the way traditional social programs function is that insurance is usually privatized and we normally associate social programs with government. 


&gt;That's entitlement at it's finest.

How is it entitlement if I am paying for it? Modern healthcare insurance is pretty cut throat, if I get high blood pressure or start smoking guess what happens? My premium goes up, shocking I know. Why? Because I am a riskier insure. 


So if you were in my pool and got cancer, you would rather fit the bill for thousands of dollars worth of monthly medical bills out of pocket over letting an insurance plan mitigate the expense like they are trained to do? They know the statistical likelihood for disease per population size, you are not going to shock your insurance. 


&gt;unless you are disabled


Why is that the exception? So you don't make concession for someone struggling to feed their family and pay medical bills accrued from say an accidental injury etc. because they aren't officially ""disabled""? Fuck those people, they knew better, that's entitlement?


I can't even give you credit for having a convicted, coherent position on the topic because it makes no sense even using your own logic. 



The fact is that we all *need* healthcare but we do not all have the same level of access to healthcare due to a variety of factors. From that it becomes a moral imperative to try to establish a system that allows a degree of acceptable access across socio-economic statuses. 


In your system where everyone just fits their own bill there's going to be a trend where poor people die when they can't afford their care. In a sense you are committer wealth differentiated genocide with an asterisk next to the disabled, which I am not saying reality is not harsh, I just think its odd you would care for disabled demographics while essentially letting anyone that cannot afford their care, die. 

I guess I could be fine saying that healthcare should not be an entitlement, but that also has to work both ways, having more wealth should not *entitle* you to care over someone that cannot afford it, that seems fundamentally immoral.

- Feedlot production produces lower emissions than adaptive multi-paddock grazing.
- Adaptive multi-paddock grazing can sequester large amounts of soil C.
- Emissions from the grazing system were offset completely by soil C sequestration.
- Soil C sequestration from well-managed grazing may help to mitigate climate change.

Built environment associates of active school travel in New Zealand children and youth: A systematic meta-analysis using individual participant data. 

Journal of Transport &amp; Health, 2018; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.jth.2018.04.007

Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140518300240?via%3Dihub

Highlights

• Distance to school was the strongest predictor of active travel to school.

• Increased street connectivity around schools was related to active travel to school.

• Dwelling density was negatively associated with active travel to school.

• School socioeconomic status was negatively associated with school travel mode.

• Distance to school is a key consideration for school zoning and catchment policies.

Abstract

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the associations between active travel to school and the neighbourhood built environment in children and youth by systematically identifying and collating data from New Zealand studies. Data from five studies involving 2844 children and youth aged 6–19 years were included in the meta-analysis. Data on participant demographics and school characteristics were obtained from each study, and built environment features within 400 m and 1 km buffers around home were calculated in a consistent manner using geographic information systems. A one-step individual participant data meta-analysis was performed in SAS. Using stepwise logistic regression, age, school socioeconomic status, distance to school, dwelling density and intersection density (400 m and 1 km buffers) were taken forward from bivariate analyses into a multiple variable model. Active travel to school was positively associated with intersection density (p &lt; 0.001) (1 km buffer) and negatively associated with school socioeconomic status (p = 0.001), dwelling density (p = 0.004) (1 km buffer), and distance to school (p &lt; 0.001), including age, sex, ethnicity and number of siblings as fixed effects in the final model. The findings of this meta-analysis can be used to guide and support the development of policies on school location and catchment, and pedestrian and cycling infrastructure for children and youth to actively and safely travel to school.

Health,"“Moderation Kills”

-Dr Caldwell Essylsten MD


Take a look at what [Americans eat.](https://imgur.com/a/Zf1pv2M)

39% of calories come from added fats, sugars and oils. 

30% animal products

22% grains (90% of which are highly processed)

9% vegetables fruit and legumes (most of which are French fries, ketchup, apple and orange juice).

So if people just ate their normal diet, but in moderation, maybe it would go from 30% animal products to 15% animal products, you’re still going to get chronic disease. 39% calories from refined sugar, fat and oil. What would be a moderate amount? How can we get people who consume this much processed food to all the sudden eat a moderate amount?

If we put these labels on foods, it’s not going to make them suddenly stop eating it all together.

And things like soda and sweet beverages are completely unnecessary and contain absolutely zero nutrients. 

If people had a moderate amount of soda they would immediately supersede the recommended grams of added sugar in their diet with a few sips.

Health,"Indifferent, they're both effective at delivering safe eggs to the general public. But you are looking at the situation wrong, or at least not seeing all of the determining factors. Even if vaccines were 100% effective against all subspecies of salmonella (which they objectively aren't), the USDA would still require the washing step prior to sale. The USDA is in a spot where now that the washing has been the status quo for decades, the American public is used to seeing spotless, shiny eggs. As soon as Ashley Housewife in Suburbia, USA opens a carton of eggs and sees a chicken turd the size of a dime on top of the egg, you know darn well she's gonna get her panties ALL UP IN A WAD and complain incessantly about it. The USDA made its bed and were all sleeping in it, for better or worse. "

Health,"Doctors are always prescribing pharmaceuticals instead of turning to natural remedies first. It boggles my mind. Natural remedies aren't like homeopathy or something quacky. They're legit, evidence-based medicines that come from normal foods we eat or activities we do.

For example, every time I used to go to the dermatologist as a kid for acne, my dr would always say that food isn't linked with acne or that diet doesn't cause acne... then proceeds to prescribe pharmacetuicals. And THEN you have the National Institutes of Health publishing study after study that says that diet can cause acne. [source] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836431). Like, what gives, you know?

And you also have researchers finding that manuka honey, spices (like garlic and oil of oregano), and others have been proven to help treat acne. [source] (http://www.wellnessnova.com/2016/11/10-alternative-methods-treat-acne/). But doctors won't prescribe them despite the obvious evidence backing their efficacy. I just don't understand.

Health,"Whatever you get from this... 

The cost of health care in the USA is insane. I mean... we use words like 'gouge' to describe double or triple costs for things we need, but the health care industry is charging 5-10 times what 'things', should cost.

When you go to the Doctor, or the ER, the bill that's sent is expected to be negotiated by the insurance company. That's how it works. The ins' co. gets the bill, and they say, 'no, that's too much, but we'll pay this instead', and it goes back and forth until they reach an agreement.

But no one ever takes the actual patient into consideration in this negotiation. The patient gets left with the inflated cost that no one should ever have to pay.

When you get your next bill... call and ask for the bill to be itemized. Then when you get it, go to healthcarebluebook.com, type in the codes for your items and compare them nationally.

Then... go back to your doctor or hospital armed with the national averages for the same procedures and treatments that you received.... and negotiate a better deal.

I've been doing this for years now, and it's worked at least 'some' every time.

I have no affiliation of any kind with healthcarebluebook. I just use the service when I have a bill to pay. There are other services similar. YMMV."

 1. Replacement of SFA with n\-6 FA  associated with lower CVD risk, while replacement of SFA with refined CHOs \(starches and sugars\) is associated with a neutral/adverse effect

2. Consumption of fructose\-sweetened, HFCS\-sweetened or sucrose\-sweetened beverages = increases in risk factors for cardiometabolic disease \&gt; than isocaloric amounts of starch. Risk factors associated with metabolic dysregulation increase even when fructose\-containing sugars are consumed with diets that do not result in \+ energy intake/weight gain

3. At comparable levels of energy restriction, high\-CHO/low\-fat weight loss diets do not impede fat loss compared with low\-CHO/high\-fat diets.

Health,"title is not vague -- it's very clear -- you are over thinking it:

the fact is, demand for transplants has remained the same -- massively under-serviced.

there are two simple problems:

1.  not enough healthy people are dying;

2.  when a healthy person dies, their organs stay fresh for less than an hour.

fortunately, opiates solve two problems:


1.  opiate overdoses have skyrocketed the number of health people dying.

2.  opiates in the system act as an ""organ preservative"" -- allowing organs to stay fresh for up to 5 hours.

more overdoses = more available product (heart, liver, lungs etc)

hence... 24x increase in transplants.  (demand is constant --- never fully satisfied.  the only thing changing: a LOT more product is getting to market, with a longer shelf-life.)

[The journal article in question](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422%2813%2970278-3/fulltext#article_upsell) is a review from 2014, which discusses other articles and reviews on developmental neurotoxins. It hasn't ""officially classified"" anything, nor does it have the authority to do so. And just to re-iterate, this happened in 2014, so this isn't exactly breaking news.

Anyway, let me clarify the facts.

Based on their literature review, the authors of the Lancet's review have identified and discussed several substances for which there is evidence that they may hinder development in children, and pointed out that ""Untested chemicals should not be presumed to be safe to brain development, and chemicals in existing use and all new chemicals must therefore be tested for developmental neurotoxicity."" I personally find it disturbing that this needs to be pointed out in the first place, but I digress.

On the topic of flouride in particular they basically refer the reader on to [a singular, separate meta-analysis of 27 studies on developmental flouride neurotoxicity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22820538?dopt=Abstract) from 2012 which had already done the work for them. I haven't got the full article here, but the conclusion was that ""children in high-fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-fluoride areas"". The only conclusions the authors draw from this is that there is a ""possibility of an adverse effect of high fluoride exposure on children's neurodevelopment"".

I think this certainly does give a valid reason to be concerned about flouride in drinking water, but it's hardly a shocking reveal of new smoking gun evidence that proves flouride is a neurotoxin to everybody and ""officially"" classifies it as such. So far there's only actual evidence that children may be affected."

Health,Sure concerns me about the conflicting interests regarding curing cancer.... A powerful industry would sure lose a lot of money.
Health,"We do and I should say we are still very lucky in that regard and we don’t actually ‘have’ to have insurance. We are charged higher taxes if we earn over a certain amount (which I don’t totally disagree with) as it is $90,000. That’s a fairly high wage so. If you have insurance our government also helps you pay for the high premiums by offering a rebate. Once you turn 31 if you don’t take up the hospital cover then you start losing your rebate reduces so it becomes more expensive.

So I would say we are still a very lucky country and we do still have a somewhat free health care system but like everything it’s getting harder and every year the government allows insurance companies to put up their premiums by massive amounts. I herd (don’t quote me on this) our rates have gone up 20% in the last four years. Then less and less things are covered each year to.

Tell that to the thousands if not millions of kids who have been diagnosed with a nonexistent food allergy by a naturopath, because naturopaths use a “food allergy test” (IGG response) which does not actually indicate food allergies, according to science, but rather indicates that the body has been exposed to the food and has learned to tolerate it. 

This is not benign, nor is it uncommon. Many children and their families are forced to go through significant hardship to adapt their diets to these nonexistent allergies. Without proper nutrition counselling (which naturopaths are generally not equipped to provide) it puts the kids at risk of malnutrition. And in the most extreme cases, people have died. "

False. 

Bill Gates has stated great progress has been made with vaccines, in terms of developing and distributing them. He has also described vaccines as one of the tools for reducing infant mortality and reducing overall population growth. Those two points are linked, but not in the negative way you are portraying it. 

Reducing overall population growth is a publicly stated goal of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that's not a secret and it's widely agreed that it is a necessary goal as we are overburdening natural resources and the environment.

It's also widely agreed that reducing child mortality rates is critical to this; simply put, parents don't have as many kids if the kids they already have are less likely to die.

Vaccines stop children dying. That is the primary point."

&gt; Education, not income, the best predictor of a long life


&gt; The researchers point out that better education leads to improved cognition and in turn to better choices for health-related behaviours. Recent decades have seen a shift in the disease burden from infectious to chronic diseases, the latter of which are largely lifestyle-related. As time goes on, the link between education and better health choices, and therefore life expectancy, will become even more apparent.

Education and Health: Redrawing the Preston Curve. 

Population and Development Review, 2018; 

DOI: 10.1111/padr.12141

Summary and conclusions

We revisited the influential 1975 paper by Preston on the relationship between income and life expectancy across most countries of the world for the 1930s and 1960s and extended the analysis to the period 1970–2015. We demonstrated that the distinct pattern identified by Preston, showing a strongly concave relationship and an upward shift of the curves, continued over the subsequent half century as assessed at the global level.

We then plotted the same kind of relationship replacing GDP per person with the mean years of schooling of the adult population to see whether educational attainment could be a better predictor of life expectancy than income. The associations turn out to be very different, with the curves becoming largely linear and overlapping. This suggests that educational attainment is a better predictor in the sense that its effect on life expectancy does not diminish at higher levels and, in particular, it does not leave an unexplained shift over time that has to be explained by other factors.

To validate this visual analysis, we conducted multivariate analyses on a balanced panel of 174 countries for 1970–2015, which in addition to GDP per person and mean years of schooling of the adult population included country and period fixed‐effects, and we performed sensitivity runs with alternative income indicators and weighting schemes. In all of the models the effect of educational attainment on life expectancy is highly significant in the expected direction, and the standardized coefficients are clearly larger than those of income.

To consider the possibility of a different pattern for the determinants of child mortality, we carried out the analysis separately for under‐5 mortality. Again, for the association with GDP per person there was strong non‐linearity and a shift of the curve over time that was particularly pronounced between 1970 and 1990. Viewed in relation to mean years of schooling of women aged 20–39, the relationship again was much more linear with virtually no shift between 1970 and 1990. Between 1990 and 2010 child mortality in the highest‐mortality countries declined more rapidly than suggested by the gains in mothers’ education. This is an indication that massive efforts by the international community and private donors in recent years to lower child mortality in some of the least developed countries were successful in doing so to a greater extent than would be expected from improving educational attainment alone. This was not equally the case with respect to adult mortality.

Where does this empirical evidence leave us with respect to testing the hypothesis that the empirical association between GDP and life expectancy depicted by the Preston curve and widely assumed in the literature is a spurious one, with education in fact driving both changes? The macro‐level evidence presented here strongly supports the view that this is a plausible hypothesis that deserves further elaboration. In our section on causality, we also assessed the different specified criteria for functional causality, including a strong empirical association, a valid narrative of the causal mechanism, and ruling out alternative explanations such as selectivity and reverse causality. This strong aggregate‐level finding should be further explored at the individual and community level under different cultural, social, and economic conditions.

Studies at the micro level are more easily conducted for child mortality than for adult mortality since the information can be provided in surveys by mothers. Multi‐level analyses of the determinants of child mortality across a large number of developing countries have shown that mothers’ education at every level of attainment was more important than wealth/income, was the dominating factor at the household and community level, and played a key role at the national level (Pamuk, Fuchs, and Lutz 2011). A comparable individual‐level study for adult mortality is much more difficult because there are no consistent data on adult deaths by education, income, and other relevant characteristics. Even in most industrialized countries with efficient vital registration systems, such micro‐level analysis will be difficult unless a comprehensive population register exists. With some extra effort, census data that have information on these characteristics can be linked with information about subsequent deaths. Where such matching studies have been conducted, they all show significant mortality differentials by level of education (Caselli et al. 2014). But such studies often lack the income information for comparative analysis. For developing countries, the data challenges are much greater and—possibly except for the cases of demographic surveillance systems—probably insurmountable at present.

The global time series analysis of national data strongly suggests that the apparent positive association between health and income can largely be attributed to increasing educational attainment, which at the same time leads to rising incomes (Lutz, Crespo Cuaresma, and Sanderson 2008) and better health outcomes. While additional individual‐level analysis of this issue is needed, the patterns presented here suggest that education should be considered a policy priority for improving global health."

Health,"I challenge anyone skeptical of homeopathy give Symphytum to someone with a broken bone or torn ligament and tell me it didn’t mend amazingly.  

I have countless stories with this remedy alone. Native Americans used it before and after a fight. They knew then what we know now: that it’s called “knitbone” for a good reason.  

Here’s one: dog gets hit-and-run by a car and left on the road with a shattered hip.  Vet says it’ll be $6000 to treat the dog for injury, and it’ll never walk right again. Owner is faced with putting the dog down; he doesn’t have the money for that.  Instead take the dog home and give it rest, and homeopathic symphytum, once per day for a few weeks, then every other day for the next few.  Two months went by while the dog steadily improved, and today you wouldn’t know it ever happened.  

I have dozens like that. 

Then after that we can talk Shingles.  In my practice, 10 years using homeopathy, I still “bat 1000” in cases of acute shingles.  In the large majority of cases, Rhus-tox is the remedy.  

If you’re skeptical of homeopathy ask yourself this: how can millions of people every day benefit from something that you believe doesn’t work.   

I interned for a while at a homeopathic clinic in Mumbai.  Indian people are especially pragmatic, and won’t part with a rupee unless they’re getting something in return.  We were open 7 days a week and saw a line out the door of about 70-90 people per day.  I saw cases of gangrene, even, cured within days.  This case, the gentleman had already been to hospital.  In fact, it was medicine they gave him that made matters worse, and he developed Henoch Schonlein Purpurea. (Autoimmune reaction).  Steroids weren’t working to stop the reaction.  The physician working the clinic was an MD with impeccable reputation and resume, including chief of cardiology at Pune hospital and years of oncology practice.  The doctor gave Aurum-mur-natronatum and the HSP began to resolve by the next day.  Within 9 days he was cured.  

I have dozens of stories like that, too.  Supposedly incurable diseases.  Supposedly needing surgery or radical intervention, or simply left for dead.   

Patients scheduled for surgery who, when they went for pre-op, were found to not need it anymore.  Go figure.   

The saddest part of these stories is the willful ignorance of their allopathic physicians.  It is so very very rare that the MD will reach out to ask and learn how they were in fact cured.  

Have a curious mind.  Challenge your beliefs. If they stand up, then keep them. But if your beliefs aren’t in line with reality, then keep your mind open to something else.  If you really believe homeopathy is bunkum, that’s okay.  Plenty of the best homeopathic physicians were initially skeptical.  But they did the right thing: they tried it.  

Think about this: Dr Samuel Hahnemman, the founder of modern homeopathy, is the only physician with a statue in his likeness in our nations capital, Washington DC.  In his time, and still today, the elite sought out homeopathy.  

To the open minded and curious, these books are must reads:

I also point people to the free ebook on homeopathy by a once-skeptical MD Dr. Dooley called Beyond Flat Earth Medicine (beyond flat earth.com)

If you want to troll for pubmed links and evidence, I will only say do your own research.  If you’re curious to learn more, I might be able to help. "
Health,I just wish alcohol wasn't exempt from adding the nutritional info like any other beverage
Health,"Here is my question, obviously cocoa contains some psychoactive chemical. It's important to think about wether this is actually benefiting the brain or just stimulating it mildly like say caffeine.  My guess is that if you ate dark chocolate every day, you would rapidly lose these benefits and the mood boost is only acute due to homeostasis. I would also wager that it has withdrawal effects to but because the effect is so mild in the first place no one anecdotally experiences cocoa withdraws."
Health,"Yeah. Funny how that info got lost somewhere along the way for 3/4 of a million people.  

Maybe from here on out it will be administered correctly."
Health,"I can't explicitly argue with that point, but you'd still expect the overall statistical trend to be that that the higher the quality/level of your education, the more likely you are to earn more.

Also, I should point out that I (probably mistakenly) interpreted/assumed 'income' to be equivalent with 'wealth' (i.e. the better of you are, the better education you'll have access to)."

Health,"Most people don't like going to the doctor. Many I've seen as being a Medic, get hypertensive around medical personnel.

Health,"Wish you guys could’ve seen my office today.  It would be very eye opening.  Full day of all kinds amazing cases.  Amazing success.  Honestly I’m more humbled by homeopathy every day.  Three Nat-mur cases in a row.  For you skeptics: Medically verifiable illnesses improving.  The best part is that the improvements are global.  "
Health,"Talk to a GOOD doctor.

I have had plenty of docs who have no idea what they're talking about. I'm not saying that because I am smarter and totally a homeopathic specialist or some BS like that. I have a specific, fairly niche chronic illness that reacts to a lot of common medications and, even though it is in my chart, I regularly get told to take those meds. And I quit those doctors.

And my specialists, over the years, who do know their shit and do know Western medicine in and out are the ones who have adviced me to try Chinese medicine and Ayuverdic medicine in conjunction with Western medicine. (It's worked nicely and all of the practitioners converse about my conditions and how to treat them.) These doctors are associated with internationally recognized research hospitals and have done a lot to change my life. I was highly sceptical of other modes of medicine until my neurologist working with my acupuncturist radically changed my health (together). "

Health,"&gt; None of what I learned is at odds with homeopathy, except some tenets of microbiology

So like germ theory......the basis of modern medicine?

I just want to point out....you either have no education in anything you've mentioned or you're flat out lying. Homeopathy is definitely at odds with every single discipline you've listed. Every single one of those disciplines relies on quantifiable and reproducible information....homeopathy cannot achieve any measurable effect (different from placebo) and none of your anecdotal miraculous cures can be reproduced in any study done so far, nor do those claims make any sense based on any field of science. 

&gt;You can get there....Follow up with the great prescribers mentioned there, you’ll find the right teacher when you’re ready. 

I'm having a really hard time believing you're not a troll..."
Health,Very true that's why I only study diploma courses that way you focus only on what you need
Health,"Very interesting! I remember though when I was pregnant I had a major love affair with Cadbury mini eggs (I went through the big bags like no tomorrow, lol) and my little guy is ahead of the curve in a lot of mental/cognitive ways. He also gets a bit of chocolate or some cookies every single day. 

I kind of take articles like this with a grain of salt because your genes and overall lifestyle as well as parenting style make a huge difference with kids. I make sure to read with my son everyday, we do puzzles, I ask him questions and we turn off the TV to do playtime so he doesn't try to play with toys and watch TV at the same time (splitting his focus). He is much calmer than most two year olds and understands a lot of things other kids his age haven't grasped yet. I think sugar (like many things) is just fine in moderation!

Health,"I guess if I have no heart rate after 10 seconds that would be a good predictor of death. But all kidding aside, they do not give any numbers as to what HRR should look like. I get my rate up to 148 on a treadmill after 1/2 hour of exercise; then what should it go down to in the first 10 seconds after cessation of exercise? I need a baseline here. "

Health,This is incredible
Health,"Yes we have. I had allergy shots in college. "
Health,"My daughter has a rash on her stomach that started appearing 2 or 3 days ago, but it has gotten really bad over the past day or so. Her doctor is on vacation and out of state until next week, so we are trying to see if we get some advice, information and/or ideas about what it might have been caused by, and what we might be able to try to do to help it go away? Or, at least, try to help in some way?

We are in central Arizona and it certainly seems like there are more pollens in the air lately, so I was thinking that it could be some sort of allergic reaction, but I don't know that for sure. Also, we have a cat, and my daughter often lays in her bed with it - sometimes, after having baby oil on her stomach (due to her having a Baby Doppler heartbeat monitor that she uses multiple times each day) - so I'm wondering if it's maybe cat dander or some sort of germs from the cat that irritatied her skin, or caused an allergic reaction, that is causing the rash?

If someone would take a look at the picture of the rash on her stomach that I have posted, and see if they might be able to offer some helpful advice, it would be very much appreciated. Thank you very much to anyone who tries to help with this situation!

By the way, if anyone has any suggestions about lotions or ointments or anything like that that might help to alleviate this rash, feel free to make a suggestion. Please just keep in mind that she is almost 8 months pregnant. And with regards to that, we spoke to a pharmacist at Walgreens, who would not actually look at her stomach, but he mentioned possibly looking for some sort of Benadryl Lotion. We also went to the local Walmart, and the woman there, who did look at her stomach, mentioned trying some sort of lotion with oatmeal in it, and she was a fan of natural remedies, and she also mentioned a lotion called Sarna Anti-Itch Lotion, which was around $11, so we didn't end up trying that yet, as I didn't want to spend almost $11 on a lotion that may not actually help with the rash."
Health,"Assuming a person is healthy otherwise, is being winded simply a sign that the person is out of shape?

I get winded going up a flight of stairs. I have sleep apnea (CPAP doesn’t really work that well), am tired all the time and hav been wondering if I am just out of shape due to not exercising. I am about 15 pounds over weight, as I am 6’ and 205 pounds "

Health,"I’ve been looking into that as well! The importance of healthy patient/individual-specific diet and lifestyle are so underrated. Most chronic diseases can be reversed by lifestyle changes, with minimal pharmaceutical use. Problem is that most people don’t have the resources to kick bad habits that they’ve been doing for 10-30+ years. Ten to fifteen minute long appointments with a doctor can’t possibly go far enough into the patient’s issues to create a basis for lasting change.

Health,"Exercise does not do much for lungs directly or pulmonary system for that matter. In fact, that system is already efficient as it can be. Without getting into all the details, exercise essentially improves how efficiently your body is able to deliver and use oxygen. So when you climb stairs, the reason someone who is unfit is breathing heavily is because their body is having a hard time providing oxygen to their leg muscles, so they breathe harder to compensate for the lack of O2. A fit person who has a very well developed system to deliver and use O2 does not need to compensate as much.

Total cost: $100 (after extended benefits reimbursement) for the initial ambulance ride. Because we were out of town and I wouldn't leave my son alone overnight, the hospital social worker provided us with free parking passes for my husband and a few meal tickets for me to use at the cafeteria, even.

You get the bill for your portion of the visits and procedures, plus all the little things the ins company has decided they won’t pay for (when it comes to treatments they know better than your doctor after all). Plus the monthly premium for the insurance itself, of course. I work at a smaller company so for my family of four we have the option to pay almost $700 a month for shitty insurance that covers almost nothing (after deductible, of course!). My uncle had insurance and yet somehow ended up destitute by the time my aunt died of cancer. Their savings, including college fund they had started for my cousin, was totally wiped out. And the hospital continued to send bills after she died so he also had to hire a lawyer. Fun stuff to deal with as you’re burying your spouse.

Here it measures the difference in risk for autism between two groups – for example those who received the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine versus those who did not. An odds ratio of 1 means no difference in risk. Numbers below 1.00 indicate decreased risk. Those above 1.00 indicate increased risk. The possibility of decreased risk was strongest for the MMR vaccine, with an odds ratio of 0.84, or a 16 percent risk reduction.

Abstract

&gt; We report injectable nanoengineered hemostats for enhanced wound healing and tissue regeneration. The nanoengineered system consists of the natural polysaccharide, κ-carrageenan (κCA), loaded with synthetic two-dimensional (2D) nanosilicates. Nanoengineered hydrogels showed shear-thinning characteristics and can be injected for minimally invasive approaches. The injectable gels can be physically crosslinked in presence of monovalent ions to form mechanically strong hydrogels. By controlling the ratio between κCA and nanosilicates, compressive stiffness of crosslinked hydrogels can be modulated between 20 and 200 kPa. Despite high mechanical stiffness, nanocomposite hydrogels are highly porous with an interconnected network. The addition of nanosilicates to κCA increases protein adsorption on nanocomposite hydrogels that results in enhance cell adhesion and spreading, increase platelets binding and reduce blood clotting time. Moreover, due to presence of nanosilicates, a range of therapeutic biomacromolecules can be deliver in a sustain manner. The addition of nanosilicates significantly suppresses the release of entrap vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and facilitate in vitro tissue regeneration and wound healing. Thus, this multifunctional nanocomposite hydrogel can be used as an injectable hemostat and an efficient vehicle for therapeutic delivery to facilitate tissue regeneration.

Statement of Significance

&gt; Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death in battlefield wounds, anastomosis hemorrhage and percutaneous intervention. Thus, there is a need for the development of novel bioactive materials to reduce the likelihood of hemorrhagic shock stemming from internal wounds. Here, we introduce an injectable hemostat from kappa-carrageenan and two-dimensional (2D) nanosilicates. Nanosilicates mechanically reinforce the hydrogels, provide enhanced physiological stability and accelerate the clotting time by two-fold. The sustained release of entrapped therapeutics due to presence of nanosilicates promotes enhanced wound healing. The multifunctional nanocomposite hydrogels could be used as an injectable hemostat for penetrating injury and percutaneous intervention during surgery."

Abstract:

&gt; Excessive, problematic smartphone use (PSU) has demonstrated relationships with depression and anxiety severity across studies. However, less is known about psychopathology-related variables that may mediate relations between depression/anxiety with PSU – especially variables involving emotional regulation processes. We recruited 261 college students for a repeated-measures web survey, administered self-report measures of depression, anxiety sensitivity, distress tolerance, mindfulness, smartphone use frequency, and PSU; one month later, participants completed these measures again. We tested a model where depression severity and anxiety sensitivity predicted distress tolerance and mindfulness, in turn predicting smartphone use frequency, and one-month PSU severity, adjusting for age and sex. Distress tolerance and mindfulness were inversely associated with levels of PSU. Distress tolerance mediated relations between anxiety sensitivity and levels of PSU. Mindfulness mediated relations between both depression and anxiety sensitivity with PSU severity. Results are discussed in the context of emotion regulation theory and compensatory internet use theory, with clinical implications for emotion regulation skills training and mindfulness in offsetting PSU."

Health,"Currently getting my Masters in Public Health. I'm currently taking epidemiology of chronic disease. I'm studying things like this on a daily basis, and to me, it's disingenuous to ignore the impact of diet and disease when talking about DALY's. 

Look at the fresh diet in hawaii vs. in Louisiana. 

In “Obesity and cardiovascular risk intervention through the ad libitum feeding of traditional Hawaiian diet,” published in the AJCN (1), twenty native Hawaiians, who were consuming the more traditional American high carb diet, were placed on what as called the ""pre-Western-contact"" Hawaiian diet for 21 d. So, they switched from the low fat, high carb American diet, to the even lower fat, higher carb Hawaiian diet.

The ""Hawaiian"" diet was low in fat (7%), high in complex carbohydrates (78%), and moderate in protein (15%). While eating ""ad libitum"" (no portion or calorie restriction) the average calorie intake decreased from 2594 to 1569 per day (around a 40% restriction, while eating to full). That's quite an impressive decrease! The average weight loss was 22 lbs. The average cholesterol decreased around 15% and BP decreased an average of 11.5 systolic and 8.9 diastolic.

In a second study published in the Hawaiian Medical Journal in 2001 (2), this same Hawaiian Diet was fed ad libitum (without calorie or portion size restriction) to adults for 21 days. The Hawaii Diet was high in complex carbohydrate (77% of calories), low in fat (12% of calories), and moderate in protein (11% of calories). The dramatic changes over the 21 days include:

- Weight loss averaged 11 lbs,
- Systolic BP decreased an average of 136.0 to 125.5
- Diastolic BP decreased an average of 82.7 to 78.9,
- Cholesterol levels fell from 205.3 to 156.9,
- LDL from 125.9 to 94.9,
- HDL from 38.3 to 31.3,
- Triglycerides from 238.7 to 152.2
- Blood sugar levels from 112.2 to 91.5

These results are not only dramatic but were achieved in just 21 days. And, contrary to the popular press and medias constant ridicule of a low fat, high carb diet, these results were achieved on a diet that was higher in carb and lower in fat than the typical American low fat, high carb diet. Clearly, not all low fat, high carb diets are the same.

The low fat, high carb diets resembling the traditional native Hawaiian diet and the Tarahumara diet give us insight on how to effectively apply a low fat high carb reduced calorie diet, while still achieving optimal nutrition. These diets are nutrient dense, highly therapeutic and, when the subjects are encouraged to eat until satisfied without calorie or portion control, they achieved a 40% reduction in calories.

So, don't be misled or be confused by simple comparisons, criticisms (or praise for) macro-nutrient ratios, without understanding the food that is contributing to those macro-nutrient ratios and its effects on health. There are many types of high fat diets, and high protein diets. There are also many types of high carb diets. And there are many types of food that can make up either of them.

&gt; A new class of antibiotics to combat drug resistance


&gt; Called odilorhabdins, or ODLs, the antibiotics are produced by symbiotic bacteria found in soil-dwelling nematode worms that colonize insects for food. The bacteria help to kill the insect and, importantly, secrete the antibiotic to keep competing bacteria away. 


&gt; “We found that the ODL compounds cured mice infected with several pathogenic bacteria and demonstrated activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, notably including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacae,” said co-corresponding author Maxime Gualtieri, co-founder and chief scientific officer of Nosopharm.

Antibacterial Agents that Cause Miscoding by Binding at a New Ribosomal Site.

Summary

&gt; Growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria and shortage of antibiotic discovery platforms challenge the use of antibiotics in the clinic. This threat calls for exploration of unconventional sources of antibiotics and identification of inhibitors able to eradicate resistant bacteria. Here we describe a different class of antibiotics, odilorhabdins (ODLs), produced by the enzymes of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster of the nematode-symbiotic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila. ODLs show activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and can eradicate infections in animal models. We demonstrate that the bactericidal ODLs interfere with protein synthesis. Genetic and structural analyses reveal that ODLs bind to the small ribosomal subunit at a site not exploited by current antibiotics. ODLs induce miscoding and promote hungry codon readthrough, amino acid misincorporation, and premature stop codon bypass. We propose that ODLs’ miscoding activity reflects their ability to increase the affinity of non-cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosome.

Chronic Supplementation With a Mitochondrial Antioxidant (MitoQ) Improves Vascular Function in Healthy Older Adults.

Abstract

&gt; Excess reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria is a key mechanism of age-related vascular dysfunction. Our laboratory has shown that supplementation with the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant MitoQ improves vascular endothelial function by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and ameliorates arterial stiffening in old mice, but the effects in humans are unknown. Here, we sought to translate our preclinical findings to humans and determine the safety and efficacy of MitoQ. Twenty healthy older adults (60–79 years) with impaired endothelial function (brachial artery flow–mediated dilation &lt;6%) underwent 6 weeks of oral supplementation with MitoQ (20 mg/d) or placebo in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design study. MitoQ was well tolerated, and plasma MitoQ was higher after the treatment versus placebo period (P&lt;0.05). Brachial artery flow–mediated dilation was 42% higher after MitoQ versus placebo (P&lt;0.05); the improvement was associated with amelioration of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species–related suppression of endothelial function (assessed as the increase in flow-mediated dilation with acute, supratherapeutic MitoQ [160 mg] administration; n=9; P&lt;0.05). Aortic stiffness (carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity) was lower after MitoQ versus placebo (P&lt;0.05) in participants with elevated baseline levels (carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity &gt;7.60 m/s; n=11). Plasma oxidized LDL (low-density lipoprotein), a marker of oxidative stress, also was lower after MitoQ versus placebo (P&lt;0.05). Participant characteristics, endothelium-independent dilation (sublingual nitroglycerin), and circulating markers of inflammation were not different (all P&gt;0.1). These findings in humans extend earlier preclinical observations and suggest that MitoQ and other therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species may hold promise for treating age-related vascular dysfunction.

&gt; Prescription drug overpayments (also known as “clawbacks”) occur when commercially
insured patients’ copayments exceed the total cost of the drug to their insurer or pharmacy
benefit manager. While the practice has been acknowledged and discussed in the media,
it has never been quantified in large samples. We use pharmacy claims data from a large
commercial insurer, combined with data on national average drug reimbursements, to
identify claims that likely involved overpayments. In 2013, almost one quarter of filled
pharmacy prescriptions (23%) involved a patient copayment that exceeded the average
reimbursement paid by the insurer by more than $2.00. Among these overpayment claims,
the average overpayment is $7.69. Overpayments are more likely on claims for generic
versus brand drugs (28% vs. 6%), but the average size of the overpayment on generic
claims is smaller ($7.32 vs. $13.46). In 2013, total overpayments amounted to $135 million
in our sample, or $10.51 per covered life. With over 200 million Americans commercially
insured in 2013, these findings suggest the practice of overpayments may account for a nonnegligible
share of overall drug spending and patient out-of-pocket costs. 

To me the biggest surprise in the news article ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/20180425042246/https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/Why-do-the-insured-pay-more-for-prescriptions-12845913.php)) was:

&gt; Hearing loss affects more than two-thirds of the elderly population, and more than 17% of all adults in the U.S. Sensorineural hearing loss related to noise exposure or aging is associated with loss of inner ear sensory hair cells (HCs), cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), and ribbon synapses between HCs and SGNs, stimulating intense interest in therapies to regenerate synaptic function. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (DHF) is a selective and potent agonist of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and protects the neuron from apoptosis. Despite evidence that TrkB agonists can promote survival of SGNs, local delivery of drugs such as DHF to the inner ear remains a challenge. We previously demonstrated in an animal model that a fluorescently labeled bisphosphonate, 6-FAM-Zol, administered to the round window membrane penetrated the membrane and diffused throughout the cochlea. Given their affinity for bone mineral, including cochlear bone, bisphosphonates offer an intriguing modality for targeted delivery of neurotrophic agents to the SGNs to promote survival, neurite outgrowth, and, potentially, regeneration of synapses between HCs and SGNs. The design and synthesis of a bisphosphonate conjugate of DHF (Ris-DHF) is presented, with a preliminary evaluation of its neurotrophic activity. Ris-DHF increases neurite outgrowth in vitro, maintains this ability after binding to hydroxyapatite, and regenerates synapses in kainic acid-damaged cochlear organ of Corti explants dissected in vitro with attached SGNs. The results suggest that bisphosphonate–TrkB agonist conjugates have promise as a novel approach to targeted delivery of drugs to treat sensorineural hearing loss.

The big unknown is cardiovascular risk. I get your point that studies haven’t adequately accounted for heavy cannabis smoking, but the current evidence suggests that tobacco and lung cancer is clearly linked while no such link has been found between cannabis smoking and lung cancer. Please see the National Academy of Sciences’ report on cannabis from 2017 where they indicate a moderate amount of evidence exists that there is no statistical correlation between cannabis smoking and lung cancer. Heavy use isn’t as accounted for, but I’m pretty sure tobacco showed increased risk in a linear relationship in similar case control studies. 

Also it should be clearly stated that someone that smokes 1-3 joints a day is a heavy cannabis smoker, so your comparison is inaccurate. That is not a moderate user and only a small fraction of cannabis consumers smoke that much. In fact many don’t smoke at all. They eat or vape. 

One other note of agreement is that people that are thinking cannabis smoking is harmless are wrong. We have basically gone from thinking cannabis is no different from
meth to thinking it is harmless. It is harmful, it’s just less so than alcohol or tobacco. "

You first have to realize their you have useless parents who dont know shit. Thats quite an existencial realization that can really suck, and may not be knowable by a child.

Now bolster that with antisocial behavior of the parent.

The univers you live in is slightly different than the universe I live in as we likely intereperet different things differently purely from life experience.

So a child of a parent who goes out of their way to include, educate, and take the time to develope the child will in turn have a more solid understanding of the world than one who did not.

Health,"So one theory I’ve been looking at is that when there’s a lack of nutrients in cows they will tend to over eat on filler foods (ie corn). Cows are ruminants meant to be eating lots of different grasses and weeds while grazing and when they’ve had enough they just stop eating. In factory farming they just won’t stop eating corn when they technically should be full. 

It’s just an observation, but considering the soil depletion since the green revolution in agriculture and the extreme push for monocultures, the food we grow has been shown to be less nutritious, but still has the same amount of calories as the food from 100 years ago. 

That lack of nutrition, which can’t be made up by taking a supplement, might explain why we “fill the void” by continuing to over eat filler foods high in fat and carbohydrates. 

It also doesn’t help that those things in a processed form are made to be “addictive” so that you’ll eat more and by more. "

Substituting diet soda for sugar-sweetened versions during pregnancy also appeared to have negative effects. However, children’s fruit consumption had beneficial effects and was associated with higher cognitive scores.

Abstract:

Introduction

Sugar consumption among Americans is above recommended limits, and excess sugar intake may influence cognition. The aim of this study was to examine associations of pregnancy and offspring sugar consumption (sucrose, fructose) with child cognition. Additionally, associations of maternal and child consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), other beverages (diet soda, juice), and fruit with child cognition were examined.

Methods

Among 1,234 mother–child pairs enrolled 1999–2002 in Project Viva, a pre-birth cohort, in 2017 diet was assessed during pregnancy and early childhood, and cognitive outcomes in early and mid-childhood (median ages 3.3 and 7.7 years). Analyses used linear regression models adjusted for maternal and child characteristics.

Results

Maternal sucrose consumption (mean 49.8 grams/day [SD=12.9]) was inversely associated with mid-childhood Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT-II) non-verbal scores (–1.5 points per 15 grams/day, 95% CI= –2.8, –0.2). Additionally, maternal SSB consumption was inversely associated with mid-childhood cognition, and diet soda was inversely associated with early and mid-childhood cognition scores. Early childhood consumption of SSBs was inversely associated with mid-childhood KBIT-II verbal scores (–2.4 points per serving/day, 95% CI= –4.3, –0.5) while fruit consumption was associated with higher cognitive scores in early and mid-childhood. Maternal and child fructose and juice consumption were not associated with cognition. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, the association between maternal diet soda consumption and mid-childhood KBIT-II verbal scores remained significant.

Conclusions

Sugar consumption, especially from SSBs, during pregnancy and childhood, and maternal diet soda consumption may adversely impact child cognition, while child fruit consumption may lead to improvements. Interventions and policies that promote healthier diets may prevent adverse effects on childhood cognition.

&gt; Coal plant emissions damage infant DNA, a new study shows


&gt; A study from Columbia University has found notable differences in the DNA of neonatal babies born after a coal plant in China was shut down, compared with babies born in the same place while the plant was still operating and polluting the surrounding air.


&gt; Dr. Frederica Perera and Dr. Deliang Tang, researchers at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, found that babies born during the coal plant’s operation had shorter telomeres than those born after the plant’s closure — a result which seemed to validate the Chinese government's push to reduce air pollution.

Highlights

• Compared telomere length (TL) in babies born before and after a coal plant shutdown.

• Prenatal exposure coal pollutants (PAH) estimated by cord PAH-DNA adducts.

• Shorter TL previously associated with certain adverse health outcomes in adults.

• PAH-DNA adducts in cord blood associated with shorter TL.

• The second (post- intervention) cohort had significantly longer TL compared to the first.

Abstract

Background

To examine the molecular benefits of the government action to close the local coal burning power plant in Tongliang County, Chongqing Municipality, we compared biologic markers and health outcomes in two successive birth cohorts enrolled before and after the plant was shut down. In this city, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were primarily emitted by the coal burning facility. We previously reported that cord blood levels of PAH-DNA adducts (a biomarker of exposure) and various adverse health outcomes were reduced in the second cohort, whereas levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor/BDNF (a protein involved in neuronal growth) were increased. Here we assessed telomere length (TL), which has been associated with risk of certain chronic diseases, early mortality, aging and cognitive decline in adults.

Objectives

The goals of the present study were to determine whether TL differed between the two cohorts and whether prenatal PAH exposure, estimated by PAH-DNA adducts in cord white blood cells of newborns in China, were predictive of shorter TL in cord blood, suggesting the potential accrual of risk of certain chronic diseases during the prenatal period. We explored relationships of TL with BDNF and neurodevelopmental outcomes, each previously associated with PAH-DNA adducts in these cohorts, as well as the potential mediating role of TL in the associations between adducts and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Methods

We analyzed TL in cord blood of 255 newborns who also had data on PAH-DNA adducts, BDNF, and relevant covariates. Multiple regression analysis was carried out to test associations between adducts and TL and between TL and BDNF, adjusting for relevant covariates. In the subset with developmental quotient (DQ) scores from Gesell testing at age 2 (N = 210), we explored whether TL was a mediator of the relationship between PAH-DNA adducts and DQ scores by first examining the associations between cord adducts and DQ, cord adducts and TL, and TL and DQ, adjusting for the same covariates.

Results

As hypothesized, the mean TL was significantly higher in the second cohort compared to the first cohort. Overall, PAH-DNA cord adducts were significantly and inversely correlated with TL. Multiple regression analysis showed a significant association between adducts and TL, after adjusting for key covariates: β (effect size per standard deviation adducts) = −0.019, p = .003. The regression coefficient of TL on (Ln) BDNF was also significant (β = 0.167, p &lt; .001). Exploratory analysis, regressing TL on Gesell developmental scores, showed generally inverse, but not significant associations. TL was not, therefore, deemed to be a potential mediator of the association between adducts and developmental scores at age two.

Conclusion

This study provides the first evidence that prenatal PAH exposure from coal burning may adversely affect TL, with potential implications for future risk of chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease. The improvement in TL in the second cohort and the observed correlation between increased TL and higher levels of BDNF indicate direct benefits to the health and development of children resulting from the government's closure of the power plant."

Health,"A bit of a misleading headline to be fair... everyone pays the same to treat their cancer.  Flat pricing across all strengths now.  If you were on a higher dose the price comes down, if you were on the first approved dose  the price remains the same.  If you were on a lower (not proven regimen) the price increases.   The company started work 3 years prior to prove that the lower dose is safe and effective and understand which patients can benefit from it.  This significantly improves the scientific knowledge in treating cancer. It costs the company more than a $1.5 billion dollars to develop a drug and you only get a short window of time  to make the money back to fund more research to improve the lives of patients.   There are plenty examples of unethical pricing in pharma but this truly isn’t one of them.  Lastly - patients aren’t seeing the cost of these drugs directly ... it is the insurance companies.

So you admit that at best you can provide a weak argument. Interesting.

Here, how about another symphytum story told by my friend the dental surgeon: Gentleman is as fit a guy could be at 50 years old.  He’s an avid bow hunter.  If you know bow hunters, they’re as fit as they get.  He fell out of a tree and smashed up his shoulder, back, and rib cage.  A mutual friend, a dental surgeon that’s been using homeopathy in practice for the past 8 years, went to visit him five months after the accident and found him in a hobbled state.  The surgeon suggested he take symphytum 30c for two days, then symphytum 200c for two days, then stop.  From that point forward he began improving and after 6 months he’s completely recovered as if the fall and injury never happened.  

I have arnica stories like that in cases of contusions: head injury, blow to the arm, 800lb hunk of metal fell on a finger...all resolved rapidly after arnica.

Abstract

&gt; This case report offers rare insights into crossmodal responses to psychedelic drug use in a congenitally blind (CB) individual as a form of synthetic synesthesia. BP's personal experience provides us with a unique report on the psychological and sensory alterations induced by hallucinogenic drugs, including an account of the absence of visual hallucinations, and a compelling look at the relationship between LSD induced synesthesia and crossmodal correspondences. The hallucinatory experiences reported by BP are of particular interest in light of the observation that rates of psychosis within the CB population are extremely low. The phenomenology of the induced hallucinations suggests that experiences acquired through other means, might not give rise to “visual” experiences in the phenomenological sense, but instead gives rise to novel experiences in the other functioning senses."
